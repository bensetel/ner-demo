Law firms have been quite successful since 2022 at pushing more aggressive worked rate growth, putting them on solid footing for improving revenue outlooks. What likely started as an exercise to try to combat inflation now has set what is looking more like a new standard for rate growth.

–Thomson Reuters Institute in its [Law firm rates in 2023 report](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/law-firm-rates-report-2023/). Inflation gave firms an opportunity to raise rates in response, but if there’s truth to the theory that law firms were already [billing below their worth](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/lawyers-should-raise-their-rates/) the end of inflation may not put an end to these increases.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Let's Get This Party Started, Biglaw!

Thanksgiving is just days away, which means that bonus season is right around the corner. Wouldn’t it be nice if your law firm gave you a little something extra to be thankful for this year? We sure think it would be! As a little reminder (as if you really needed one), this is what [last year’s Cravath bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/) looked like:

Class of 2015 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2014 — $15,000
Class of 2013 — $25,000
Class of 2012 — $50,000
Class of 2011 — $65,000
Class of 2010 — $80,000
Class of 2009 — $90,000
Class of 2008 — $100,000
Class of 2007 — $100,000

For those of you who are wondering when your bank accounts will be a little more flush, here’s a list of the dates when year-end market bonuses hit Biglaw since 2006, the very first year Above the Law started publishing bonus news. Take a look:

With visions of bonus dollars dancing in your heads, it’s time to check in on how people are doing with their billable hours. There are just about six weeks to go in 2016, and this year, with [expenses outpacing revenues](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-strikes-back-the-rich-firms-get-richer-this-quarter/) at many firms thanks to [Biglaw’s base salary increase](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) from $160K to $180K, hitting your targets will be all the more important. Some firms might make bank-busting payments that will generate sweet headlines, but not all associates will hit the hours mark necessary for the top payment.

Still, with a month and a half to go, there’s plenty of time to game your stats. Clients should be prepared for their attorneys to drag out any assignments they get, because an extra 80 hours here and there could mean a world of difference to an associate.

So how are people doing? Take our poll, and get a sense of how many hours your peers are on pace to hit in 2016. While you’re at it, let us know when you think this year’s bonuses will drop, and whether they’ll be higher or lower than last year’s bonuses.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 11.30.18
## * Senator Tim Scott has effectively killed the district court nomination of Thomas Farr. At this point, the administration could just grab another name out of the hat of tons of nominally qualified North Carolina Republicans. But instead they'll just wait until the next session and redo this whole thing with their newly expanded majority to own the libs. [[Courthouse News Service](https://www.courthousenews.com/senate-delays-vote-on-controversial-court-nominee/)] * It looks like Trump may actually be zeroing in on a new AG. [[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/29/politics/trump-ag/index.html)] * The tech industry expects federal data privacy legislation next year. I don't know if these people have noticed, but it's unclear this upcoming legislature could pass a National Ice Cream Day resolution. [[Corporate Counsel](https://www.law.com/2018/11/29/federal-data-privacy-legislation-is-likely-next-year-tech-lawyers-say/)] * Former FBI chief James Comey is moving to quash a lame duck House subpoena. Comey's publicly declared that he's happy to testify before the committee in a public hearing. But, as you might imagine, the House Republicans don't want a public hearing where they won't be able to spin what happens. [[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress/ex-fbi-director-comey-asks-court-to-quash-republican-congressional-subpoena-idUSKCN1NY2UP)] * While everyone's predicted the death of the billable hour, it turns out that the antiquated billing mechanism has an unlikely defender: the clients. [[Law360](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1103869/law-firm-brass-say-clients-won-t-let-the-billable-hour-die)] * The new tax law will completely screw up divorces. Add that to the [overseas manufacturing incentives](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/11/29/sen-sherrod-brown-intv-trump-tax-plan-unaware-incentives-cut-sot-newday-vpx.cnn) as something Trump probably didn't realize when he dropped this dud of a law on the country. [[Fox17](https://fox17online.com/2018/11/29/tax-law-changes-affecting-divorce-cases/)] * Firms could get slapped with malpractice over substance abuse or poor mental health.

# Top 10 Biglaw Firm Finally Announces Bonuses, With Extra Money On Top For High Billers
## Associates weren't pleased that they were kept waiting for so long, but it was worth it.

Even though announcements may be slower in the new year, bonus season is still in effect. We continue to live in unprecedented times, and in 2021, that translated into one of the wealthiest Biglaw firms of all keeping associates nervously waiting with bated breath until the bitter end to find out whether their year-end bonuses would match the prevailing market rate.

Morgan Lewis & Bockius came in 7th place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, taking home $2,446,000,000 gross revenue in 2020. This firm can certainly afford to pay out big bonuses, but beginning in mid-December, we started receiving messages from worried associates, wondering why the firm hadn’t made an announcement yet. “Any idea why Morgan Lewis hasn’t announced bonuses?” an associate asked.

As we got later into the month, associates seemed a bit perturbed. “Any word about Morgan Lewis? Associates are definitely getting frustrated.” After Christmas was over and before the new year, associates were flat-out pissed. “It’s December 27th and Morgan Lewis still hasn’t announced bonuses. Would you be so kind as to drag them?” Yikes….

Associates at Morgan Lewis can now let out a huge sigh of relief, because the powers that be at the firm finally announced its bonuses via voicemail on January 1. Happy New Year, everyone!

A source tells us that MLB has matched the Cravath/Davis Polk scale for year-end and special bonuses, and that there’s an “extraordinary bonus” being added on top for high billers who hit a certain amount of hours above 1900.

Bonus money will likely be deposited into associates’ accounts later this month.

# Biglaw Firm Lays Off Attorneys To Ensure The Firm’s ‘Continued Success’

The Biglaw firm of Katten Muchin really went with the good news/bad news approach to their COVID-19 austerity measures.

In April, Katten Muchin put all of its [employees’ salaries on the chopping block](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-slashes-salaries-furloughs-lawyers-and-staff/?rf=1) while furloughing others, including business administration professionals and staff attorneys. Then [in June](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/am-law-100-firms-furloughs-have-turned-into-layoffs/?rf=1), some of those furloughs became permanent, but — at the time — attorneys were left unscathed. Spoiler alert: attorneys have now been laid off.

According to the firm, they “made the difficult decision to separate from a limited number of our attorneys and from some business professionals who have been on furlough,” though the exact number of impacted attorneys and other professionals is unknown.

In a [statement to Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/11/02/katten-parts-ways-with-attorneys-brings-back-some-furloughed-staff/), the firm said the layoffs were necessary to ensure the firm’s continued success:

“We do not take lightly the difficult decisions we have made,” the firm said in a statement. “We will be parting ways with wonderful colleagues whom we will miss. To position Katten for continued success, however, we must be vigilant to align our business with the challenges and opportunities presented by the current and future environments.”

Biglaw truly is a dog-eat-dog world.

But, for those still lucky enough to have work at the firm, there’s even more good news. The salary cuts will end as of December 1st, and attorneys will receive back pay as well.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

We are officially in the thick of Biglaw bonus season, with firms rushing to show their appreciation to hardworking associates with some cold, hard cash. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure will help you pay down your students loans.

The latest firm to announce their associate bonuses, of both the annual and special variety, is Baker McKenzie. In the grid below, you can see that not only is Baker McKenzie matching the year-end and special bonuses — for the class of 2020 and more senior — but they are also offering a 25 percent premium on both if associates hit the 2300-hour threshold.

Noticeably off this grid? The class of 2021. And believe you me, Above the Law has already started hearing from disgruntled stump-year associates wondering about their money. Now, it is true that these folks spent more than half the year not working at the firm, what with graduating law school and taking the bar exam. But Baker McKenzie made $2,899,834,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 4th on the Am Law 100. Certainly they have enough money to go around. And in a tight lateral market, one wonders why Baker McKenzie would want any compensation daylight between themselves and the competition.

You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/baker-mckenzie-bonuses-21/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

The holiday season is an opportune time to think not just about Biglaw compensation, parties, and vacations, but also about the less fortunate. It’s a time to be thankful for our blessings, but also to share those blessings with others.

So it’s appropriate that this time every year is when we learn about the latest class of [Skadden Fellows](https://www.skaddenfellowships.org/fellows-directory?skip=25&classYear=2024&hassearched=true). As we’ve explained in the past, these prestigious fellowships, the public-interest world’s version of Supreme Court clerkships or Rhodes Scholarships, allow their recipients to pursue public interest work on a full-time basis for two years. This year marks Skadden’s 35th anniversary since the inception of the program in 1988. Since then, Skadden has funded nearly 1,000 fellows.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Earlier this week, shortly before Thanksgiving, Skadden announced its 2024 class of fellows. These 28 graduating law students and judicial clerks will work in 17 cities in 13 states across the United States, focusing on such issues as disability rights, education equity, housing, immigrants’ rights, loan borrowers’ rights, LGBTQ+ healthcare rights, and environmental law.

For the 2024 class of fellows, Yale led the way with eight fellows, Berkeley produced three fellows, and Havard, NYU, Penn, and American minted two. The remaining law schools each placed one graduate into the program — including two newcomers to the list, the University of Iowa College of Law and the Hofstra University School of Law.

Congratulations to the new Skadden Fellows — and thanks to them, as well as Skadden Arps, for all that they do in service of the public interest.

Below, you’ll see the complete list of the 2024 Skadden Fellows and the organizations they’ll be working for.

# Power Niche Marketing: The First (Marketing) Threebie: Get Out And About
## Managing partner Bruce Stachenfeld shares the first of three keys to business development.

When I teach marketing to my young associates, as well as my partners, and when I need to remind myself what is important, I go to these three things, which I call the “Threebies.” Why do I call them that?  Being honest, just so it gets remembered, I gave it a kind of silly-sounding name.

These three Threebies are utterly critical to do. You cannot remind yourself of this enough times. If you master these – and anyone can master these as you will see – you are going to succeed at business development. And if you don’t really master them and internalize them, you are going to fail.

The first Threebie is very simple:  Get Out and About!

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
One of the great truisms of marketing and sales is that for those people who get “out and about,” good things (and bad things) happen to them. For those who don’t get “out and about,” nothing (good or bad) ever happens to them. They are essentially those “cold and timid souls” that Teddy Roosevelt referred to in his famous Man in the Arena [quote, ](http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trsorbonnespeech.html)who “know neither victory nor defeat.”

On this front, I can say safely, and with the certainty that comes from informal empirical verification over many years, that those who sit in their offices and answer the phone when it rings are dramatically less likely to be successful in marketing and sales than those who are always out and about – having breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and drinks, attending sporting or other events, learning and interacting with others in their industry.

This entire concept is an outgrowth of the [statistics issue](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/power-niche-marketing-the-great-marketing-revelation-it-is-all-statistics/) that I discussed in an earlier article. Those people who are out on the town – at a breakfast, at a lunch, at a seminar, at drinks with the girls or the boys, going out with people in the practice area, etc. – are the people who actually bring in clients and customers.

Sometimes this is loosely called “networking.” What is networking anyway?  Some people think it is some esoteric thing that requires an outgoing personality. But it isn’t. It is just two things:

An exchange of information; and

Two or more persons getting to know each to develop a comfort level so that they can work together or do business together

Said very simply, in networking you are just telling people what you do and having them tell you what they do, and seeing what pops out of that.

Whatever you may be thinking as you read this, I strongly urge you to get out of your chair, stop hiding behind your desk, and get “out and about.” You may feel like this is a waste of time, because at first you don’t know anyone and you have nowhere to go, but you have to admit that if you don’t get out and about, nothing is certain to happen; however, if you get out, then something “might” happen…..

You might be thinking that you don’t need me to tell you this as it is obvious, and you don’t need to read my article to tell you obvious things. Well, sorry for my French here, but that is utter bulls**t. I watch carefully what goes on, and almost all lawyers absolutely need me to tell them this because so many of them in fact just sit in their offices and don’t get out and about. Instead of being the like The Little Red Hen and hunting for leads, they sit back and largely wait for the opportunities to come to them.

And here is a weird, strange, and oddly inspiring statistic, at least in the legal and professional services world. If you want to be in the top 10% of professional service marketers, just do one single thing. This is because 9 out of 10 lawyers do absolutely no marketing at all!  So if you just do one thing, you are in the top 10%!!!!

That is kind of interesting, isn’t it?  I admit I read this in a book by David Maister called [Managing the Professional Services Firm](http://amzn.to/2suNICK) (affiliate link), and I am not sure these percentages are really true, but based on my own experience and observations, I think it is probably fairly accurate.

In any case, the first Threebie is to get out and about. Don’t sit around. Be like The Little Red Hen. She didn’t sit around. She went out and got it done.

My next two articles will – unsurprisingly – reveal the second and third Threebies….

# Biglaw Partner So Peeved By Pro Bono Assignment He Hits Reply All To Whine About It

There are pressing pro bono needs all around us — even before a pandemic triggered an economic crisis — and allocating the scarce resource of volunteer attorney time is always a challenge. But climate change is the sort of slow motion crisis that produces legal challenges that may be overlooked by firms so focused on the moment that long-term impacts get swamped in the battle for resources.

White & Case offers pro bono services to The International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Climate Change Specialist Group, and recently sent around an email looking for volunteers to help the organization put together a resource guide for attorneys litigating complex climate change issues that arise around the world. As pro bono calls go, it was a pretty straightforward one:

But Miami-based rainmaker Thomas Lauria wasn’t happy to see the firm’s attorneys volunteer to assist an organization helping foreign attorneys deal with the tangible impact of climate change. In an effort to put a stop to the effort, he deployed the dreaded “Reply All” button to lodge his concerns.



He likely meant for this to reach a more limited audience. But sometimes one seemingly small action, like hitting “reply all,” can have unintended ripple effects that create even more damage. Perhaps even damage that’s not immediately apparent and only manifests some time after the email is sent. It’s, like, metaphorical and stuff.

Putting aside that climate change is only a “political activity” to the extent that the Republican Party has decided to ignore multiple decades of scientific consensus, this doesn’t even make sense within the universe of White & Case’s past pro bono endeavors. White & Case [worked pro bono to challenge the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdbfwmXZOVI) that was just as “political” for reasons just as bad. And in this case the assignment is just helping attorneys in other parts of the world bring legally cognizable claims which shouldn’t be any more political than drafting a casebook.

But of course the complaint isn’t that the assignment is “political,” nor is it some kind of significant resource drain for a 2,000+ attorney behemoth, but that it’s a cause that runs afoul of Lauria’s personal worldview. And Lauria can try to own the libs if he wants (and while tipsters say he’s an admitted Trumpian, his political donation history is bipartisan), but that doesn’t mean he gets to dictate the efforts of a global firm of which he is ultimately a small part. There are firms in this world where one partner holds all the cards, but White & Case and its nearly $2B in revenue is not that firm. If the firm embraces efforts to help a nature conservation group, that’s something he needs to suck up. Part of being a partner is recognizing that the platform serves the rest of the firm too.

And in this case, if White & Case is trying to save the Miami office from ending up two feet underwater, that’s good for Lauria whether he’s willing to admit it or not.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Individualized Bonuses Lead To Disappointment At This Biglaw Firm
## Not exactly market bonuses for everyone.

Listen, here at Above the Law we love a good lockstep bonus memo. It sends a message of collegiality, avoids the[ problems of black box compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/jones-day-to-gender-discrimination-plaintiffs-you-dont-deserve-to-be-paid-on-the-cravath-scale/), and makes bonus season easy for Above the Law. But, not every firm is on board with that world view, like Perkins Coie.

The good news is that Perkins Coie has been sending around individualized bonus announcements. And, you know, any bonus is better than no bonus. But, according to tipsters, a bunch of associates are off the market scale set by Milbank last month. From a source:

You should call out Perkins Coie. Law students should know—if you come to Perkins, you are unlikely to make Cravath scale bonuses. I am an associate who billed over 1950 hours (which is the billable hours requirement at Perkins) and made substantially less than the Cravath scale for my class year. I have spoken to multiple associates who say that they have made less than Cravath scale bonuses (across all class years) in recent years as well. So this is not just a one-year thing—it’s been ongoing. This is interesting for a firm that touts itself as a “tier 1 firm.” You would think they would pay their associates like a tier 1 firm. Clearly not.

But like any firm with individualized bonuses, we depend on our readers to help fill out the details. So, are you a Perkins Coie associate? What do you think about bonuses this year? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

The moral of the story is, as always, our tipsters are essential to bonus season. We depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for all salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

# Pauline Newman's Doctor Has Some Choice Words For The Judicial Panel That Ruled Against Her
## The committee didn't follow the doctor's orders.

For decades, [Pauline Newman has been a respected name in IP](https://home.innsofcourt.org/AIC/Awards_and_Scholarships/Lewis_F_Powell_Jr_Award/Powell_Award_Recipient_Profiles/2018_Judge_Pauline_Newman.aspx). After several interventions from her coworkers, she’s more recently become infamous for daring to keep working at a job that she’s passionate about. Unfortunately, her dedication to the craft is being treated as a nuisance. Several of her colleagues have questioned her mental and physical health, [attacking her memory and accusing her of suffering a heart attack](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/a-lifetime-appointed-judge-was-accused-of-not-being-able-to-do-her-job-she-brought-receipts/). Based on a reading of the information presented, a Federal Circuit panel has recommended that she be suspended from judging for a year. Upon hearing the news, we now know that she isn’t the only person causing a fuss with their dissents — her doctor has voiced his disagreements too. From [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/doctor-who-examined-96-year-old-judge-slams-suspension-report):

A neurologist who examined Federal Circuit Judge Pauline Newman and deemed her fit to serve responded forcefully to a judicial committee’s recommendation to suspend the 96-year-old jurist.

[R]othstein said that when he examined Newman she “was eloquent, her responses were fluid and appropriate, and her examination did not indicate in any way that she was cognitively impaired.”
He took exception with how his examination, which was dated June 21, was described by the special committee—in particular a line in the committee’s report that said Newman “failed 80% of the memory related questions.”

“I feel it was a distortion and very inappropriate the way in which my opinion was altered to say something I didn’t say,” Rothstein said.

“I can tell you flat out there was nothing in my report,” Rothstein added, that suggested “she could not respond to questions appropriately.”

The panel’s unexpected outcome is in part due to a battle of the experts. The committee questioned the thoroughness of Rothstein’s report — one point of issue being if he considered conversations with the court staffers in his report.

# 50 Positions Will Be Eliminated By October 15th At This Biglaw Firm
## That's... a lot of layoffs.

With increasing frequency, we are seeing Biglaw firms revamp their model of business to become leaner. That means that staff often find themselves recipients of pink slips as the changes brought on by COVID-19 become permanent. The latest firm to cut staff jobs is Baker Botts, a firm that placed 58th on the latest Am Law 100 ranking.

[After recently](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/baker-botts-bonuses/) announcing bonuses for exceptional performance and walking back their [COVID-19 austerity measures](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/baker-botts-cuts/), the firm has decided to make some more big changes. Yesterday, leadership at the firm sent around an email, describing the new world the firm finds itself in:

Today’s environment is requiring that essentially all businesses re-examine every aspect of their operations and traditional assumptions, as we now see our daily work habits changing on a long-term basis. The way our lawyers and our support staff work together has experienced a fundamental shift.

As a prudent business, we must be responsive to this shift and ensure that we align our supporting resources with our clients’ and the Firm’s business needs in this changed environment.

That can mean only one thing: layoffs. According to the internal email, [available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/baker-botts-layoffs/2/), approximately 50 staff positions have been eliminated, and impacted employees will find themselves out of work next week (October 15th).

A spokesperson for the firm had this statement on the layoffs:

“Yesterday, approximately 50 staff members across the firm, in Office Services and Secretarial Services, were informed that their positions will be eliminated effective October 15. We will be parting ways with some wonderful people to whom we are deeply grateful for all they have done for the firm. However, we must be responsive to the fundamental workplace shift created by the pandemic to ensure that we align our supporting resources with our clients’ and our own business needs in this changed environment.”

As always, best wishes to those that suddenly find themselves out of work.

# More Law Firms Should Use Honesty Boxes To Solicit Feedback From Employees
## Partners can realize a number of benefits from having an honesty box.

Before starting [my own practice around a year ago](http://www.rothmanlawyer.com), I worked at a number of law firms. Partners at each of those shops told associates that they were amenable to feedback, and many related that they had an open-door policy if employees ever wanted to raise concerns or make suggestions. Of course, associates were usually nervous to provide feedback, and few people took advantage of open-door policies. Partners and pretty much everyone else often have a hard time accepting constructive criticism, and associates usually just kept their mouths shut rather than offer suggestions.

However, a few years ago, I was having dinner with a bunch of a attorneys after a deposition, and some of my colleagues told me about a unique initiative that was started at one firm to solicit feedback. Several of the attorneys at the dinner worked at a firm in my area that was infamous for having high turnover and low morale among associates. During the course of the dinner, many of the lawyers who had worked at this firm spent a substantial amount of time discussing well-known gripes about their former employer, many of which I had heard before.

However, my ears pricked up when a former attorney at this firm told me about a program that had been instituted while he worked there. The human resources person at the firm had set up an honesty box so that associates and other employees could give feedback to firm management anonymously. I immediately thought of an old Facebook app of the same name that people used in college to leave anonymous comments for their Facebook friends, which I always thought was a cool idea. I think the system set up by this firm was also internet-based, and firm management purportedly had no way of knowing who made the comments. I guess this idea was inspired by suggestion boxes that people might see at retail establishments, [or that was at the center of an episode of The Office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mIxqar0ldY).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
From speaking to associates who worked at this firm, it seems that reactions to the honestly box were mixed. Many of the attorneys at this firm did not think that the honestly box was truly anonymous, so a number of people did not even bother to submit feedback. Since there was so much turnover at the firm, many associates also did not care enough to submit suggestions that could improve it.

However, some people expressed gratitude that an honesty box program had been implemented. One attorney mentioned that the honesty box boosted morale around the office, since it showed that management cared about improving conditions at that firm. In addition, one associate told me he suggested that the firm implement a new employee benefits program, and soon thereafter, the firm decided to adopt that initiative. Judging from the comments of my colleagues, it was hard to tell if the honesty box provided substantial benefits, but the idea of this program intrigued me.

During the attorney review process at the firm at which I worked at the time, I decided to bring up the idea of an honesty box. There were many issues associates wanted partners to address, but most attorneys were afraid to make suggestions to management. Although partners professed to have an open-door policy, associates who made suggestions at meetings or in private were usually criticized and talked down to. One time, associates were even too afraid to tell management that the IRS had upped the mileage reimbursement amount! Because of the environment, no one wanted to make suggestions to management without anonymity.

My only suggestion to the firm when I was asked for feedback was that our shop should institute an honesty box program like the other firm had done. Predictably, firm management never took the proposal seriously. The partner I discussed the matter with told me that partners and associates had a good relationship at the firm, and doors were always open for feedback and comments. In addition, the partner thought that conditions were pretty good at the firm and that there would be no need for an honesty box to facilitate better feedback.

However, it is human nature to dislike people for making suggestions, and so long as associates feel they may face negative consequences from providing feedback, they will refuse to do so. In addition, even if associates did decide to use a firm’s open-door policy, it was rare that partners could have a long, substantive talk, since people are busy and it is hard to devote bandwidth to suggestions. An honesty box solves those issues, and the firm at which I worked could have greatly benefited from the idea.

Of course, honestly boxes are kind of a nontraditional proposal to consider, and firms definitely need to think outside the box (get it?) if they want to establish and promote an honesty box program. However, partners can realize a number of benefits from having an honesty box, since associates will be more likely to provide frank and helpful comments if they are able to convey feedback anonymously.

# Some Law Firms Have A Problem Keeping Up With The Joneses
## Law firms sometimes do not have the resources or infrastructure needed to offer certain kinds of benefits provided by other shops.

I worked at several different law firms over the course of my career [before I decided to open my own shop a few years ago](http://www.rothmanlawyer.com). As I transitioned from firm to firm, it was interesting to see how some firms had almost the exact same resources and initiatives as other shops even though I thought that such programs were original to the firm at which I previously worked. Of course, it is great when law firms copy good ideas from other shops, but sometimes, law firms do not have the resources or infrastructure needed to offer certain kinds of benefits, and this keeping up with the Joneses problem could actually hurt law firms.

At the beginning of my career, I worked at a firm that most people would consider a traditional Biglaw shop based on its international presence, head count, starting salaries, and other factors. This Biglaw shop spent money in unbelievable ways. For instance, they flew almost all of their first-year associates to their headquarters right after we all started at the firm for an orientation, and this must have cost an incredible sum. Moreover, the firm hosted an annual or biannual associates’ retreat at a well-known resort and convention center for all of the firm’s associates, and this must have cost a boatload. Among other resources at the firm, the shop had an in-house CLE program that was called “___ University” with the blank being the name of the firm. (I think I still have a tote bag somewhere that has this name on it!). The firm also spent incredible sums on branding and even produced a beautifully illustrated coffee table book about the firm that I still have to this day.

In any case, later in my career, I worked at a national law firm that in no way should be considered a Biglaw shop. The salaries of people who worked at this latter firm were far below what people earned in Biglaw, and the billable hours we charged were far below the rates at more prestigious firms. I assumed that because this latter firm was not a Biglaw shop, and presumably had less resources than Biglaw firms, this shop would not have the same resources as my prior firm.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Although the latter firm definitely did not have the same resources as the Biglaw shop at which I worked (such as a library staff, evening secretaries, and the like), I was shocked at how similar the offerings were at this latter firm to the Biglaw firm that previously employed me. This latter firm also had an in-house CLE program called “___ University” with the blank being the name of the firm, and this program was almost identical to the program at my Biglaw firm. I have learned through a little investigation that many firms have in-house training programs called “___ University” or “____ Academy” or the like (maybe firms changed to other names after Trump University got in hot water for using “University” in its name!), and if your firm has a similarly named program, please let me know — I’m interested to see if this is a trend among law firms.

In addition, this firm also spent boatloads of money to fly their associates to an associates’ retreat. I think this latter firm only had an associates’ retreat every other year, unlike my Biglaw firm that I believe had one each year, but this affair was similar to the associates’ retreat at my Biglaw firm. This latter firm put us all up in an extremely expensive hotel, arranged remarkable social events for us, and had the same team-building exercises and panel discussions that were present at the retreat at my Biglaw firm. In addition, this latter firm produced a beautifully illustrated coffee table book about the shop, and I have that book in my condo alongside the book produced by my earlier firm.

Of course, if law firms have the resources, they should offer initiatives like in-house CLE programs and associates’ retreats. Such programs make it easier for associates to work efficiently, and associates’ retreats can help foster collaboration among associates in different offices and help build a corporate culture at a law firm. However, the latter, non-Biglaw firm that I worked at likely did not have the finances to provide the same resources that were available at the Biglaw firm at which I worked. Indeed, this firm suffered serious financial issues, and although I am not too familiar with the inner workings of that firm, the shop clearly should have cut the fat.

It seems like some law firms like to give off the appearance that they are in the elite class of law firms, and this may require such shops to show that they have the same resources and initiatives that are available at more exclusive law firms. Of course, such a veneer can help law firms attract talent to a shop because attorneys would likely be more comfortable working at a law firm that has substantial resources that can support the work of attorneys. In addition, such a veneer may also help attract clients to a shop because many clients may feel more comfortable working with a law firm if they think that the shop is an elite class of law firms. However, law firms should not keep up with the Joneses if they do not have the finances to provide resources that may be available at more elite shops.

# The Two Sides To 'Hurry Up And Wait' Syndrome

Associate: “Damned partner! We didn’t have to send the brief to the client until Friday. But the partner insisted that I deliver the draft to him on Monday, four days before it was really due. I ruined my weekend working on the thing.

“And the partner didn’t even look at the brief until Wednesday! What a jerk. Why does this guy gratuitously ruin my weekend when he knows it’s not necessary?

“I hate this place.”

Partner: “I’ve been working at this place for more than 20 years. During those 20 years, three associates screwed me to the wall: The first time, a brief had to go out on Friday, so I asked for a draft bright and early Thursday morning. On Thursday morning, the associate said the brief wasn’t ready yet, but I’d get it on Thursday afternoon. On Thursday afternoon, the associate said the brief wasn’t ready, but I’d get it on Friday morning. On Friday morning, the associate said the brief wasn’t ready, but I’d have it on Friday afternoon. On Friday afternoon, the associate said the brief wasn’t ready, but I’d have it shortly.

“I told the associate that time had run out.  I needed the brief now, no matter what shape it was in.

“The associate gave me the brief.  It was a disaster.  I tried to patch it up in the 90 minutes that I had available, but it was hopeless. We needed more research; we had to reorganize the brief; it was poorly written.

“That’s never going to happen to me again. From now on, when a brief is due on Friday, I’m going to insist that the draft be delivered to me on Monday morning.  Then, when an irresponsible associate doesn’t give me the brief on Monday morning, I still have a couple of days to nag about the brief, while leaving myself enough time to fix the final product.”

Associate: “You’re talking about things that happened years ago that were inflicted on you by irresponsible associates! I’m different; I’m a responsible associate! I’ll get you a brief that’s in fine shape at precisely the appointed time. There’s no need for me to suffer because other associates were irresponsible in the past. The ‘hurry up and wait’ syndrome is unfair; it shouldn’t apply to me!”

Partner: “You’re very earnest and tell me how responsible you are. The associates who screwed me in the past were equally earnest and also told me how responsible they were. I can’t distinguish you from the associates of 10 years ago. Those associates looked and sounded exactly like you do today.

“I’m not risking it.  Maybe you’re responsible, and maybe you’re not.  I don’t know. But I’m telling you to deliver the brief on Monday morning — so that, when it turns out that you’re irresponsible, I still have time to recover.

“I know that’s not fair. But the alternative is to take the chance that I’ll have to send out bad work. I won’t take the chance. The brief is due on Monday morning.”

Many of my readers are young, so they of course side with the associate.

# You Can Lose Your Law License After Defaulting On Student Loans, And That's Messed Up
## If policymakers were truly interested in having student loans paid on time, they would not be suspending law licenses.

Everyone knows that there are serious consequences for defaulting on student loans.  Indeed, all of us are probably aware that defaulting on student loans can impact your credit score, which affects your ability to buy a house, purchase a car, or borrow money for any other reason.  In addition, defaulting on student loans can impact your eligibility for a security clearance and has a number of other impacts on someone’s life.

However, most people might not realize that you can have your law license suspended after defaulting on student loans.  In fact, if you live in nearly two dozen states, professional licenses can be suspended if you are not in good standing with your student debt.  In many ways, this consequence is perhaps more monumental than being dinged on your credit report or facing obstacles when obtaining certain kinds of employment.

Of course, the availability of [student loan refinancing options](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/student-loan-refinancing/) and [income-driven repayment plans](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/refinancing-student-debt/) makes it easy for many borrowers to stay current on their student debt.  However, it is still extremely messed up that individuals can have their law licenses taken away after defaulting on student loans.  Indeed, this consequence exhibits an unbelievable level of tone deafness and misunderstanding about student loans.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It is unclear why student loans are singled out as being so sacred that someone can have a professional license suspended for defaulting on their student debt.  Why can’t states suspend law licenses when people default on mortgages, car loans, or any other types of debt?  Of course, proponents of this policy might relate that student debt is borrowed so that an individual is eligible to practice law.  As a result, some might argue that there is a closer connection between student loans and a law license than other types of debt.

However, all kinds of debt are ultimately connected to being an attorney.  Indeed, one would not have the money to purchase a car or buy a home if they did not earn an income while practicing law.  As a result, there is really no special connection between student loans and a law license that warrants suspending law licenses after individuals default on their student loans.

Some might also believe that since student loans do not have any collateral, there needs to be special protections in place to ensure that attorneys pay off their student loans.  However, student debt already receives unique protections under the law.  Indeed, student debt is almost impossible to discharge in bankruptcy.  As a result, there is nothing unique about student loans that requires any type of special treatment by state licensing authorities.

Also, suspending a law license due to a student loan default is extremely counterproductive.  Many lawyers with student loans rely on their law licenses to earn a living.  And of course these individuals use the money they earn from practicing law to pay off their student loans.  If individuals can no longer practice law, how do state licensing authorities expect people to pay off their student debt?  If policymakers were truly interested in having student loans paid on time, they would not be suspending law licenses, since this actually impedes individuals from paying off student loans.

I really struggle with understanding why policymakers would empower licensing authorities to suspend law licenses if someone defaults on their student loans.  Perhaps banks and student-loan lenders are special interests that are more important to policymakers than student-debt borrowers.  Or maybe there is a belief that individuals who default on their student debt lack the financial responsibility and character to practice law.

Or perhaps ageism and misunderstandings about student loans are behind why laws suspending law licenses in the event of a student debt default are still on the books.  Such laws disproportionately affect younger professionals.  Indeed, it is usually people just starting out in their careers who have the most difficulty repaying their student loans.  In addition, individuals who have likely been practicing law for a long period of time (and are older) probably do not have student debt at all.  The fact that this one type of debt that disproportionately burdens the young is singled out for special treatment demonstrates that ageism may be behind why law licenses can be suspended because of student loan defaults.

Or perhaps policymakers just do not understand the modern realities of having student debt.  In the past, maybe it was inexcusable to default on student loans.  Indeed, it cost a much smaller amount of money to attend college and law school years ago, and this is even after adjusting for inflation.  In the present, however, [students must borrow massive amounts of student debt to earn a law degree](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/law-school-tips/).  In addition, the reality is that most law school graduates will not land a job that will enable them to easily pay off the large sum they borrowed to attend law school.  Perhaps older policymakers still think it is relatively easy to pay off law school loans, and this misunderstanding is the reason why law licenses can be suspended due to student loan defaults.

Of course, [there are few reasons to default on student loans](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/introducing-side-hustles/), since [numerous strategies can be employed to pay off student debt](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/introduction-repayment-strategies/).  However, if someone does in fact default on their student debt, they should not have their law license suspended.  There is no reason why student loans should get any special status, especially since ageism and misunderstandings about student debt are likely the reasons why such laws still exist.

## Norton Rose may still be a megafirm when it comes to revenue, but its American operations are experiencing serious brain drain.

When Abbe Lowell and 15 other lawyers announced their departures from Norton Rose, [we already had some inkling](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/after-all-these-attorney-departures-does-anyone-still-work-at-norton-rose/) that these departures might signal a larger trend at work. Through the first half of the year, partners have quietly walked away from Norton Rose, one or two at a time — with the exception of eight infrastructure attorneys that seemed, plausibly at the time, to be one of those one-off departmental moves that are just a fact of life in Biglaw these days.

But now, as we stand back from the Seurat that is Norton Rose Fulbright in 2018, the picture that’s developing is a firm with a whole lot of unhappy partners. And there’s no one merger that can be pegged as the source of the discontent.

Parsing through the press releases and chatting with some sources, we’ve pulled together a list of at least 38 attorneys who have decamped from Norton Rose this year — and 18 of them appear to be lawyers who never knew any firm but one of Norton Rose’s predecessor firms. Even in the cutthroat world of Biglaw, lateraling after spending decades at the same firm, working with the same partners, is a difficult decision. But as hard as it is to convince a lifer to move on from the only firm they’ve ever known, it gets a lot easier with each successive lifer who walks out the door. These things have a tendency to snowball.

So to say there’s a morale problem over there would seem to be an understatement.

How does a Biglaw firm lose the faith of so many senior attorneys — including attorneys like Jeff Layne, who left for Reed Smith last week, or Michael Pikiel, now with Winston, who sources say were considered within the firm as leaders being groomed for higher responsibilities throughout the verein? Sources say the problems are legion but fundamentally boil down to a cultural shift dictated by a detached management group.

There are a lot of reasons not to buy the [myth that mergers bring Biglaw happiness](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/22/debunking-the-consolidation-myth/), but one speed bump that merging firms never seem to consider is the chafing caused by bringing professionals with decades of experience into another institution with decades of experience of its own. And when a management structure doesn’t appear especially interested in bringing its new members into the fold, that’s going to inspire some phone calls to recruiters.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It doesn’t seem to matter if it’s legacy Chadbourne, legacy Fulbright, or a domestic Norton Rose partner with no prior ties — senior attorneys in the American offices have, as one source put it, “next to zero confidence in current management.” Under the firm’s more centralized structure, the horizontal distribution of power that prevailed in predecessor firms is gone, and wealth has rapidly concentrated at high levels at the firm.

As one might imagine, that’s the sort of management misstep that impacts young partners the hardest. It’s an old saw that partners make less in their first year of partnership than they did in their final year as a senior associate. According to people we talked to about Norton Rose’s rash of departures, junior partners are undercompensated relative to associates as many as four to five years into partnership. One source noted that the morale problem extends to senior associates who don’t see the opportunities that they did before leaving — this tip resonates when you recall that the mass lateral move to Reed Smith included more than one Norton Rose senior associate who lateraled into a partnership role. That’s not where a firm should be placing its up-and-coming leadership.

Unless, of course, the firm doesn’t really care about its future leaders. If management views America as little more than a revenue stream, it doesn’t need to get to the bottom of the unhappiness. The firm ranks tenth among the Am Law 200 for revenue. On the other hand, PPP is on the decline — not that this means much if the big earners are making the decisions.

If Norton Rose hopes to stanch the bleeding of its U.S. ranks, it probably should get on that quick because there’s no reason to believe we’ve seen the end of the exodus.

Ellisen Turner (Photo by James Goodnow)

As a senior associate at Irell & Manella, Ellisen Turner spent six months shadowing the firm’s then-managing partner, Elliot Brown. At the end of the experience, Turner made a vow: “That is the hardest, worst job ever, and I’ll never, ever take that job.”

Last week, Turner took that job.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Turner has garnered press attention in recent months for being [among the first African-American leaders of a major law firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/the-racism-you-have-to-get-through-to-be-a-biglaw-managing-partner/) in the United States. But the significance of Turner’s ascension goes far beyond race. I recently interviewed him at Irell’s headquarters in Los Angeles, and I met a man with a wealth of ideas and a vision that his partners at Irell are convinced will carry the firm through turbulent times of change.

Family, Firm, Clients

When you walk into Turner’s office, you immediately know he is not your typical lawyer. A string of vertical computer monitors, rotated to permit the former software engineer to easily study complicated patent filings, sits next to his treadmill desk.  The treadmill helps Turner stay physically fit despite the demands of his practice, and wipes out his occasional bouts of writer’s block.

A set of blocks on his couch stands ready to entertain his youngest children if they come to spend time with their father at work. A gigantic stack of blank cards towers on a table, for the many occasions Turner finds to send a handwritten note to a friend, client, or colleague.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Over Turner’s desk hangs the word “Commitment.” At first he thought he’d change it monthly, but he decided to commit to commitment. It’s his daily reminder of his commitment to family, firm, and clients, in that order.

The family-first mantra is made easier by the fact that Turner works just five minutes from his home, a rarity in Los Angeles. Turner takes full advantage. He often brings his kids into work with him, even if just for lunch or an afternoon. “When I grew up, I knew what my dad’s title was. I didn’t actually know what he did.” He says it’s important to him that his kids have a sense of what a professional workplace looks like, and what people actually do in an office, to serve them better later in life.

The philosophy extends beyond Turner’s own family. The firm has a “We Care” room where new mothers can nurse and spend time with their children. The outgoing managing partner made it a practice to visit sick firm members in the hospital, a tradition Turner intends to continue. Turner donated $1,000 of his own money to a staff member pursuing higher education. He tells me he sees his new role as a chance to touch people’s lives — something he enjoys immensely.

The Greatest Challenges Facing the Industry

For Turner, it’s essential to maintain that family-style culture as the firm embarks on a smart growth strategy. But that growth may be no small order. It’s been well documented that Irell has contracted significantly over the past several years, [dropping 27 percent in 2015](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/these_biglaw_firms_gained_and_lost_the_highest_percentage_of_lawyers_this_y) alone. The firm that once counted roughly 220 lawyers among its ranks is now down to 125.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Turner is unshaken by the statistics. He understands the hazards, but he believes the firm will weather the storm if it begins to rapidly adapt to the changing landscape.

He speaks to me with passion about the two great challenges he sees facing the modern law firm. First, he views the increasing commoditization of law, [a phenomenon I’ve written about before](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/sedgwick-death-by-billable-hours/), as a danger to both firms and the clients who hire them. His in-house counsel contacts are often forced into the difficult position of being viewed by management solely as a cost center. They’re valued only on how well they’re able to reduce the cost of legal services, regardless of whether that impacts quality.

As with lawyers, Turner says, “when you go to a doctor or if you have an accountant, in a lot of professional services, you get what you pay for.” As price competition continues unabated, Turner cautions his clients to ask whether the deals they’re being offered are too good to be true. “Why are they so willing to do it for this price, where other firms are not?”

The second major challenge Turner sees is the need to accelerate diversity within the legal profession. “It’s not just some altruistic thing, although there’s that too,” says Turner, who grew up in a Michigan town home to only three black families. “It’s because it leads to better outcomes. Studies have shown it, everybody knows it. The more input you have from a diverse group of people, the better your decision-making.”

Turner believes that becoming diverse is a business imperative, as more and more clients are refusing to work with firms that don’t mirror the population. The firms and schools that aren’t keeping their eye on diversity? “They’re doing everything with one hand tied behind their back,” he says.

Turner is setting a pro-diversity tone at the management level. He added questions to the partners’ annual self-assessment asking what each partner has done to promote diversity within the firm. “They’re going to have to think about it every year,” he says, “and when they go into the start of the year, say ‘I’m going to be asked this question. What can I do next year to put something in that box?’”

Adapting to a New Generation

As I speak with Turner, I notice his socks. Rather than the silk stockings stereotypically worn by leaders of firms with profits per partner in excess of $3 million, they have a colorful, psychedelic pattern — more Kardashian than Perry Mason. The socks are emblematic of the perspective Turner brings to the position.

The winner of a slew of “40 under 40” awards in the past several years, Turner is not shy about saying his background and generational perspective will be tools he uses to help break with tradition. “The way law firms have operated, historically, is not necessarily for everybody in the new generation,” he says.

Turner notes, for instance, that many newly minted attorneys aren’t as interested in making partner or being the last to leave the office every day, so criteria for promotions has to change. And in a fast-changing world, partners also need to be open to hearing ideas from all attorneys. “Innovation,” Turner opines, “has to come from the ideas of people.” Consequently, he says, firms must “not have the bureaucracy stand in the way of someone bringing an innovative idea and trying that out.”

If there’s a thread to Ellisen Turner, it seems to be this: Whether it’s his family, his partners, his staff, or his community, Turner doesn’t let people fall through the cracks. And if he has a chance to fill in the cracks, even in a job that can grate on him, he’s going to take it.

The vast majority of law firms in our space are cognizant of the desire to keep good people, and firms will try and be as creative and sensible as possible to keep people on.

But it depends on how deep and long the recession is. If things don’t start to pick back up in Q3 or Q4, the implications will be much much harder. Any business that says they will not change their headcount, they simply don’t know yet.

— [Lee Ranson](https://www.eversheds-sutherland.com/global/en/who/people/index.page?person=en/Ranson_Lee(598)), co-CEO of Eversheds Sutherland, in comments given to [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/2023/01/03/expect-worse-in-2023-uk-law-firm-leaders-say-292-138405/), when discussing what the Biglaw associate and partner talent war will look like in 2023, in light of the negative economic forecast. “There’s no real serious commentator that isn’t saying there’s not going to be a downturn of sorts,” he said. Ranson also noted that managing budgets and salaries will be “a big part” of the year.

Dana Hyde (Image via Millennium Challenge Corporation)

The woman who died after the aircraft she was on hit “severe turbulence” has been [identified](https://www.cspnews.org/post/passenger-identified-in-medical-emergency-at-bradley-international-airport) as D.C. attorney Dana Hyde. Hyde was one of five people on the corporate jet owned by Conexon when it hit turbulence over New England on Friday. The plane made an emergency landing at Bradley International Airport just north of Hartford, Connecticut, and Hyde was rushed to Saint Francis Medical Center where she was pronounced dead. The medical examiner’s office revealed she died of blunt-force injuries.

Hyde was on the plane with her husband, Conexon partner Jonathan Chambers, along with their son and two crew members. No one else was injured.

As [reported by](https://apnews.com/article/turbulence-jet-passenger-killed-trim-ntsb-d40ce82b8d61f63d60016afd42a7fd07) the Associated Press, the National Transportation Safety Board is looking into the cause of the turbulence:

The National Transportation Safety Board said it’s looking at a “reported trim issue,” a reference to adjustments that are made to an airplane’s control surfaces to ensure it is stable and level in flight. The agency initially reported that the plane experienced severe turbulence late Friday afternoon.

Last year, the Federal Aviation Administration instructed pilots flying the same model of Bombardier aircraft to take extra pre-flight measures after trim problems had been reported.

Hyde was a graduate of Georgetown University Law Center, and was a veteran of Biglaw (WilmerHale’s London office). Hyde’s public service is [also notable](https://worldprojects.columbia.edu/node/192). Under the Clinton Administration, she was the Special Assistant to the Deputy Attorney General. Hyde also served as counsel to the 9/11 Commission. In the Obama Administration, Hyde was tapped as Chief Executive Officer of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), Associate Director at the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Senior Advisor to the Deputy Secretary of State. At the time of her death, Hyde was part-time consultant at the D.C. think tank Aspen Institute and co-chair of the Aspen Partnership for an Inclusive Economy.

Above the Law’s condolences go out to Hyde’s family, friends, and colleagues at this difficult time.

Today, a unanimous three-judge panel of the [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit](http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov) — in [an opinion](http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2016/D12-14/C:15-2076:J:Sykes:aut:T:fnOp:N:1879107:S:0) written by Circuit Judge [Diane S. Sykes](http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=3074&cid=999&ctype=na&instate=na) — reinstated the husband’s Wiretap Act claim against his estranged wife.

# Biglaw Holiday Decision Tree: Do You Have To Work The Friday After Thanksgiving?
## How can you tell if you need to be working on Black Friday? Allow us to help make your decision easier.

Ed. note: This post was originally published on November 21, 2013. We republish it today as a public service to any Biglaw folks who are wondering if they need to go into work today.

My first “Black Friday” (that’s the Friday after Thanksgiving for those who reject consumerism in all of its forms) while working in Biglaw, I went into the office. My second Black Friday, I went to the therapist. I didn’t make it to my third one.

Thanksgiving is this week, and while you certainly shouldn’t have to work on Thursday, Friday is a different matter. So, we’ve put together this helpful decision matrix to figure out if you actually have to drag yourself into your Biglaw office on Friday… or if you can sleep off your turkey hangover surrounded by your family and/or the escort you paid to make your holiday feel less empty.

Ed. note: As an aside, in the past we got a complaint over the “immigrant” item in the decision tree. Anyone who has worked in Biglaw for any length of time will recognize the issue: bosses who want to appear accommodating will pile work on lawyers who they perceive as uninterested in the American holiday and, more importantly, the plight of lawyers with visas that prevent them from pushing back on those assignments.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Strikes, Suitemates, And Stuffing A Sock In It

Posture. I am not using that in the meaning that first comes to mind: how we stand or not, slump or not. There’s a different kind of posture, the posture that we present in litigation and negotiations, the posturing of one position or another, or multiple postures depending on the emergence of facts that either support or don’t support our positions. Our postures change as the facts change.

What does it mean to posture? Does that help in litigation or hurt? (Remember, I am a mediator, so my goal is to help resolve the case, not extend it.) Very few in our heartland (i.e., between the Sierra Nevada — singular, please — and the Hudson River) will care very much about the current labor strife between various entities in the entertainment industry until there’s no new content to watch and stream. (Dinosaurs: remember summer reruns?) The Writers Guild of America has been on strike for almost three full months, and SAG-AFTRA (the actors union) just joined the writers on the picket lines this past Friday.

Among the issues are those related to salary (top of mind in every strike) and residuals (how much do writers and actors receive when a show runs multiple times). There is also the issue of economic inequality between management and labor (those not in the multi-million-dollar salary categories), and how that gap continues to widen (like other industries).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
What’s different in these walkouts is the looming presence of AI, what to do about it, how to manage it, and how it will affect the industry going forward. This is not an academic question but one that goes to the very essence of how work gets done. (Sound familiar? Of course, it does.) Our profession has similar, but not necessarily identical, concerns, now and in the future.

Right now, the unions have made their demands. The AMPTP (the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, e.g., the studios, Netflix, Amazon, and others) has made its offer, and the [gaps between the sides](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-07-18/sag-aftra-strike-offers-from-amptp) are the width of the Grand Canyon. A federal mediator was called in at the last minute, but there was no further extension of the SAG-AFTRA strike deadline, so the strikes by both unions are in full swing. Right now, there’s finger-pointing and some trash talking (posturing?) but that doesn’t necessarily last very long when the slog drags on. Positions can harden even more and then it becomes even tougher to resolve due to ego clashes.

As lawyers, we know, all too well, that no one gets their full wish list satisfied when, inevitably, an agreement is reached. Then the parties must decide whether they can live with the resolution as opposed to hanging tough. Unanswered questions include how much economic pain each side will inflict on the other, just exactly “when” is long enough, and how to avoid the perception that one side or the other will “cave” (a legal term not taught in law school).

When I heard that one side was “celebrating” that the actors would join the writers on the picket lines, I thought that “celebrate” was not the right word. Hardly a festive moment for anyone, and there already is and will continue to be mounting collateral damage for those who provide goods and services to the industry. It’s not just the weather temperatures that are rising. It will take time even to get the parties in the same room, let alone talking again.

On another subject, solos and small firm practices should be especially interested in [this brand new ethics opinion from the ABA discussing office-sharing](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/aba-formal-opinion-507.pdf). The opinion says to be careful whom you share space with, that conflicts and ethical issues regarding representation can lurk, especially when it comes to client confidentiality. So how does this work in the real world?

Are potential suitemates obligated to find out who other lawyers in the suite have as clients? Would that be a breach of client confidentiality? Often, law suites share printers, scanners, and other office equipment. How to make sure that another person in the suite doesn’t pick up a suitemate’s document by mistake? Are attorneys required to lock up all files (even those presently being worked on) at the end of every workday? Some due diligence is a good idea, but how far should this due diligence go?

The opinion reminds attorneys sharing office space to avoid imputation of conflicts, such as taking on potential new matters adverse to clients represented by other office-sharing lawyers, as well as potential pitfalls when consulting with fellow suitemates. Every situation is fact specific, but the opinion says that lawyers in the same office who represent clients with adverse interests may be obligated to disclose the details of the office-sharing arrangement to their clients, including efforts to maintain confidentiality, and to obtain each client’s informed written consent. Easier said than done? And what about if office space is shared with other professionals, such as CPAs?

And last, but not least, is anyone else tired of all the “humble brags” on LinkedIn? Marketing gurus advocate that there is no such thing as too much posting and stress that there’s always the need to be top of mind. But at some point, at least to me, and I can’t believe I am the only one, the consistent “it’s all about me” is a turnoff. And no, I am not making that up: Exhibit A for the “humble brag” is the woman who wanted to [include her class rank in her wedding vows](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/bride-wants-to-mention-t14-class-rank-in-wedding-vows/).

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Whew, it looks like today is the day that Biglaw gets *really* serious about these associate raises. It’s been the busiest raise day since Milbank pushed open the floodgates last Thursday, and we are here for it.

It was only earlier today that [we lamented the… slowness](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/hh-raises/) of West Coast firms at adopting the new, $205,000 compensation scale set by Davis Polk. Now, a veritable California mainstay, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, have announced they are onboard with raises for on-track associates and Of Counsel in China, Hong Kong, U.K., and the U.S.

Class	Comp Year	Annual Base Pay
Fall Associates	2021	$202,500
First Year	2020	$205,000
Second Year	2019	$215,000
Third Year	2018	$240,000
Fourth Year	2017	$275,000
Fifth Year	2016	$305,000
Sixth Year	2015	$330,000
Seventh Year	2014	$350,000
Eighth Year	2013	$365,000

The firm also noted that summers will get a pro rated cut of the $202,500 salary. Raises for associates and Of Counsel beyond the class of 2013 will be communicated separately, while senior counsel, staff attorneys, and other non-partnership track attorneys will have to wait till year-end for any extra money.

You can read the firm’s[ full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/wsgr-raises/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

[Deferrals] will bleed into the East Coast. If firms can operate at 80% of capacity and still do the work, they will. It is only a matter of time before East Coast firms follow suit. And their profitability numbers will be through the roof.

— [Greg Hamman](https://decipherintel.com/greg-hamman/), director of business insights at legal data and consulting firm Decipher Global, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/10/big-law-associate-deferrals-bleed-into-east-coast/) concerning the recent rash of deferrals of incoming Biglaw associates. Thus far, the following firms have deferred some or all of their incoming first-year associates: [Gunderson Dettmer](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-firm-lays-off-10-of-its-workforce-may-defer-incoming-associates/); [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/after-layoffs-last-year-cooley-delays-start-date-for-first-year-associates/) (plus, a second deferral [corporate associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/cooley-deferral-corporate-associates/)); [Fenwick & West](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/fenwick-deferral-associates-corporate-technology/) (corporate and technology transactions associates); [Perkins Coie](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/perkins-coie-is-the-next-firm-to-defer-incoming-associates/); [Orrick](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/orrick-layoffs-deferral/); [Cadwalader](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/cadwalader-defers-incoming-associates-2024/); [Katten Muchin](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/katten-layoffs-2023/) (a “portion” of incoming associates deferred); and [Dechert](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/dechert-optional-deferral-incoming-associates/) (optional deferral).

# Biglaw Firm With The Most Revenue Makes Another Round Of Raises
## More big raises for hardworking associates.

Kirkland & Ellis has consistently brought in the top revenue numbers in all of Biglaw. Given that — and particularly against a backdrop of a white-hot lateral market — the firm was almost assuredly going to match the top compensation numbers recently [announced by Cravath.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/)

Sure, they’d already [announced raises less than a week ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/top-revenue-firm-hops-on-associate-raise-train/), but when there’s a new compensation grid making the rounds, well, you have to pony up the cash to keep associates happy.

So, here is the new associate compensation grid at Kirkland:



As you can see from the chart, associates are getting a full match of the Cravath scale, retroactive to January 1. And while the firm maintains its commitment to paying top of the market for its non-share partners, tipsters are annoyed at the retroactive date for the NSPs:

However, if you are a non-share partner, they send a separate memo and only back pay to February 1 (not January 1), effectively shorting you over $4,000 for the month of January. Would love to see that accurately reported, so they have some accountability for shorting the NSPs.

You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/kirkland-re-raises-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Some Lawyers Might Have Difficulty Reading Books For Pleasure
## Is this is a broader phenomenon in the legal industry?

Before I became a lawyer, I was an avid reader of all kinds of books. I enjoyed immersing myself in novels, and typically, I would find a good series and devour all of the books an author wrote on a particular subject. I also appreciated a good biography and would regularly pick up books about all different kinds of nonfiction matters that interested me. Since becoming a lawyer, I find that I do not read books nearly as much as I used to, and perhaps lawyers just might not get the same enjoyment out of reading as people who work in other fields do.

As a lawyer, I read all kinds of materials constantly during my working hours. When I conduct legal research, I typically need to read dozens of cases and digest all of the information that is included in such opinions. When reviewing discovery, I often need to read thousands of pages of emails, medical records, contracts, and all of the materials that were produced in that case. While negotiating commercial deals, I typically need to review long leases, voluminous asset purchase agreements, and all manner of documents associated with the deals upon which I am working. Reading all of these materials as a lawyer can not only be tiring on the eyes, it can fatigue legal practitioners to the point that they do not want to read for enjoyment in their personal time.

As a result, in my personal time, I am much more likely to watch television and movies. I also frequently play video games in my free time instead of reading. These activities do not involve the same energy as reading books, and since this is such a big departure from the reading I do at work, the movies, television programs, and video games are all far more enjoyable than reading for pleasure in most instances.

Of course, I am not saying that I never read anything for pleasure. Indeed, I usually keep some books on my phone and iPad for times when reading is the most convenient activity, such as when I’m on public transportation, waiting in line, or on an airplane. In some rare instances, I will pick up a book to relax a bit before going to bed. However, I rarely pick up a book and read when I am at home during designated leisure time like I used to.

This has definitely had some negative impacts on my life. Reading books can be a point of connection between individuals. Since I started practicing law, there have been a few popular books that friends or family have read that I just didn’t have the time or inclination to attempt. This has made it more difficult to connect with people who are better-read than I am — I probably would not be invited to the [Finer Things Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kpo4qHM9gw) with my current habits. Moreover, I might have an information gap in some areas since I have not been reading as many non-fiction works as I used to. Moreover, the leisure and enjoyment of reading, and the relaxation it can provide is generally different from other kinds of entertainment, which I am missing out on since lawyering generally turns me away from recreational reading.

A few other lawyers I polled seem to have the same issue as I do and find that they do not enjoy reading as a practicing lawyer even though they were avid readers before entering the legal profession. I would be interested to hear from readers to find out if this is a broader phenomenon in the legal industry and to get some tips lawyers might use to motivate themselves to read for pleasure even though we read all day for work. But it seems that until artificial intelligence does the reading for us in the legal field, many lawyers may have a difficult time reading for pleasure.

Greg Craig

In Police Academy 7: Mission To Moscow, the sad hangers-on from the first barely above average movie aid the Russian government in fighting the security threat posed by Tetris. That’s… actually the plot. In any event, the bumbling hijinks that transpire bear a shocking resemblance to Skadden’s now infamous work providing cover for the Russian-backed Ukrainian government that coasted to power on the back of widespread voter fraud.

Skadden associate Alex van der Zwaan has already pleaded guilty. Counsel Greg Craig, Obama’s former White House Counsel, [mysteriously left the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/amid-mueller-probe-prominent-skadden-counsel-disappears-from-website/), and now we know that Mueller referred the case against Craig for potentially operating as an unregistered foreign lobbyist to the S.D.N.Y. months ago.

While the S.D.N.Y. managed to keep mum on the Craig case until now, that’s no reason to believe they aren’t interested in it. A couple months is hardly any time at all in the lifespan of a federal prosecution, especially one that overlaps so many other inquiries.

Regardless, this news, along with news that Dem power player Tony Podesta got the same referral should finally put a stop to Trump’s whining that Mueller is only snagging Republicans lending an improper helping hand to Putin’s interests.

Gabriel MacConaill

The death by suicide of Sidley Austin partner Gabe MacConaill continues to rock the world of Biglaw. Not only did he die in a dramatic fashion — his body was found with a[ self-inflicted gunshot wound](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/biglaw-partners-death-due-to-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound/) in the firm’s parking garage — but after his death, his widow, Joanna Litt, [wrote a provocative op-ed](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-widow-blames-firm-for-husbands-suicide/?rf=1) titled “Big Law Killed My Husband.” That one-two punch put a lot of attention on the stresses of Biglaw and the mental health and services available in the industry.

Now MacConaill’s death has become part of a larger conversation. Financial Times has [written an article](https://www.ft.com/content/1e8293f4-a1db-11e9-974c-ad1c6ab5efd1) about mental health issues in the workplace, and MacConaill is featured in the story. The details of the stress MacConaill was under before his death are familiar to those who know his story — and  anyone who’s spent time in Biglaw will recognize the outlines — and are rehashed for this new audience. He was working on the massive Mattress Firm bankruptcy case and other partners in his department had recently left, pushing him into a leadership role and leaving MacConaill without the support of partners. In prepping to file the Mattress Firm bankruptcy in Delaware, MacConaill worked himself to exhaustion, going to the ER with cardiac symptoms but when there were early indications his health issues were caused by dehydration, he left the hospital without being seen by a doctor so he could return to work. As FT reports, that was a critical warning sign:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
That evening, Litt called one of MacConaill’s close colleagues. “I said, ‘My husband’s in crisis. What do I do?’” she remembers. “And she told me, ‘I don’t know.’ I said, ‘Who do I call?’ She said, ‘I don’t know.’ ” Litt arranged a mobile IV to come to their home, give MacConaill fluids and prepare him for the final stretch of the case. He then flew to Delaware to file. When he returned to LA, he called in sick from work, stayed at home and stopped answering his work emails.

On Sunday morning, MacConaill told Litt he was going into the office. A few hours later she received a call from [Dan Clivner, managing partner of Sidley Austin’s Los Angeles office]. They had found MacConaill’s body in the Sidley Austin parking lot, next to his car.

Dan Clivner, managing partner of Sidley Austin’s Los Angeles office, told FT that it was MacConaill’s responsibility to come forward and ask for help when he was overwhelmed:

“When you call in with something like cancer or stress, in a discreet and professional way the firm will respond,” he says. “On the first day of every orientation that I’ve done for decades, I say, ‘You have to raise your hand.’ In a place like this, you have to be able to say, ‘I haven’t done deals, I’d like to do deals,’ or ‘I’d be interested in travel,’ or ‘I’m overworked.’ You have to trust somebody.”

And, despite the criticism Litt has leveled at the firm, Clivner stands by the firm’s response to MacConail’s death:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Simply put, I’m exceptionally proud of the way the firm handled the announcement and communication of his death without stigma, without embarrassment, without hiding it,” says Clivner. “They don’t teach you this in law school and for myself personally, and for the firm, we did it right.”

But in the FT article, Litt doubles down on holding the firm to account for the events that led up to her husband’s death, and is angry at the firm’s lack of a robust response since MacConaill died:

In the months since, she feels Sidley Austin’s response has been minimal. “The two managing partners of the bankruptcy division did not call me, email me, send me a letter,” she says. “I still haven’t heard from either partner. I also didn’t hear from the slightly senior partner who Gabe was working Mattress Firm with. None of them.”

Clivner says he is proud of the firm’s wellness program, though he admits it hasn’t change since MacConaill’s death. But FT also spoke with an anonymous source at the firm who agreed that whatever wellness program the firm has in place, folks at Sidley aren’t comfortable availing themselves of it:

“There are resources available, of course,” says a former colleague. “But there is not a culture or feeling of safety right now in that set of offices. You can have resources in place, but unless you have the right culture, people aren’t going to feel safe using them or approaching someone to ask for help.”

Litt titled her op-ed “Big Law Killed My Husband,” not the firm killed my husband, and that rings true because whatever the particulars of what led to MacConaill’s death, the attitudes are industry wide. [Too often](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/suicide/) the demands of the profession mask real mental health issues, and the overachievers drawn to the law don’t feel able to avail themselves of these necessary services. The [stigma](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/biglaw-partner-stresses-that-you-need-not-suffer-in-silence-with-depression/) is something we see throughout the legal industry, and is what needs to be dismantled to prevent more of these tragedies.

Yesterday, former Morrison & Foerster office operations manager, Andrew Robertson, pleaded guilty to felony mail fraud. Appearing via video in federal court Robertson admitted to for using a firm credit card to make $425,000 of unauthorized personal purchases.

Robertson’s job at MoFo included having a purchasing card and he was able to approve certain orders, including office supplies, renovation matters, and catering. But Roberston now says he took advantage of that and instead used firm funds to buy things for himself. Robertson’s haul [reportedly](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/04/21/ex-morrison-foerster-operations-manager-pleads-guilty-to-bilking-firm-of-425k/) included Prada jeans, watches, a 60-inch television, more than a dozen pairs of Air Jordans, an Apple laptop, a sleeper sofa from Crate & Barrel, a 24-inch gold chain necklace, a 1980s-style prom king costume, and a white-gold pinkie ring.

During the plea hearing, assistant U.S. attorney Kathryn Rakoczy detailed Robertson’s scheme, saying the defendant doctored receipts to make them look like they were for offices expenses. For example a $250 pair of Prada jeans purchase was submitted as computer monitor-related equipment.

Robertson worked at MoFo from February 2017 to November 2018, when he was fired. When the allegations first became public, the firm offered a comment:

A spokesperson for Morrison & Foerster last year told ALM that the firm terminated Robertson and told law enforcement after it “discovered his alleged stealing of firm property” during an internal audit. “Mr. Robertson’s actions did not impact any of the firm’s clients. We are fully cooperating with law enforcement on this matter,” the firm said.

Sentencing will take place on August 16th.

[Lake Whillans](http://lakewhillans.com/), a leader in the field of litigation finance, supports innovative entrepreneurs and businesses across the country, including those in vital epicenters of tech innovation. Throughout the year, we have explored the legal markets in these hubs, each unique in its own right.

So far, we’ve looked at the “[White Sandal](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-white-sandal-elite-the-go-to-law-firms-of-silicon-valley/)” firms of Silicon Valley and “[Route 128 Elite](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/rt-128-elite-the-go-to-law-firms-of-boston/?rf=1)” of Greater Boston — both indisputable markets where all manner of innovation is thriving.

Today, we look to the states of the “Wild West” — including Texas, Colorado, and Utah — which are home to an impressive amount of startup activity. Depending on which survey you believe, either [Austin](http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2016-10-28/austin-as-tech-hub-myth-or-reality/) or [Boulder](http://www.inc.com/magazine/201312/boulder-colorado-fast-growing-business.html) can claim to lead the country in high-tech startups per capita. Meanwhile, the “Silicon Slopes” of Utah have emerged as a hotbed of entrepreneurship, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce [recently ranking](https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/enterprisingstates/#UT) the state No. 1 in innovation.

As more and more partners head for the exits, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan’s urge to merge has grown even stronger, so much so that the firm was willing to change its ways (i.e., its pension liabilities) to find the right partner.

When we last checked in with Stroock, the firm had authorized a vote of the retired partners to [dump its pension obligations](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/biglaw-firm-tries-to-dump-its-pension-plan-to-become-more-eligible-merger-partner/) through a buyout. But even with the vote underway, still more partners departed from the firm, with the latest being a group of five restructuring partners headed to Morgan Lewis.

But now, Stroock seems to have made positive progress on becoming a more attractive merger partner. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/07/stroock-loses-bankruptcy-chair-in-five-partner-exit-to-morgan-lewis/) has the details:

[T]he law firm said on Monday it has secured the vote to end its pension obligation and it is optimistic about reaching a merger. …

While the retirees were due to vote by Tuesday this week, Stroock indicated on Monday that they approved it.

The firm offered the following statement to Am Law: “Now having secured the votes needed to end our pension obligation, we are optimistic about achieving a desired merger.”

The firm has previously been involved in merger talks with McGuireWoods, Steptoe & Johnson, Squire Patton Boggs, and Nixon Peabody, but nothing has worked out. Maybe there’s finally some hope for the firm now that it’s nixed its pension problems.

# Just Another Roll Of The Dice
## David Cambria gambles big at Baker McKenzie.

When I met David Cambria back in 2007, we hit it off immediately. Not only did I like him very much, but I was thrilled to find an expert who would talk to me about the ins and outs of legal operations. For David’s part, I think he was happy to find someone — anyone — who cared about his role and was interested in helping others see the value it can deliver.

It may have been at that very first lunch that we agreed to collaborate on the first Survey of Law Department Operations. Since then, we’ve put out 10 more, spoken on the same panel maybe a dozen times, thought about starting a business together, and almost got in a fight with some guy who couldn’t find the mosh pit at a Frank Turner show. (Hint: It’s right in front of the stage.)

Still, I was a bit shocked when he called me up last month and told me he was moving to Baker McKenzie.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Perhaps I shouldn’t have been surprised. David’s been telling me for a year that law firms are finally ready for the type of changes he’s been working towards and advocating for in-house. That if law departments are changing the way they are buying, then law firms must change the way they are delivering. I just never thought he’d jump. “Law firms are where corporate law departments were 10-15 years ago,” he says. “So to have the opportunity to shape and drive that change was appealing.”

I see his point. David has spent the better part of his career helping law departments align with their business units. “Legal operations is a set of disciplines that facilitate the delivery of legal advice,” he says. So if law departments can develop the discipline to better serve their clients, why can’t a law firm develop the discipline to serve theirs?

One reason is that they are not really incentivized to. According to the [2017 Law Department Operations Survey](http://blicksteingroup.com/ldo-survey/), published in cooperation with Consilio, less than a third of respondents describe their law firms as innovative, but few are holding their feet to the fire.

It’s easy to forget that a decade ago, law departments were not incentivized to either. A general counsel could usually get the finance team to stand down just by saying “but legal is different” or “it’s too risky.” Eventually, the finance and business units — spurred on by the Great Recession — got fed up and law departments were forced to react and that reaction required the skill set of the LDO professional.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Maybe we are, in fact, at the point where law firms will start to feel the need to leverage process improvements and technology implementations and new pricing models. “I’ve worked with a lot of law firms, and there are pockets — specific attorneys or practice areas — that really get it. But so far it hasn’t been scalable. We need to change the DNA of the law firm and that’s what I’m trying to do here at Baker.”


David Cambria

The gamble, of course, is whether he can make it work. Baker McKenzie is almost 70 years old and has almost 5,000 lawyers. It’s not exactly a nimble startup. And unlike at a law department, firms are not managed hierarchically. It might be difficult for in-house counsel to go against the express wishes of the general counsel (and their hand-picked LDO). Law firm partners do it all the time. So will it work?

“I’ve been asking myself that question a lot. But my discussions with Baker happened over a long period of time and they showed themselves to be willing to really embrace legal ops. They already have a service center in Belfast for more routine work and a growing legal project management function that’s gaining traction with clients. There had already been a lot of innovation and they had already implemented a lot of new different technology. And last year, they elected a managing partner in North America who ran on a platform of building out the firm’s professional services to enable the firm to do more than just deliver legal advice. I feel really optimistic because the indicators are in place.”

A dozen years ago, David and I sat in a hotel restaurant and he said the same thing about law department operations. Can he roll another 7 or 11? I wouldn’t bet against it.

# Visionary Leadership In Times Of Change
## Seven ways you can set your team up for success.

The true measure of an effective legal operations leader with staying power is how she pivots away from traditional management and toward a new vision for the industry. The key to this transformation lies in recognizing this unique moment and seizing its potential.

Visionary leaders stand out by staying ahead of the curve, identifying opportunities that remain invisible to others, and maintaining clarity in the face of uncertainty. They are strategic thinkers who can execute pragmatically, balancing long-term vision with the demands of daily operations. For example, visionary leaders do not follow the generic trend regarding generative artificial intelligence. Instead, they create custom use cases and learn how to implement them to improve client satisfaction and operational efficiency. 

While it’s clear that visionary leaders possess many unique attributes, achieving this type of leadership in practice is not easy. A key part of the equation is learning to manage your organization’s day-to-day operations and the need for innovation simultaneously. As Ferring Pharmaceutical’s Chief Legal Officer, Curt McDaniel, would say, “It’s a blend of reaching for the stars and working step by step to get there.” This requires a transformative, multi-pronged strategy that leaves a lasting impact on the organization.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In addition, all great leaders have support in their shared vision. Regarding Legal Ops leadership, the support of the Chief Legal Officer and the General Counsel is essential. The CLO/GC should be a united front with the head of Legal Ops and help to define the path forward. Since Legal is at the front line of change and addresses the challenges and resistance accompanying change, support from the top is essential to help clear the way. 

Even great leaders with support from the top can find this process challenging, so here are a few more ways to set your teams up for success. 

- Cultivate a Culture of Innovation. Innovation is not a solo endeavor, as it thrives in the fertile soil of collaboration and open dialogue. Engage your team in robust discussions, even if it means challenging the status quo. One way to encourage this is to hold regular ‘Innovation Labs,’ where team members of all levels brainstorm solutions to operational challenges, with the best ideas recognized and rewarded.
- Start With The Why. When the CLO/GC clearly articulates the need behind proposed changes compellingly, it eases worry and avoids unnecessary distractions later in the process. Define the needed services and approach the process as if you are running a business (because you are!). Ask questions upfront and address concerns. This open dialogue helps reduce fear and hesitation as you begin. Come back to The Why throughout the process to remind teams of the ultimate goal.
- Embrace Risk in a Risk-Averse Field. There is no innovation without risk, yet the legal domain remains cautious. Create an environment where calculated risk-taking is supported and celebrated. Celebrate the team members who dare to think differently and are willing to test new waters.
- Anticipate Resistance With Proactive Change Management. Effective change management anticipates and addresses resistance head-on. Develop strategies to navigate potential obstacles and ensure smooth transitions. A proactive stance on change management prepares the organization for the expected and unforeseen, maintaining agility and resilience.
- Enable Agility Through Clear Communication and Training. Clarity in communication is paramount. Articulate the vision and the rationale for changes clearly, ensuring alignment across the organization. Complement this with robust training programs that prepare your team for new systems and processes. This dual approach fosters adaptability and ensures everyone can handle the changes ahead.
- Bring the Team on the Journey Together. It’s essential to bring the team along with you on this journey of change, starting with meeting them where they are. Talk, listen, and demonstrate that concerns are heard. Involve your people in the change process so they have ownership of it. Change affects everyone in different ways, so by going through this process, you will understand their worldview and how the change affects them personally. From there, you can show individuals how they will benefit from a new approach, and they have the opportunity to embrace and share this vision, too.
- Lead by Example. As a leader, your actions set the tone for the organization, and leading by example is key. Demonstrate your commitment to innovation and change to inspire your team to follow suit. Be the first to embrace new tools and methodologies and hold yourself accountable for desired changes.

# Lawyers Should Make It Easier For Clients To Pay Them
## Run-of-the-mill clients may face more challenges paying on time if the law firm only allows clients to pay by check.

I basically had to start from scratch when establishing billing practices after I launched my own practice, and I learned quickly which methods worked best to ensure that clients paid their invoices on time. One of the most important facts that I discovered about the collections process is that the easier it is for clients to pay, the more likely it is that the lawyer will be timely paid. Although that may seem self-evident, many lawyers allow clients to pay legal fees in only one or two burdensome ways, and that can impact how quickly bills are paid.

I retained a few lawyers in the past for various legal matters that I needed help with in my life. These lawyers worked at small shops, and most law firms that handle real estate closings, traffic tickets, and other matters during which individuals need to engage counsel are smaller operations. Every time I retained a lawyer in my personal life, the only way I could pay them was to mail a check to their office.

This presented problems. Before I operated my own law practice, I did not mail anything on a regular basis and, thus, rarely had stamps. Moreover, I also inconsistently had checks. I pay for pretty much everything online, and I used one checkbook for almost a decade. When I ran out of checks, it took me a very long time to order new ones because I did not really need them.

As a result, I was not the best client when it came time to pay my lawyer. It took me time to get my act together to secure the stamps and checks to pay my attorney, since there was no way that I could pay my lawyer in a quicker fashion. As a lawyer myself, I understand how important it is to pay lawyers (and others) on time, and I couldn’t help but think that run-of-the-mill clients would face more challenges paying on time if the law firm only allowed clients to pay by check.

When I started my own law firm, I resolved that I would make it as easy as possible for clients to pay their bills. My firm offers clients several ways to send payments. Clients can drop a check in the mail for us, and some of our clients do this on a regular basis. However, most of our clients pay their bills by credit card. Our invoices have a link and a QR code that let clients pay their invoices by credit card in just a few clicks. Clients who have their credit card information saved on their computers might only require a few seconds to pay their bills. Usually, the bills that are paid soon after they are issued are the ones paid by credit card since clients can easily take care of the invoices.

Credit card companies charge relatively high fees, which my firm eats for the sake of convenience to the client. Sometimes, if clients are paying a larger bill, we wish that the bills would not be paid by credit card since credit card fees may take away hundreds of dollars that would otherwise end up in our pockets. However, the convenience more than makes up for it. Some of our more savvy clients pay by bank transfer, which is also preferable, since this usually does not come with the same amount of fees as credit cards.

In any case, providing convenient payment methods will not solve all of a firm’s problems when it comes to collections from clients. However, the easier law firms make it for clients to pay them, the more likely it is clients will pay their bills as soon as possible.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Above The Law 'Celebrities': Where Are They Now?

Last month, Above the Law celebrated its [tenth anniversary](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/above-the-law-turns-ten-today-atl-celebrities-where-are-they-now/). You are all invited to our birthday party next week (details and RSVP [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/above-the-laws-10th-anniversary-party-youre-invited/)).

We are marking our tenth anniversary with [“10 for 10,”](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/atl-10-for-10/) a series of ten articles looking at how lawyers, the legal profession, and Above the Law have evolved over the past decade. In this story, which we previously [requested nominees for](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/above-the-law-turns-ten-today-atl-celebrities-where-are-they-now/), we will update you on the current whereabouts of ten ATL “celebrities” — the judges, lawyers, and law students featured in our biggest stories over the years. Think of it as the ATL version of that dearly departed VH1 show, [“Where Are They Now?”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Are_They_Now%3F_(U.S._TV_series))

Before we plunge into the list, a few caveats:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
1. This list is admittedly idiosyncratic. People have strong views of who is or should be a “celebrity,” as well as whether they love or hate a particular celeb. We didn’t take a very formal approach to selecting these individuals. We started off by reviewing our biggest posts of all time, ranked by pageviews, and pulled some stars from those stories. But then we mixed in a few other figures who might not have appeared in a chart-topping individual story but served as recurring subjects of coverage.

2. This list excludes anonymous/pseudonymous people. It’s hard to determine what someone is up to when you don’t know their true identity. So you won’t see appearances here from Loyola 2L, our [2007 Lawyer of the Year](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/01/featured-survey-results-and-the-winners-are------/); Partner Emeritus, one of our most famous (or infamous) commenters, before we [removed comments](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-farewell-to-comments/); or “Ms. X,” the Biglaw mother with a [notoriously demanding schedule](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/11/departure-memo-of-the-day-parenting-gets-the-best-of-one-biglaw-associate/).

3. This list focuses on people who have at least somewhat interesting story arcs. There’s a reason you won’t see any of our Lawyer of the Year winners on this list. If you look up the past [LOTY honorees](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/above-the-laws-2015-lawyer-of-the-year-contest-the-winner/), you’ll see that almost all are doing what they were doing at the time that we honored them.

4. This list might contain errors or omissions. We tried our best to track people down, but we didn’t go to the ends of the earth (or even hire a [private investigator](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/the-art-of-fact-investigation-an-interview-with-philip-segal/)), so some of the information below might be incorrect or incomplete. But we will rely upon a method that has stood Above the Law in good stead over the past decade: crowdsourcing. If you have an addition or correction to any of the info below, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Where%20Are%20They%20Now) or text us (646-820-8477), including the words “where are they now” somewhere in your message. We will then update accordingly.

And now, on to our ten celebrities — actually more than ten, because we have some couples — and where they are now. We present them in no particular order.

1. [Judge Wade McCree](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/judge-wade-mccree/). We have covered many judicial scandals over the years, but this [2014 story about then-Judge McCree](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/shirtless-wade-mccree-may-be-heading-to-the-supreme-court/) is the most widely read of them all (thanks in large part to a link from the [Drudge Report](http://drudgereport.com/)). You might recall McCree for his penchant for posing for shirtless selfies, or the affair he was having with the complaining witness in a felony child support case that was before him.

What’s the latest on Wade McCree? He’s no longer “Judge” McCree; the Michigan Supreme Court tossed him from office in 2014. He’s not even a practicing lawyer; in February of this year, the State of Michigan Attorney Discipline Board [suspended his law license](http://www.law360.com/articles/753195/ex-judge-s-law-license-suspended-for-affair-with-litigant) for two years. But let’s look on the bright side: the Sixth Circuit held that the doctrine of judicial immunity protected McCree from a suit filed by the father in that child support case, and last year the Supreme Court [denied certiorari](http://www.law360.com/articles/615017). Congratulations?

2. [Justice Lori Douglas](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/lori-douglas/). Justice Douglas is the retired Canadian jurist who became an international news story — and one of our [most-read posts](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/judge-whose-nude-photos-got-posted-online-breaks-her-silence/) — after pornographic photos of her became public. It was covered as a scandal, and investigated as one too — to the tune of more than [$3 million](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/judge-whose-nude-photos-got-posted-online-breaks-her-silence/) in taxpayer money.

But with the benefit of hindsight, I’d say this is a story that we (and many others) got wrong, at least in our initial, breathless coverage. We later learned that Justice Douglas was more victim than vixen: it turned out that her (now deceased) husband, Jack King, shared the photos with others without Justice Douglas’s knowledge or consent.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The good news is that Justice Douglas made it through this controversy and is doing [just fine today](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/judge-whose-nude-photos-got-posted-online-breaks-her-silence/?rf=1). The ethics investigation concluded with a settlement that ended the inquiry and allowed her to resign from the bench in May 2015 — an important date, because it allowed her to receive retirement benefits based on 10 years of judicial service.

Douglas is now back to practicing family law and hoping to do some teaching too. As she told the [Canadian Lawyer](http://www.canadianlawyermag.com/5876/Behind-the-headlines.html) earlier this year, “I feel fine. I haven’t been so well now for five years.”

3. [Reema Bajaj](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/reema-bajaj/). Sticking to the subject of “lawyers and sex,” this Illinois attorney made headlines after she was accused of moonlighting as a prostitute. In June 2012, she [pleaded guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/06/down-goes-bajaj-reema-pleads-guilty-to-prostitution/) to a misdemeanor charge of prostitution. As of December 2013, she was working in an office in a managerial capacity and “moving on with her life,” as her lawyer [put it](http://www.daily-chronicle.com/2013/12/31/attorney-accused-of-prostitution-drops-lawsuit-over-nude-photos/abusj/).

In March 2014, Bajaj was [suspended from the practice of law](https://www.iardc.org/ldetail.asp?id=927701632) for three years and until further order of the Illinois Supreme Court. But March 2017 is just around the corner. Might the legal profession see a return of Reema? I hope that she’s allowed to return to practice (if she so desires); everyone deserves a second chance.

4. [Stephanie Grace](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/stephanie-grace/). This very bright young lawyer, a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law School, generated nationwide controversy after an [unfortunate email of hers](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/04/hls-3ls-racist-email-goes-national/) that [some saw as racist](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/04/harvard-blsa-racism-banality-evil/) got dug up and disseminated (possibly by a [friend turned enemy](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/05/the-harvard-email-controversy-how-it-all-began/)).

Fortunately for Grace, some impressive employers looked past the controversy. Grace clerked for one of the most highly regarded judges in the country, Judge Alex Kozinski of the Ninth Circuit, and today works for [Latham & Watkins in San Diego](https://www.lw.com/people/StephanieNGrace), where she handles complex litigation (plus pro bono work too).

5. [Johnathan Perkins](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/johnathan-perkins/). This is another race-related story, but of a very different type. While he was a student at UVA Law School, Perkins admitted to [fabricating a story](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/05/a-law-student-plays-the-race-card-and-gets-busted-big-time/) about being harassed by UVA police on account of his race (he is African-American). His justification: “I wrote the article to bring attention to the topic of police misconduct.”

(Please don’t misconstrue this as a defense of his (clearly unacceptable) actions, but let me toss something out there: in the wake of Black Lives Matter movement and the widespread mistreatment of African-Americans by police that it has highlighted, doesn’t Perkins seem oddly prescient?)

Furious fellow UVA students argued that Perkins [shouldn’t be allowed to graduate](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/05/a-law-student-plays-the-race-card-and-gets-busted-big-time/), citing UVA’s strict honor code. But a jury of his peers acquitted him in those proceedings, and he did [receive his law degree](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/01/an-update-on-johnathan-perkins-did-he-get-his-law-degree/).

Like Stephanie Grace, Johnathan Perkins has been able to put the unpleasantness behind him and enjoy a successful legal career. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar and today is an associate in the [Philadelphia office of Montgomery McCracken](http://www.mmwr.com/attorney/johnathan-s-perkins/). He has taken lemons and made lemonade: he focuses on “representing universities and corporations with respect to claims of discrimination,” and he lists “higher education” as one of his practice areas as well.

UPDATE (10/3/2017): We now know much more about what happened to Johnathan Perkins back in 2011 than we did at the time, and it majorly changes how he and the situation should be viewed. See this new story, [Was UVA Law Alum Johnathan Perkins Pressured By The FBI Into Recanting His Account Of Racial Profiling?](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/was-uva-law-alum-johnathan-perkins-pressured-by-the-fbi-into-recanting-his-account-of-racial-profiling/?rf=1)

# Flexibility Is A Two-Way Street When It Comes To This Biglaw Firm's Reopening Plans
## The firm's managing partner has no plans to micromanage anyone's schedule.

When it comes to reopening plans in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it looks like the majority of Biglaw firms are going with a phased-in approach to their return to the office. Flexibility remains a priority at most firms, and the only thing up in the air is the number of days employees will have to be physically present in the office. Now that a bit of uniformity seems to have been established in the market, let’s check in with another firm to see what they’ve got planned.

Arent Fox — ranked No. 107 in the most recent Am Law 200, with a 2020 gross revenue of $333,600,000 — recently announced its own phased-in return to the office. “The goal is for Arent Fox to be fully open as of September—after Labor Day,” said managing partner Cristina Carvalho in an interview with the American Lawyer. On July 6, all of the firm’s U.S offices will be open, and according to Carvalho, employees will likely come in once a week, and eventually, work their way up to coming in twice a week. While it’s expected that all personnel will maintain a “routine physical presence” in the office when the firm has fully reopened, flexibility is still on the table.

Carvalho said Arent Fox isn’t planning to define for staff and lawyers how many days they must spend in the office. Instead, she is confident that colleagues will find a mix that suits them, both personally and professionally.

“It’s not my intention to micromanage and say which day people are going to be in the office. Ultimately, we all understand what we need to do and, ultimately, we’re all here in the business of servicing our clients. Everybody at the firm has good judgment. And everyone will keep that ultimate goal in mind,” said Carvalho, who added that some staff and practice areas with responsibilities will likely find they need to spend more time in the office, but that the decision will be left to the individual and their managers.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Calvalho noted that flexibility must be a two-way street. “The firm will provide for a flexible schedule for everyone but, lawyers and the staff should also be flexible,” she said. “Sometimes there’s emergency situations or impromptu meetings or client demands where colleagues might need to make unscheduled trips in. That’s the nature of the business.”

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Hint: Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said, “Many states have conflicting and overlapping abortion bans that make it nearly impossible to know what is legal and what is not. People are worried they may be prosecuted even for helping someone find abortion services across state lines. This initiative brings together some of the best lawyers in the country to provide legal advice, as well as criminal and civil defense.”

It’s been almost three weeks since Freshfields became the first Magic Circle firm to [join the latest round of special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/freshfields-special-bonus-2021/). But with Allen & Overy joining the bunch yesterday, associates are noting “a little late to the game but better late than never!”

Indeed, [you could have gotten a hat](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firm-says-youre-expecting-a-bonus-but-please-accept-this-hat-instead/).

So what we have here is a backloaded June and “Fall” bonus.

What does “Fall” mean? It’s unclear. June isn’t exactly crystal clear either, with the memo only saying that the firm anticipates bonuses will be paid by June 30. For a firm that’s had three weeks to consider what its peers are doing, you’d think they’d have worked out more of the logistical kinks.

In any event, welcome news.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Louis Lehot

A third woman has come [forward to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ](http://www.wigdorlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Letter-from-L.-Christensen-to-EEOC-10.23.19.pdf)with allegations about the inappropriate behavior of former DLA Piper partner Louis Lehot.[ Leah M. Christensen](https://www.sandiego.edu/law/faculty/biography.php?profile_id=7037), a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law and former Professional Responsibility Counsel within the firm’s Office of General Counsel, claims Lehot acted like a “textbook bully” and was allowed to get away with it because of the size of his book of business, saying:

Lehot is a textbook bully. There is simply no other way to describe him. He bulldozed his way through DLA Piper like a tank, rolling over anything or anyone in his way. In order to get his way, Lehot yelled, threatened, intimidated and terrorized people around him. I know because I was one of the people around him.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
She also says that when, in the course of her work, she spoke with Lehot about his interpretation of an ethics rule, he lashed out calling her a “dumb bitch”:

For example, one time when I told Lehot that he was not following the ethics rules, in front of other DLA staff, Lehot called me a “dumb bitch.” I reported Lehot’s abusive conduct and “loose” interpretation of the ethics rules during our weekly department meetings to my boss, Peter Lindau, Assistant General Counsel, and to Joe Davis, Associate General Counsel. Nothing was done.

The allegations against Lehot are starting to pile up. Earlier this month, DLA Piper partner Vanina Guerrero [alleged that Lehot repeatedly sexually assaulted her.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-fellow-partner/) She asked the firm to release her from their mandatory arbitration agreement so she can pursue her claims in court. The firm has been conspicuously silent on the forced arbitration agreement — despite the [attention their arbitration stance](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/kamala-harris-gets-dragged-into-dla-piper-sexual-assault-controversy/) in this case [has garnered](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/law-school-students-protest-outside-of-dla-piper-over-alleged-sexual-assault/), but, they did announce that Lehot had been [let go from the firm.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-out-amid-sexual-assault-allegations/) But the firm also put Guerrero on [administrative leave](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/now-the-dla-piper-accuser-has-been-put-on-leave/), saying they’d uncovered allegations against her unrelated to Lehot during their investigation of her claims. Lehot[ released a statement](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-accused-of-sexual-assault-speaks-out/) contesting the allegations against him and saying Guerrero was “exploiting” the #MeToo movement. Then a second woman, an anonymous HR manager, came forward with her own allegations against Lehot,[ saying he made her “physically afraid,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/second-woman-accuses-former-dla-piper-partner-of-inappropriate-behavior/?rf=1) and further alleging the firm let her go when she complained about Lehot.

As part of Christensen’s letter to the EEOC, she also says she’s been contacted by other women at the firm who’ve had similar experiences with Lehot but are “too scared” to come forward.

# More Plaintiffs Added To Astonishing Pregnancy And Gender Discrimination Case Against MoFo
## A spokesperson for the firm calls the allegations 'inconsistent' with the firm's values.

Back in April, three women sued Biglaw giant Morrison & Foerster in[ a $100 million class-action case claiming the firm engaged in gender discrimination](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/mofo-hit-with-100-million-pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1) against women who are pregnant or have children. The action was initiated by three Jane Doe attorneys at the firm who said when they took maternity leave they were placed on a “mommy track” from which their careers couldn’t recover. Last week, Sanford Heisler Sharp, attorneys for the plaintiffs, filed an amended complaint, adding three more Jane Doe plaintiffs to the complaint.

According to the amended complaint, in stark contrast to its reputation (MoFo was named a [Top 10 Female Friendly Firm by Yale Law Women in 2018](https://biglawbusiness.com/yale-law-women-names-top-10-female-friendly-firms)), taking maternity leave is a “dead end” for women’s careers at the firm:

At MoFo, the mommy track is a dead end. Not only are pregnant attorneys and mothers routinely prevented from advancing with their class years, but the Firm forces women who are or could be mothers to work harder to prove that they are dedicated to their positions and to the Firm, setting unreasonably high expectations for them. Those who avail themselves of the Firm’s maternity leave or flexible work schedule policy (voluntarily or involuntarily) — which permits attorneys to work part-time to care for their newborn children, purportedly without fear of repercussions for their career — are particularly vulnerable. Adding insult to injury, women are often denied even the chance to meet these expectations when they return from maternity leave and find themselves without sufficient work to meet the billable hour expectations set by the Firm.

The complaint goes on to detail specifics for each of the plaintiffs, including one, Jane Doe 5, who was named a “Pro Bono All-Star” by the firm prior to her maternity leave. After she came back to the firm, the complaint alleges all that changed:

Upon returning from leave, Jane Doe 5 learned that she had not been promoted with her peers, nor had she received the corresponding salary and bonus increase that should have accompanied her anticipated promotion. Prior to that, Jane Doe 5’s supervisors had given her no indication or notice that the Firm would not progress her. Jane Doe 5 had no history of performance issues nor had she ever been held back previously during her time at MoFo.

The amended complaint goes on to allege that despite being encouraged to take a flexible schedule in the months after returning from leave, Jane Doe 5 was fired six months after she returned from maternity leave. According to the filing, the partners who communicated the termination were unable to cite specific examples where her performance was lacking. The treatment of Jane Doe 5 — as well as the other Jane Doe plaintiffs — is being called “troubling” by their attorney, Aimee Krause Stewart:

“The material inequities for pregnant women and mothers that the Complaint lays out are bad enough,” said Aimee Krause Stewart, “but the gaslighting, humiliation and impossible choices our plaintiffs describe are even more troubling.”

A spokesperson for the firm refuted the allegations in the amended complaint, and called them “inconsistent” with the firm’s values:

The allegations about our firm in the amended complaint are not true. They are inconsistent with the facts, and our values, policies, and practices. We have fully investigated these claims and they are without foundation. We will vigorously defend our longstanding record of supporting and promoting women and parents.

We have been broadly recognized for our leadership in providing greater opportunity for women lawyers, including being named one of the top family-friendly and women-friendly firms by Yale Law Women and as a “Ceiling Crasher” by Law360, and we exceed the national average in every leadership metric included in Working Mother’s “Best Law Firms for Women” list. Our Firm’s commitment to – and track record on – diversity and inclusion remains one of our proudest achievements and greatest priorities.

Karl Harris

Data has forever changed the way the legal industry approaches and practices law. In the area of litigation, Lex Machina’s Legal Analytics platform has fundamentally altered the landscape of how lawyers build strategies and make case decisions, and they’re continuing to make their invaluable tools and unrivaled insights even better.

We recently sat down with Karl Harris, CEO of Lex Machina, to discuss some of the latest additions and enhancements to its powerful Legal Analytics platform, including Appellate Analytics, State Motion Metrics, and the Legal Analytics API. 

What is Appellate Analytics and why was it created?

Appellate Analytics gives users the ability to make data-driven decisions around cases that ultimately end up on appeal and about those appeals themselves. It shows how a judge is likely to behave in a certain scenario. Is a particular district court judge likely to be appealed and, if so, what’s likely to happen on that appeal? It’s about seeing the litigation lifespan of a federal district court case. It completes the story of the district court cases on our Legal Analytics platform.

Since we started Lex Machina in 2012, customers have been asking for analytics on appeals. Adding Appellate Analytics is the culmination of a journey for us and gets us to where we wanted to be for almost 10 years now. Our mission is to bring Legal Analytics to all areas of law. We got there in federal district court, and now we’re able to put the appellate umbrella on top of everything.

Why is Lex Machina so uniquely well-suited to tackle appellate cases?

Lex Machina is a unique solution in that we have what we call outcome-based litigation analytics – the ability to answer all questions about case resolution, damages, findings, and more is exclusive to Lex Machina. Being able to say what happened on appeal with those cases is central to really determining what happened in federal district court. Given that we’re the only solution that has the data to determine those outcomes for federal district court, we’re naturally positioned to be the only solution that can say what happened to those cases on appeal. It’s the same outcome-based analytics at work.

How does Appellate Analytics fit into the bigger picture of the Legal Analytics platform?

One of the things we’re really excited about is that, if you know how to use Lex Machina, then you already know how to use Appellate Analytics. It’s the same user interface. We have unique data for appeals, but it’s the same tool. It just extends the story all the way to cases on appeal and completes it.

What is State Motion Metrics and why was it created?

State Motion Metrics focuses on what happens when a state court judge issues an order related to a motion. It covers outcomes for 37 different kinds of motions in state court. Again, on the theme of completing the story, State Motion Metrics goes beyond just telling the outcomes for state court cases that go to trial and also includes outcome information on cases that were disposed of on motion practice, which is very common. It allows us to extend the outcome-oriented story of litigation in state court to those cases that didn’t necessarily end up at trial and to tell the full story of how the cases that did go to trial got there.

It allows you to see judges’ track records on various kinds of motions. When you have a sense of how your judge is likely to rule on a particular type of motion, you can make better decisions for your client on what motions to file and what pitfalls to avoid.

What is the technology behind State Motion Metrics and why is it important?

State Motion Metrics is built around a machine learning-based neural network using the actual orders themselves. State courts use different docketing systems and the docket entry text cannot always give the full picture of what is going on. Often, you can only figure out what happens on a motion by actually reading the order that relates to that particular motion. We built a whole new system that goes through and processes those full documents to figure out what type of motion it was and what happened. With millions of state court cases each year, and often multiple motions within each case, it’s impossible to manually analyze motion outcomes and create a big picture understanding. This allows practitioners access to a whole new category of information that was simply not available in aggregate before.

Lex Machina is very well situated to build such a model, because we have a team of legally trained data experts who can review and code hundreds of motions. After they do that, we can run our neural network on that coding to figure out the relevant factors necessary to determine the outcome from an order, and then run that analysis over millions of documents. We’ve gotten great feedback and lots of excitement from our clients so far.

How has Lex Machina been expanding its state court coverage?

We’re constantly expanding our coverage and rolling out new state courts at a rate of about 12 a year. We first focused on state courts in large commercial centers, like Los Angeles, Atlanta, and New York, and certain counties in major cities, like Harris County in Houston. We have 27 state courts within Lex Machina so far, and we’re continuing to roll out more as we complete the first group. Being acquired by LexisNexis gave us access to all the state data they built up over decades, which will allow us to add more courts at scale.

Can you briefly explain what an API is for those who might not be fully familiar with the concept?

An API allows people to use our data outside of our products, in their own way, through any programming interface they choose. So, for example, it used to be that the only way to access Lex Machina data was to log in to lexmachina.com and use the platform. Over the last five years or so, there’s been a significant acceleration among law firms wanting to make sense of various external data sources in combination with their own internal data. An API makes that possible.

In the case of Lex Machina, users can access our data through our API and integrate it into internal products or internal use cases to mix and match data and make the best of both worlds. The API allows users to access our data wherever they want, outside of our product. 

Why did Lex Machina implement an API for Legal Analytics?

It was in response to our customers asking for the ability to combine our data with other external and internal data sources. Firms and companies are employing more software developers, and the need for an API to help them build their desired tools had hit an inflection point. In certain instances, it also allows companies to export our data and match it up with their internal data.

The API will be able to pull in data from Appellate Analytics very soon. The short-term goal for the API is to cover an increasingly high percentage of all Lex Machina data, so that anything you can do in the product, you can get through the API.

What are some common use cases for your API?

A very common use case for law firms is to have an internal dashboard or other internal tool where attorneys can look up information for a specific judge, for example. The internal page will house all the information the firm knows about that judge from both their internal tracking and experience and the information from Lex Machina.

Another use case is client intake and business development. A firm can consolidate all the information about particular clients, including cases that client had before the firm started representing them and what work they have that the firm isn’t handling. The same information can be pulled in for prospective clients. Using Lex Machina’s API to match our data up with their internal data helps them make data-driven, strategic decisions.

What else can we expect in the future from Lex Machina?

As I mentioned, we want to continue expanding our state court coverage across the U.S. Down the road, we’d also like to potentially expand into international litigation analytics as data becomes more and more available in certain international jurisdictions. 

There’s also the expansion of the API, which is what we’re calling “put Lex Machina everywhere.” Just as companies are interested in mixing and matching our data with their data, we’re interested in being able to do that as well. One of the things that’s nice about being part of LexisNexis is that we have all kinds of different products to pull from. We’d like to be able to add all that information to the litigation record to power even more strategic decision-making.

The acceleration of the legal profession in being more data-driven over the past decade has been exciting, and we want to keep developing new tools and features that push that forward.

— [Susan Hackett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susanhackett/), CEO of Legal Executive Leadership and former general counsel of the Association of Corporate Counsel, commenting on the fact that [in-house gripes](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/19/lets-stay-together-clients-angry-about-associate-raises-but-will-probably-keep-firms-anyway/) about this summer’s Biglaw salary increases aren’t likely to inspire a changing of the guard in outside counsel for most corporate clients.

# Lessons For Success From A Former Biglaw Associate
## Internalize these lessons early in your career, and you'll be set for life.

Abby Gordon

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on lateral associate and partner moves from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Abby Gordon](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/team/abby-gordon/) is a Senior Director with Lateral Link’s New York office. Abby works with attorney candidates on law firm and in-house searches, primarily in New York, Boston, and Europe. Prior to joining Lateral Link, Abby spent seven years as a corporate associate with [Cleary Gottlieb](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cleary-gottlieb/), focusing on capital markets transactions for Latin American clients in New York and for the last five years for European clients in Paris. A native of Boston, Abby holds a J.D., cum laude, from Georgetown University Law Center and a B.A. in government and romance languages, magna cum laude, from Dartmouth College. Abby also worked with the International Rescue Committee as a Fulbright Scholar in Madrid, Spain. She is a member of the New York Bar and is fluent in French and Spanish (and dabbles in Portuguese and Italian).

In my 7+ years in Biglaw and now 6+ years as a legal recruiter, assisting others with career planning, I have learned certain lessons I wish we’d all internalize early in our careers:

Ask questions at the start. Ask questions to clarify the substance of your assignments and questions relating to logistical and practical matters. One question that is always appropriate is, “When do you need this by?” Trust me, you’ll wish you’d asked.

Notwithstanding Lesson #1, ask yourself every question first. An essential quality of a great associate is developing the judgment to know when this is something you can figure out on your own and when this requires input from someone more senior. Be respectful of senior lawyers’ time (which is also clients’ money). Learning to problem-solve and to be resourceful is a crucial skill as a lawyer. Even the most mundane tasks are learning experiences in disguise.

Be responsive and efficient but pause before you respond. Take an extra minute to breath, think, polish, and proofread your response.

Appreciate that no job is too menial. Do you feel that many of your assignments are beneath you? That a well-trained monkey could complete them? Well, there’s a method to the madness. You need to live in the weeds — often for a long time — before you can design the perfect garden.

Ask yourself what is the bigger picture. Your day-to-day tasks might be tedious and you may be overworked and exhausted but you must always make time to ask how your task relates to the big picture. This is how you develop as a lawyer: by doing the grunt work carefully and meticulously while studying and conceptualizing the work of your whole team.

Pay attention to detail. Re-read, re-read, re-read backwards. You are being paid the big bucks to complete menial tasks because the partners and the clients trust that you will do them right. You must catch the typos, even at 2:00 a.m. The simpler the task, the more important it is to avoid cutting corners and avoid mistakes.

Recognize that organization, meeting deadlines, and a positive attitude count for at least 50 percent. Even if you’re not the best lawyer out there, attention to detail plus meeting deadlines — all with a smile on your face — will go a long, long way to keeping you employed.

Treat junior lawyers and administrative staff — and everyone else for that matter — with just as much respect as you treat the partners. The positive attitude in Lesson #7 should not be reserved solely for your superiors. Be kind to everyone, as it will smooth the road for you going forward. And moreover, because it’s the right thing to do.

Don’t trust blindly and assume the firm will “do the right thing.” You may feel as though you’re a valued member of a big, happy family, but ultimately law firms are businesses. Be smart and protect yourself. It’s not appropriate to email me (a recruiter) via work email regarding your job search. And a lesson I learned the hard way: do not give notice of your departure before your year-end bonus hits your account.

Appreciate constructive feedback. Don’t get defensive. Your seniors get annoyed, and worse, they will stop giving you feedback. Then how will you grow? How can you properly assess your prospects for advancement?

Develop authentic relationships with partners. Seek out mentors. You need someone who’ll go to bat for you. Failure to seek out and nurture a relationship with an influential partner sponsor is one of the most common mistakes that stop otherwise qualified associates from making partner.

Develop a business plan. See [my 2017 article](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/why-lawyers-need-to-have-business-plans-no-matter-what/) on why lawyers need business plans, whether you’re looking to move firms or not. And maintain an always-ready, updated resume and representative matters sheet.

Accept that you and only you are in charge of your professional development. Don’t assume law schools or law firm partners are looking out for your career development. Your interests may not always be aligned with the firm’s interests. Partners are busy. Be proactive and ask for specific guidance. Write down your career goals and how you plan to achieve them. This career plan is for your eyes only; it should be the result of honest and thoughtful introspection and self-assessment. Schedule weekly check-ins with yourself to take stock of your professional development needs and goals.

Keep your options open. Work towards your goals but be open to changing them or the path to reaching them. Be open to considering new opportunities. Constantly assess and reassess your options. If you never change jobs, make it an affirmative decision to stay put. If your career goals stay constant, affirmatively choose them again and again.

Practice authentic networking. Keep your LinkedIn profile up-to-date and connect systematically and in a timely manner with people you meet. Network to learn from others and to open your horizons. Don’t save building a network for when you’re desperate for a new job.

Recognize that career planning is a continuous and thoughtful process and not a one-and-done crisis management tool. Don’t be complacent. Be proactive. Maintain an ongoing dialogue with a recruiter you trust. Remember that Career Services is for alums and not just current students. Calendar regular appointments with yourself to check in and ask if you’re doing everything you can do to 1) be the best lawyer you can be, and 2) be the happiest lawyer you can be.

Believe in yourself. Develop and continuously re-evaluate your own definition of success and metrics for measuring it, in line with your personal goals and values. Appreciate constructive feedback but do not let how others view your legal skills define your worth as a human being.

I’d love to hear about your career turning points and insights from your years of practice. Please email me at [agordon@lateralink.com](mailto:agordon@lateralink.com) and share with me what would be on your list of lessons learned!

# First Major Biglaw Firm Matches The 2021 Cravath Bonus Scale
## It's bonus time at this leading law firm!

[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/) officially kicked off the 2021 bonus season yesterday afternoon, finally sweetening the pot by increasing its annual bonus offerings by up to 15% per class year. Now, another elite law firm has jumped to match the market rate as quickly as possible.

Which firm is the first to match the official 2021 Biglaw bonus scale?

Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton is the first firm to hop on the Cravath bonus bandwagon. The firm is usually the first or second to match year-end bonuses, and 2021 is no different. Bonuses at the firm will be paid to all associates in good standing on December 22.

Here’s the bonus scale, in case you’ve forgotten what it looks like:

- Class of 2021: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2020: $20,000
- Class of 2019: $30,000
- Class of 2018: $57,500

Congratulations to Cleary associates on the generous bonuses!

(Does this mean that associates’ hopes for another firm to step in and raise the bonus scale even higher will be dashed? That’s uncertain, but we’ll be watching.)

When you’ve had an especially tough year in Biglaw — billing hours like crazy — it’s nice when the firm rewards your efforts with a little something extra in your stocking at the end of the year. Or in the case of Katten Muchin Rosenman, a big something extra — provided you billed enough.

The firm, which took in $713,854,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 68th on the Am Law 100, announced their year-end bonuses today. At 2000 hours, associates will make the same as the prevailing market rate, and it goes up from there, depending on just how busy you’ve been.

The bonus grid at the firm is as follows:



In addition to these elevated bonuses for high billers, there are additional “superstar” bonuses at the firm for well, superstars. Bonuses will be paid on February 1st. You can read the full memo on [the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/katten-bonus-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Biglaw Firms Want Associate Butts In Office Seats -- And The Same Goes For Partners
## Like it or not, remote work seems to be on the way out in Biglaw.

What I’m hearing from law firms — a real frustration is that law firm leaders do want people back in the office, and they want it for partners as well. I’m hearing by and large the partners are more on board than the associates. So in terms of the handful of partners we did place, in terms of positions, I think there will be even less [remote hires] because if firms are taking a slightly harder line with associates, they’re not going to want to hire someone [at the partner level] who doesn’t want to be in the office.

— [Lauren Drake](https://www.macrae.com/lauren-drake), a legal recruiter and partner at Macrae in Washington, D.C., in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/30/big-law-is-ramping-up-pressure-on-office-work-in-2023/), on Biglaw firms’ desire to have associates and partners working from within their physical offices as they step away from pandemic-era remote work proposals.

Things aren’t going great for Gordon Caplan. As you probably know, the onetime [co-managing partner at Willkie Farr](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/willkie-farr-ditches-gordon-caplan-nabbed-in-varsity-blues-scandal/) found himself[ caught in the “Varsity Blues”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/willkie-farr-chair-caught-in-college-admissions-scandal/) college admissions scandal, eventually [pleading guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/suspended-co-chair-of-biglaw-firm-charged-in-college-admissions-scandal-will-plead-guilty/) to paying $75,000 to “college coaches” turned government cooperating witnesses in a scheme to have a professional alter his daughter’s answers on the ACT in order to get her a higher score. He was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani to[ one month of jail time](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/disgraced-former-biglaw-chair-gets-jail-time-for-his-role-in-college-admissions-scandal/). Now he’s in a fight to keep his law license.

In New York, disbarment is automatic for conviction of a state felony or for a crime “essentially similar” to a state felony. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/11/07/gordon-caplan-gets-hearing-in-bid-to-avoid-disbarment-stemming-from-college-admissions-scandal/) Law.com, Caplan’s license has been suspended, but he’s trying to avoid the most severe punishment:

On Thursday, the Appellate Division, [First Department held](https://doc-14-3c-apps-viewer.googleusercontent.com/viewer/secure/pdf/flih8mf8m4cjf7g9rn8oa7761p62rapo/2pugqueuqdufhc2u3csmf6le7av36uvb/1573143300000/gmail/12009112358054182955/ACFrOgCDMXhio3sMQA8D5gSmvrh_Pvfm5pbCyGXv7zMdKFiM48abBgM39-mtv_1QCUHsyrs9FbXe_T0t2wHGjTScltXvaRIFlSUnqxR-yXfpi-v4UZ8ZDLV5O-nhyXg=?print=true&nonce=m6vh7bmklrhqu&user=12009112358054182955&hash=0nlf7n6r7tnf6t4obhnc153s9k3uimm2) that Caplan’s offense qualified as a “serious crime” that warranted immediate suspension, but also granted his request for a hearing as to “why a final order of censure, suspension or disbarment should not be made.”

As Caplan’s attorney, Michael Ross, noted:

“Mr. Caplan agreed to the interim suspension and looks forward to presenting all the facts to the court so that a fair and appropriate sanction can be imposed on him,” Ross said.

Earlier this week, Caplan reported to a low-security prison in Pennsylvania to begin serving his sentence. The ethics hearing will take place within 90 days of his release.

It’s not just corporate executives who have come forward to rebuke President Donald Trump for his commentary on the ugly Charlottesville rally that brought about violent clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters, eventually leading to numerous injuries and the death of [paralegal Heather Heyer](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/woman-killed-during-charlottesville-protest-was-a-paralegal/) — it’s leaders and prominent partners of some of the most trusted Biglaw firms in the business, too.

Since Saturday, several firms have spoken out against Trump’s remarks, denouncing the president for casting blame on both sides and making a moral equivalency between Nazis and those who opposed them. Thus far, those firms include Skadden Arps, Paul Weiss, Lowenstein Sandler, Wachtell Lipton, WilmerHale, Polsinelli, Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, Crowell & Moring, Latham & Watkins, Hogan Lovells, Akin Gump, and Greenberg Traurig.

Here is a [statement](https://www.skadden.com/about/news-and-rankings/news/2017/08/statement-on-recent-events) released by Skadden and published on its website:

We condemn the racism that took place in Charlottesville last weekend. Those actions were an affront to the fundamental principles of equality and justice that strengthen our nation.

Since its founding in 1948, one of Skadden’s core values has been our commitment to diversity and inclusion. Recognizing that our differences help make us better and stronger, Skadden will always be a safe and welcoming environment for individuals who exemplify and share those values.

We thought it important at this time to reaffirm our dedication to our values and, in particular, our diversity.

On Monday night, Paul Weiss chairman [Brad Karp](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/brad-s-karp) expressed similar sentiments in a firmwide email, noting that “[i]ntolerance and hate are anathema to our most fundamental ideals. There is no place in our society for expressions of bigotry and group supremacy. The events of this past weekend are abhorrent to everything our nation stands for and we must renew our pledge to support this nation’s core principles.” He concluded his missive by stating that the firm will “continue to fight for these basic principles and to ensure that the rights, dignities and freedoms of all our citizens are fully respected and vindicated.”

In another firmwide email, [Gary Wingens](https://www.lowenstein.com/gwingens/), chairman and managing partner of Lowenstein Sandler, told his colleagues about his mother, a concentration camp survivor, who would have been devastated by the events in Charlottesville:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Whether you are the descendant of immigrants who came to this country to escape persecution or to seek a better life, the descendant of slaves, a Native American or an immigrant yourself, we can all agree that the [U.S.] is at its best when we treat everyone with respect and dignity regardless of race, religion, nation of origin, gender or sexual orientation.

There is no place in this firm, our communities or this country for white supremacists or leaders who do not unequivocally name them and call them out. In the face of those who give voice to divisiveness and hate, please join me in re-doubling our efforts to create an even more inclusive and equal workplace and society.

[Martin Lipton](http://www.wlrk.com/MLipton/), one of the founders of Wachtell Lipton and the creator of the “poison pill,” was absolutely “appalled” by President Trump’s statements, writing, “Hate and bigotry are offensive to the American Constitution, the American dream and the overwhelming majority of the American people. I join with and I applaud those business leaders, public officials and others who have disassociated themselves from President Trump’s statements.”

[W. Russell Welsh](http://www.polsinelli.com/professionals/wrwelsh), CEO and chairman of Polsinelli, shared the following words:

With the horrific words and actions of so called white nationalists in Charlottesville this past weekend, now is the time to celebrate and reinforce our values of diversity and inclusion.

We want to make clear that while violence by anyone is unacceptable, there is no equivalence between the hate mongers who espouse racist and anti-Semitic ideology and those who protest against these views. We deplore and reject the comments of our political leaders who fail to recognize this distinction and to denounce these evil, anti American ideologies. Our firm stands resolutely against these groups and their beliefs.

Bryan Cave tweeted out a statement given by its chair, [Therese Pritchard](https://www.bryancave.com/en/people/therese-d-pritchard.html):

— Bryan Cave LLP (@BryanCaveLLP) [August 16, 2017](https://twitter.com/BryanCaveLLP/status/897884836504973312)

Katelyn Polantz of ALM gathered various statements from several Biglaw firms and tweeted them publicly, including those from the leaders of WilmerHale, Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer’s chair [Richard Alexander](https://www.apks.com/en/people/a/alexander-richard-m), the leaders of Crowell & Moring, Latham & Watkins’s chair [Bill Voge](https://www.lw.com/people/william-voge), the leaders of Hogan Lovells, Akin Gump’s chair [Kim Koopersmith](https://www.akingump.com/en/lawyers-advisors/kim-koopersmith.html), and Greenberg Traurig’s chair [Richard Rosenbaum](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/r/rosenbaum-richard-a). All of these statements can be found on the next page.

It’s refreshing to see that the leaders of some of America’s largest and most prestigious law firms are willing to step up, call out hate-mongering, and affirm their commitment to making the world a better place through efforts to promote diversity and inclusion.

# 3 Biglaw Attorneys, Including Practice Group Leader, Test Positive For COVID-19
## The firm is 'closely monitoring developments' as to their condition.

We have some unfortunate news to report today, as we’ve learned that three Biglaw attorneys were infected with the novel coronavirus during an international business trip.

The group hailed from the Hong Kong office of Mayer Brown and traveled to London in early March for an arbitration case. Recall that the firm, after trying to bring its Hong Kong workforce back to the office, was recently [forced to reinstate its work-from-home policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-reinstates-coronavirus-work-from-home-policy-after-blowback-from-employees/) after facing major blowback from employees who were quite worried considering that COVID-19 had started making a comeback in the area thanks to lifted social-distancing restrictions.

[The Standard](https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/11/217892/Infections-in-legal-cluster-grow-to-four), a local Hong Kong paper, has identified partner and international arbitration practice co-leader Menachem Hasofer as one of the lawyers who contracted COVID-19, along with two coworkers. [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/2020/04/03/three-mayer-brown-hong-kong-lawyers-test-positive-for-covid-19-292-64658/) has a statement from the firm on the well-being of its attorneys:

“We confirm that all three of our Hong Kong-based colleagues who had recently returned to Hong Kong together from an overseas business trip have unfortunately all tested positive for COVID-19,” the firm said in a statement. …

Mayer Brown said all three members of the Hong Kong office immediately volunteered for a 14-day quarantine upon their return. “They have not been to any of our offices nor, as far as we are aware, have had any direct interaction with other members of our firm for around a month,” the firm said Friday.

The firm said it encourages “any person in our Hong Kong office who has concerns to work from home” and is closely monitoring developments.

We wish Hasofer and his colleagues the best of luck as they recover from the virus.

Departure memos are a [time honored tradition in Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/farewell-email/?rf=1) — a way to let your colleagues know what you’ll be up to when you leave… and maybe [burn a few bridges](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/does-this-memo-a-burn-every-bridge-or-b-burn-most-of-the-bridges/) on the way [out the door.](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/do-them-your-fking-self-departing-associate-tells-partner/) But [not all farewell messages](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/a-biglaw-partners-amazing-farewell-message/) are bitter screeds lamenting the terrible conditions at their firm.

The latest offering to the farewell email pantheon making the rounds is an adorable ode to both Game of Thrones and the long hard hours of Biglaw life. The firm in question and other identifying information had been redacted by the time it made its way to Above the Law, but that almost makes it better. The specific firm doesn’t matter — any Biglaw outfit could fit the bill — it’s the sacrifice and dedication to the profession that is making it a must read.

# Major International Law Firm's Instagram Account Taken Over By Dancing Kid
## Maybe this will inspire a Biglaw trend!

Working from home isn’t easy. I think this far into our self isolation/social distancing experiment we can all admit that. And those of you, erm, locked up with families have it even worse. Tiny spaces, boredom, a pandemic, and kids just don’t mix well. One family has also learned the hard way that it can create an epic social media faux pas.

As revealed by [Roll on Friday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-simmons-simmons-insta-hijacked-employees-dancing-daughter), an employee at Simmons & Simmons, a U.K.-based firm with $500,311,000 in 2018 gross revenue making them [93rd on the Global 200](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=276&name=Simmons-%26-Simmons,-P.C.), had his phone hijacked by his daughter who then, in turn, took over the [Simmons & Simmons Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/simmons_simmonsllp/?hl=en) with some sick dance moves. Taking place in a backyard, the daughter broadcast her skills to the musical stylings of U.K. artist [Wiley’s song Heatwave, featuring vocals by Ms D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59f-6g3Bnks).

The good folks at Roll on Friday have a breakdown of exactly what happened on the now deleted post (because of course):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The live show captures ‘Lil D’ dancing to, “On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body” until mum ruins everything by stopping the music.

“Mum! Muuum”, complains Lil D, “What did you dooo?”

“Get off the phone”, replies the girl’s mother. Lil D responds by turning the music back on, jumping into the frame and continuing to work it for her concert fans.

“Where’s my phone?” asks mum. “Your work phone’s there”, replies her daughter. “Where’s my other phone?” “There!” shouts Lil D, still grooving.

There is a panicked pause from mum. “Are you on instagram?”

“Yeah”, replies the girl, and mum grabs the phone.

“Wait!” cries Lil D.

Mum’s face looms into shot as the girl keeps on dancing in the background.

“Are you on, um…”, asks mum, with a distinct sliver of doubt in her voice. At which point her daughter grabs back the phone and dashes into the house, giggling.

“Oi!” shouts her father. Lil D stops. “Wait, is this your work one?”, she asks innocently.

“Yes!” screams dad. “Oh”, remarks the chastened girl, and the video feed cuts out on the best post which Simmons & Simmons has produced, or ever will.

In case the written word doesn’t quite capture the essence of this WFH snafu, a recording (with all the parties’ faces blurred) of the IG live show is available.


While Simmons & Simmons hasn’t commented on the incident, I, for one, think it’s great. It’s the most relatable thing that’s happened in Biglaw in, like, forever.

Another elite Biglaw firm has stepped out to join the COVID-19 bonus wars, and this time, it’s all about the hours. Let’s get this party started.

Over at Weil Gotshal, the more hours you’ve billed, the more money you’ll get. For most firms that came before this announcement, bonuses were simply based on associate class year. We’ll do a quick comparison of the bonus scales. Here’s an excerpt from a memo that was sent by Weil executive partner Barry Wolf (available in full on the next page), explaining why the firm is doing things this way, and what their bonus schedule looks like:

We recognize that, given varying client demand levels, the workloads taken on to meet the increased demand we have faced during this period were not equally shared.  To account for these differences, we will be paying the bonus out not by class year but by the schedule set forth below based on annualized hours worked during this calendar year (January 1 – August 31).

- Below 1800 hours – $10,000
- 1800-1999 hours – $20,000
- 2000-2299 hours – $30,000
- 2300-2599 hours – $40,000
- More than 2600 hours – $50,000

WOW, a $50,000 bonus — that sure sounds nice! Now, let’s take a look at the [Davis Polk scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) again, so we can see how things measure up:

- Class of 2019: $7,500
- Class of 2018: $10,000
- Class of 2017: $20,000
- Class of 2016: $27,500
- Class of 2015: $32,500
- Class of 2014: $37,000
- Class of 2013: $40,000
The most relevant question here seems to be, how many people at Weil will wind up worse off than they would if the firm had broken these bonuses down by class year? It’s incredibly easy to offer a $50K bonus when you know that only a few people will qualify for one. Thus far, we haven’t heard any complaints, so we’ll have to wait and see how things shake out.

UPDATE (4:25 p.m.): Hold that thought, because some people are not at all thrilled with these bonuses. “[P]artners have been telling associates to limit billing to clients and bill excess to nonbillable and have not been giving out billable work despite requests for it,” says one disappointed associate. Yikes. Here are some additional thoughts from another one of our sources at Weil:

[A]ssociates are not happy. After encouraging associates to take vacation in August, the firm cuts off annualizing hours are the end of that month. The joke is on you if you took that vacation! It is also a very odd way of doing things for a firm with “no hours requirement.” For a senior associate to make market, this memo imposes a minimum of 2,300 hours. Bankruptcy associates are maybe the only ones happy with this. Everyone else is pissed.

UPDATE (9/25): It seems like there are incredibly mixed feelings about this bonus over at Weil. Here’s what we’ve heard from several sources at the firm.

Incredibly disappointing and so out of line with firm culture (or at least what I thought was firm culture…) and how the firm’s always emphasized the benefits of NOT tying billables to bonuses. Now all that seems disingenuous. This is particularly insensitive since the “worse off” here are likely disproportionately the more senior associates dealing with kids at home for several months.

Weil’s bonus structure is a slap in the face for working moms left without childcare during the pandemic. In order to bill some of those amounts, you would have to be committing child abuse/neglect!

For the Weil bonus structure, it punishes working parents who have had less availability to bill their typical amounts do to child care constraints.

Weil brags publicly about not having a billable hours requirement, but for some reason this bonus is hours-based.  For anyone out there watching from home, this should be suspect on its face.  This hours-based, tier structure is merely intended to give the firm cover to cheap out on the otherwise lockstep special bonuses being paid by Weil peer firms.

The bonuses across the market at other firms are NOT dependent on high billing.  Those other bonuses are (appropriately) compensating for particularly difficult and stressful factors that people having to work from home have been dealing with — e.g., working from home and simultaneously providing child care, homeschooling their kids, not having a dedicated quiet work space in a cramped NYC apartment, etc. — all while the firm is saving money on operating costs.  Sure, giving very high billers a larger bonus is certainly nice, but it should not be at the expense of dinging associates in groups that are slower or where associates are being encouraged to not bill all of their time.

Senior associate at Weil here. The bonus is BS. You know the partners sat there calculating on one hand how many people are annualizing 2600. Similarly, the slow folks who are annualizing 1500 hours also get 10k? How does that make any sense.

I’m an associate at Weil (not in BFR) and am very happy with bonuses being tied to hours, as are many of my colleagues since many ppl have above-average hours. Saw a comment you posted that folks vacationing in August are unhappy. Could be, but annualizing hours takes into account vacation so vacation between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31 would actually increase an associate’s total annualized hours.

Reading the comments about Weil, I have only heard of one person who is disappointed because they were senior and their hours were low. Most associates are making out far better, especially junior associates who are getting double, triple, or even quadruple what they would have expected under the Davis Polk scale. I’ve never had someone tell me not to bill my time, and have been getting plenty of work. Also note they are including pro Bono hours in the calculation, so if you were slow you could have picked up ample opportunities to do great pro Bono work, which the firm frequently encouraged. This is incredible and everyone is talking about how they are going to spend their new found money! Weil is crushing it.

I hate that associates are reporting they’re not happy about the Weil bonuses. From the groups I’ve been talking to, everyone is thrilled (and I’m not a bankruptcy attorney). Additionally, the secondees who helped in other practice groups who were slammed, and the bankruptcy attorneys that have been working around the clock, really feel appreciated. #Weil’dAboutWeil

Perhaps most important of all, Wolf notes in his memo that this fall bonus “will not impact the year-end bonuses that will be paid in January 2021” and that those bonuses will be “at least equal to those paid in January 2020.”

Congratulations to everyone at Weil on their bonuses.

Above the Law spends a lot of time documenting all of the bonus moves in Biglaw. But what does bonus season really mean? We’ll leave the [heartwarming tales](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/i-wonder-if-the-big-city-lawyer-will-choose-love-or-career/) to the Hallmark channel, but it is an opportunity for firms to show associates just how much they’re appreciated… which will hopefully convince associates to stay put in a[ red-hot lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-job-offers-without-interviews-what-hath-the-hot-lateral-market-wrought/).

So which firm is the latest to flex its financial muscle in the pursuit of talent retention?

Gibson Dunn — with its 1400+ attorneys and $2,160,542,000 in gross revenue last year — has announced their own set of bonus numbers. And, shocking exactly no one, it’s a match of the prevailing scale.

# More About Making Partner At Sullivan & Cromwell (Part 1)
## Some women at S&C feel that their firm can -- and must -- do better at promoting women.

Our recent report on the [newly elected partners at Sullivan & Cromwell](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/sullivan-cromwells-new-partners-impressive-yes-diverse-not-so-much/) generated some critical reader feedback. We pointed out that the new partner class of five white men was not a model of demographic diversity. But we also, in fairness to the firm, shared some defenses of S&C: (1) over the past 10 years, 16 out of the firm’s 61 new partners, or 26 percent, were women; (2) the New York litigation practice, singled out as “particularly bad” on gender diversity, made three women partners in the past decade; and (3) the firm is “within range” of its peer firms.

These defenses of S&C didn’t go over so well with some of our sources. As one tipster told us:

S&C is lying about women partners in New York litigation. They made two women partners in 2007. Since then, it has been 11 white men and zero women or minorities. They are trying to count [Kathleen McArthur](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/KathleenS-McArthur) from 2015, but she was an associate in D.C., which is not nearly as sexist as New York. Her partnership offer was conditioned on moving to New York…. No current female associate in New York litigation has seen a woman named partner. It’s truly Trump’s America at 125 Broad.

Said a second source:

The statement from Sullivan that three of the six litigator women who were made partner in the New York office in the last 10 years is not entirely true and very misleading. Two female partners were made in the New York office in 2007 (nine years ago). Then last year, one woman was made partner in D.C. (where the majority of her career developed), but was told she had to move to NYC. This move was used to try to limit the outrage by the women associates in New York. It didn’t….

We did some digging into the Kathleen McArthur situation. Sources at the firm reject any claim that she was forced to move back to New York upon making partner, stating that it was her own decision to return. During her years as an associate, she split her time between New York — where she actually started her S&C career, as a summer associate — and Washington. Over the years, she developed an expertise in litigation relating to commodities and derivatives trading, which caused her to spend more and more time in New York, the base of many of her clients. When she made partner, she asked to relocate to New York to reduce her travel time. As a mother of two, McArthur understandably did not want to spend so many hours on trains and planes.

Another encouraging fact about Kathleen McArthur: she was elected partner while working a flex-time schedule. Her oldest child was born in April 2013, and when she returned to work in October 2013 after six months of parental leave, she did so on a part-time schedule. She was still on that part- or flex-time schedule when elected partner [in November 2015](https://www.sullcrom.com/press-release-sullivan-and-cromwell-announces-election-of-six-partners), near the end of her eighth year at the firm. (She is now back to a full-time schedule, after having her second child and taking another six months of parental leave earlier this year.)

But let’s not let S&C off too easily. According to its [website](https://www.sullcrom.com/professionals-search-results?firstlastname=&lastname=&position=0&practice=28&school=0&keyword=&office=7&clerkship=0&language=0&Mfirstlastname=&Mlastname=&Mkeyword=&Mposition=0&Moffice=0&Mpractice=0&Mschool=0&Mclerkship=0&Mlanguage=0&btn_profSrch_desktop=find+lawyers), S&C has around 180 litigators based in New York. Even counting McArthur as a New York partner, making three women partners in litigation in a decade is not exactly impressive. S&C has 38 litigation partners in New York; of those 38, just eight are women (or 21 percent, below the 26 percent representation of women in S&C’s past decade of new partners).

How does S&C compare to its peer firms on gender diversity? Is it “within range” of its fellow Vault 10 firms? Earlier this year, we released Above the Law’s [Gender Diversity Index](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-atl-law-firm-gender-diversity-index-2016/), which gives letter grades to firms based on factors including, but not limited to, the representation of women in the partnership. Here are how the V10 firms stack up (full index [here](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/law-firm-gender-diversity-index-2016/)):

1. Cravath, Swaine & Moore: C+
2. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz: C
3. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom: B
4. Sullivan & Cromwell: C+
5. Davis Polk & Wardwell: B-
6. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett: B
7. Latham & Watkins: B-
8. Kirkland & Ellis: C+
9. Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton: B
10. Gibson Dunn & Crutcher: B-

(Note: The [Gender Diversity Index](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/law-firm-gender-diversity-index-2016/) was prepared by my colleagues on Above the Law’s research team. Please direct all questions about the index and its methodology to them, by email: [research@abovethelaw.com](mailto:research@abovethelaw.com?subject=Gender%20Diversity%20Index).)

Sullivan & Cromwell gets a C+, and the median grade for V10 firms is a B-. So S&C is a little behind its peer firms, but not incredibly so — i.e., “within range.” But a grade of C+ is not something to crow about. It would certainly kill your chances of getting hired at SullCrom.

Sadly, this isn’t a new issue for the firm, one source said:

This is a longstanding problem. See Blank v. Sullivan & Cromwell, [litigation in the 1970s when S&C was sued] for gender discrimination in hiring.

(That was a long time ago, so one shouldn’t be too hard on S&C — conduct from decades ago looks very different when measured against today’s standards — but note that the firm [sought the recusal](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2010/08/05/exclusive-judicial-ethics-expert-says-call-to-r/168820) of Judge [Constance Baker Motley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Baker_Motley), the first African-American woman appointed to the federal bench. The firm argued that Judge Motley, as an African-American woman who worked on civil rights cases before becoming a judge, “strongly identifies with those who suffer discrimination in employment because of sex or race.” Judge Motley shot that down: “if background or sex or race of each judge were, by definition, sufficient grounds for removal, no judge on this court could hear this case, or many others, by virtue of the fact that all of them were attorneys, of a sex, often with distinguished law firm or public service backgrounds.”)

Back to our S&C source:

During the 1990s and 2000s, few women were promoted to partner, and a high percentage of those who were had relationships with male partners at the time of their promotion. The ‘affairs problem,’ as it is known internally, became so bad that in the early 2000s the firm instituted a ‘no dancing’ policy at firm events….

It has always been a place that has struggled with gender. There is extreme sensitivity within the firm to consistently losing women law students to Davis and Simpson, which are perceived (rightly or wrongly) as more woman-friendly. [Former chair H. Rodgin Cohen] tried to make progress on this issue by forming various women’s groups and committees and trying to promote more women. The consensus within the partnership seems to be that these efforts did not work. [Current chair Joseph] Shenker seems to have given up trying. [A different source confirmed this: “Rodge was a champion of women’s programs and trying to make all staff happy. Joe is the opposite, and he ended the mothers’ group, which was one of the more successful women’s mentoring groups we had.”]

The prevailing view seems to be that the firm has a bad reputation with women, and since reputation is hard to change, it is no longer going to play a game it can’t seem to win. This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Some say the lack of recent female partners in New York is a reflection of difficulty recruiting top women from the top law schools. They then feel justified in not promoting more women. One way the firm has tried to avoid the appearance of sexism is to promote women in satellite offices, where there is not as much of a boys’ club mentality.

In short, Sullivan & Cromwell has a long way to go when it comes to achieving gender balance in its partnership ranks. And setting aside the specifics of any particular partnership class or individual partner, the anger that women at S&C feel — anger they have communicated to us here at Above the Law, loud and clear, on multiple occasions — suggests that the firm has work to do when it comes to making women lawyers feel welcome.

So that’s how things look at Sullivan & Cromwell in terms of the partnership prospects of women lawyers. In a subsequent story, we’ll tackle a different issue raised by sources: is S&C stretching out its partnership track, promoting to partner from the ranks of special counsel instead of associates? If you look at the firm’s [five new partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/sullivan-cromwells-new-partners-impressive-yes-diverse-not-so-much/2/), just one was an associate prior to promotion; the other four were special counsel.

UPDATE (9:30 a.m.): Two additional comments, which reflect the divide discussed above between New York and the other offices:

1. From a New York source: “I think the most notable stat is that 20 of the last 21 new partners in New York have been men.”

2. From a non-New York source: “The last four homegrown partners made on the West Coast were all female, two litigators (Diane McGimsey and Laura Oswell) and two General Practice (Sarah Payne and Rita O’Neill). S&C lost a big female New York litigator in Stacey Friedman when she left to become [GC of J.P. Morgan’s corporate and investment banking unit](http://www.wsj.com/articles/j-p-morgan-chase-general-counsel-to-change-roles-1436192197) [and subsequently rose to become [GC of J.P. Morgan Chase as a whole](http://www.wsj.com/articles/j-p-morgan-chase-general-counsel-to-change-roles-1436192197)]. Probably also worth taking a look at female representation on the committee compared to peer firms. I fear that your article may dissuade females from joining what is a more female-friendly firm than the article suggests.”

UPDATE (10:05 a.m.): On Kathleen McArthur making partner while on a part-time schedule, one source reports that she worked very, very hard during her “flex-time” period: “Katy McArthur’s pre-partner ‘flex-time’ year was most full-time associates’ billable year from hell.”

UPDATE (3:36 p.m.): From a new source, a Sullivan & Cromwell alum:

The firm’s line on not being able to recruit good female talent is not credible. S&C passed on an Asian woman litigator who came up through New York [a number of years] ago. She is an amazing lawyer, had plenty of experience at trial and had done appeals at the Second Circuit, obscenely organized, and a pleasure to work with. She was promoted to Special Counsel and told that they would consider her for partner in two years. She wasn’t having it and decamped to another firm. It was a big loss for S&C.

[W]hen the firm holds onto certain [problematic] people, it’s not surprising that terrific women lawyers leave after a few years (and after receiving the best possible training a young lawyer could ask for). [A certain white male retired partner] still maintains an active litigation practice and comes to mind as an example of someone who is notorious for his treatment of women (and more generally being a miserable person to work with). Notwithstanding his brilliance, holding on to people like [him] is a tacit endorsement of behavior that is a vestige of a boys’ club from 30 years ago. It is a terrible signal to send.

Don’t get me wrong: I think S&C is an amazing firm with the most capable group of lawyers I have ever worked with. I’m grateful for the opportunity that I had to work there. I think that I am in many ways a better lawyer than many of the people I work with — not because of some innate ability but because S&C (including the miserable partner I alluded to) developed me so well. But after leaving the firm and seeing what it’s like elsewhere, my eyes were really opened up to how things are better elsewhere (although not perfect). Hopefully this comes as a signal to the firm that they should start adapting to a more modern world.

# Law Firm Lateral Partner Hiring Doomed By Atrocious Due Diligence
## This is a pretty expensive mistake.

All firms will fail at lateral hiring at some point. Unfortunately, these are extremely costly failures, impacting firm finances, cultural stability, brand and client relationships. In terms of significance, determining cultural fit is the most important decision a hiring firm will make. A hire that fails to meet this standard can be doomed regardless of the candidate’s legal skills or business acumen.

— [Steve Kovalan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevekovalan), a senior analyst at ALM Legal Intelligence, commenting on the results of a [lateral hiring report](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202774413388/Law-Firms-Struggle-With-Lateral-Partner-Due-Diligence-Report-Finds?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=3) which indicated that while 96 percent of respondents considered hiring laterals with a client following important to their revenue growth strategies, less than half of laterals actually delivered on their expected books of business. It seems many firms have no formal vetting process for their laterals.

The Biglaw salary wars have been going nigh on a month. But, given the rapid pace at which the big players are now making compensation announcements, stasis may finally be reached,

Weil Gotshal, which made $1,657,603,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it 17 on the Am Law 100, delighted associates today with raises. As expected, the elite law firm will be matching the scale Davis Polk announced earlier this week.

That means associates at Weil will be paid according to the following scale:

Class Year	Base Salary Retroactive to January 1, 2022
2021	$215,000
2020	$225,000
2019	$250,000
2018	$293,500
2017	$335,000
2016	$360,500
2015	$381,000
2014	$396,500
And like many of their peer firms, the raises will be retroactive to January 1 and will hit bank accounts in March. Read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/wgm-raises-22/2/)

# How To Tackle The Q4 Job Search
## An introspective approach allows you to analyze and assess your negotiating power.

Q4 is here and that begs the question for many lawyers: should I stay, or should I go? The answer (of course) is: it depends. Q4 is a popular time for many to start the process of contemplating a job move. The anticipation of the end of the year draws significant attention to the need for change and seeking out new career goals. But, quite often, fears and self-doubt creep in — will a budget or hiring freeze impact me, or is it a strategic move to jump ship now? What about layoffs that are widespread across LinkedIn?

I ask job seekers to process a series of questions before they dive into a Q4 job search. One of those questions centers on how the bonus structure works at the company or firm and whether they would be leaving money on the table by exiting before year-end. Keep in mind, many opt to finish up year-end at a company and instead go full throttle in a Q1 job search. Once mid-October hits, year-end fatigue sets in, and before you know it, the holidays are here, and so is the end of the year.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Before embarking on a job search, you’ll want to review your compensation structure, bonus schedule, PTO/vacation time, and 401(k) vesting. It may be advantageous to update your career marketing documents (resume, bio, deal sheet, and LinkedIn profile) and stay through end of Q1 in the next fiscal year to secure that long-awaited and lofty bonus. It’s also a good reminder to take accrued PTO or consider cashing it out when putting in your notice.

This introspective approach allows you to analyze and assess your negotiating power if you do decide to make a power move and leave your company or firm before bonus payout. It also puts you in a stronger position to advise an executive recruiter that you’re giving up X dollars by leaving the company or firm three months earlier than anticipated.

What can you do in the interim to prepare for a Q4 job search? Here’s a helpful checklist to get started:

- Perform an in-depth audit of your resume and LinkedIn. Make sure both are in an optimal state to engage with outreach to recruiters and your network. The next logical step will be contacting warm leads and increasing networking activity. I have two helpful articles on [updating your legal resume](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/quick-ways-to-refresh-optimize-and-modernize-your-legal-resume/) and [making quick changes to your LinkedIn profile](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/quick-ways-to-refresh-and-optimize-your-linkedin-profile/) to prepare for a job search. These are filled with various tips and strategies to get you up to speed on trends for a digital-age job search.
- Take notice if you have irrelevant content on your resume or LinkedIn profile. Make sure dates and job titles line up. Remove inaccurate or outdated information — for example, no one needs the intricate details of the associate role you had in 1992. Giving the areas of practice and focus is enough.
- Invest in upgrading to a high-resolution LinkedIn headshot. The [Headshot Crew](https://headshotcrew.com/) (founded by expert headshot photographer [Peter Hurley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhurley/)) provides a great database to search for a trained headshot photographer in your geographic area. If you do extensive speaking engagements, the investment of a professional headshot will pay off in dividends.
- Run a Google search on your name. See what’s out there about you — perhaps a recent podcast interview, a panel presentation, or a media feature. Consider linking it to your featured section on your LinkedIn profile.
- Chart out your [job search strategy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/how-to-create-a-job-search-strategy-that-actually-works/). Make a list of targeted companies or law firms you want to perform outreach to, along with a list of managing partners or targeted legal and business executives you plan to network with. Seek out [informational interviews](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/how-to-power-your-career-transition-or-job-search-with-an-informational-interview/) — they are powerful leverage in a crowded and competitive job market. Remember, a successful job search is one where you’re [organized](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/effective-strategies-to-organize-your-job-search-and-keep-a-positive-mindset/) and prepared.
- Consider working with an executive or career coach that specializes in legal careers. More than 85% of my senior executive and C-suite clients (in law and outside) have worked with or are concurrently working with an executive and/or leadership coach to prioritize their next career step. Tackling that [next general counsel job search](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/ways-to-prepare-for-and-tackle-your-next-general-counsel-job-search/) might feel overwhelming, especially if you haven’t done so in a decade or longer. An executive or career coach can help you to get unstuck, create clarity from chaos, and help you work through the emotions of making a career move.
- Strategically increase your connections on LinkedIn. Set a goal for yourself to reach out to a specific number of legal and business executives weekly to increase your visibility on the platform. Consider investing in a LinkedIn premium membership to get more competitive intelligence insights on job postings and for targeted outreach, such as sending InMail messages. Remember, having an [effective networking strategy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/how-to-build-a-strong-network-and-create-an-effective-networking-strategy-on-linkedin/) is key.

As the year winds down, take inventory of things you’ve learned, contributions you’ve made in your legal department (or for the overall business enterprise) and reflect on upcoming end-of-year performance evaluations. There is no time like Q4 to focus on creating goals and objectives for the new calendar year.

# This Biglaw Firm's Leader Promises Not To Conduct Layoffs
## No job cuts at this firm? Hope it's a promise its leader can keep!

News of Biglaw layoffs is spreading across the Am Law 200, but one law firm leader is drawing a line in the sand, and pledging that his firm won’t follow along when it comes to job cuts.

Michael Heller, CEO of Cozen O’Connor — a firm that brought in $584,802,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it at No. 77 in the most recent Am Law 100 — recently sat down for an interview with Bloomberg Law, where he said that the firm’s focus on financial stability will allow it to sidestep making layoffs, even amid rising economic uncertainties in 2023 and beyond.

“We don’t want to be the firm that pays the highest salaries when times are great, terminates the associates when times are bad and then just keeps going through that cycle,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Law. “We have always said to our partners ‘if you’re looking to make the most money you can in this world, you’re at the wrong firm.’”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It should be noted that Heller’s interview with Bloomberg took place on the same day that Goodwin announced layoffs en masse. At the time, Heller said that Cozen O’Connor will “absolutely not” conduct layoffs (but it did [cut its special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/cozen-special-bonus-2022/) last month, noting a decline in revenue).

Even if the firm doesn’t match the soaring salaries and bonuses doled out by many firms during boom times, it also didn’t cut associates during the 2008-2009 recession or slash salaries when others scrambled to tighten their belts in the early pandemic panic.

“We’ve always taken the position that we don’t want to be the firm that will pay the highest salary when the times are great, terminate the associates when times are bad, and keep going through that cycle,” Heller said. “We culturally believe it is our fiduciary duty—our moral obligation—to provide a platform for younger lawyers to build a career whether it’s through a good economy or a bad economy.”

Instead of layoffs, Heller said Cozen is looking to expand and continue to grow its firm footprint, telling Bloomberg that, “We’ll take this opportunity if there’s a recession to spend a lot of money to continue to expand our business. We have the resources and the desire to do it, and we’re going to continue to do it.”

Let’s cross our fingers and hope that Cozen O’Connor will be able to hold true to its leader’s words and avoid layoffs. It sure would be nice if other firms could make the same commitment to its employees, but we don’t think we’ll see many more willing to make the same promise.

More than 1,000 lawyers work for the new firm across 24 offices in the U.S. and U.K. As with most mergers, some layoffs could be ahead.

# Will Legal Holiday Parties Fully Return This Year?
## Holiday parties enable lawyers to learn more about their work colleagues than might be possible in an office.

Holiday parties are an annual tradition at many law firms as numerous shops hold events to assemble their employees in a social setting and bring more cheer to everyone around that special time of the year. During the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all law firms cancelled their holiday parties in order to promote social distancing to combat spread of the virus. Even though the pandemic is mostly in the rear-view mirror, many firms and other legal organizations still did not host holiday parties last year. That is a shame, and, hopefully, law firms and other legal organizations will hold holiday parties to the same extent this year as before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Perhaps the most significant reason for why law firms have not held holiday parties like they used to is that many law firms in the years after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic felt that it might not be prudent in case the party became a superspreader event. This was less of a concern in 2021 than in 2020, and even less so in 2022, but the sentiment was still present. Some people still do not feel comfortable walking around in public without wearing a mask, and it might not be reasonable to expect them to attend a holiday party when they still have concerns about COVID-19.

For many law firms, I believe that cost savings is another reason for not holding pre-COVID level parties. Holiday parties can be expensive. Depending on the venue, an event can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars. I have attended all kinds of holiday parties in my career, from the decadent to the meager. One time, I worked at a law firm that had a holiday party at a country club, and the firm must have spent a pretty penny hosting that event. However, I also attended a holiday party that took place in a law firm office, and I would have a difficult time believing that the firm spent more than a thousand dollars on the affair.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Although the money required to host a holiday party might not be significant to bigger law firms, this can definitely impact the bottom lines of smaller shops. Many smaller firms might have gotten used to not shelling out the money needed to host a holiday party, and do not want to pay for this expense if they do not have to. Firms might use the “new normal” as cover to avoid paying for holiday parties to protect their bottom line.

Many people find holiday parties awkward and uncomfortable, which I completely understand. It can be weird interacting with bosses and work colleagues in a more social setting and some more introverted people do not like to be forced to interact with their co-workers in settings outside the workplace. However, holiday parties can be important to law firms and other legal organizations for a number of reasons.

Perhaps most importantly, holiday parties enable lawyers to learn more about their work colleagues than might be possible in an office. When people are present in a workplace, they usually only present one side of themselves since a workplace is a more rigid social environment than other situations. However, when law firms host holiday parties, lawyers will possibly be more comfortable interacting on a deeper level, which can help build firm culture and connections between colleagues.

Also, law firm parties can also be an extremely fun time. I am sure most people within the legal profession have attended a law firm holiday party or heard of one that was an epic affair that reflected positively on the shop that hosted the event. I personally miss all of the legal holiday parties I used to attend around each year, and it has been a real shame that many legal holiday parties have been curtailed in the past four years. The legal profession is stressful, and those parties can bring a much-needed sense of fun to the legal arena.

It’s a holiday party season like no other, and this year’s options run the gamut.

In this survey, we’re asking what your firm has planned — and how you really feel about it.

Are you eagerly (or reluctantly) attending? Skipping because of COVID fears? Making an excuse to stay home? 

Please take our (always) brief, (always) confidential survey to help us find out.

The career arcs of many IP lawyers are full of interesting twists and turns. Along the way, some actually find themselves creating something — whether related to their practice or not — that becomes useful to others. This week’s interviewee, Corey McCaffrey, is one such creator, who has developed and released an [app](https://acciopatent.com/) that helps patent attorneys and agents access PDF copies of patents faster. His career path is an interesting one, spanning stints in tech, Biglaw, and now in-house. Corey started programming when he was nine years old. Growing up, his family had an Apple IIGS, and he found an Applesoft BASIC programming tutorial tucked away among the manuals. He made some simple games and got hooked on the creative and technical power that computer programming unlocked. Eventually, Corey went on to study computer science at MIT.

After college, he worked as a software engineer for IBM. Corey learned a lot about patents at IBM, which inspired him to transition to a career in patent law. After law school, he worked for a Biglaw firm in D.C. for a few years before moving in-house. Today, Corey is an in-house intellectual property and privacy counsel for a high-tech company in D.C., and still enjoys coding as a hobby in his spare time. Along the way, Corey went to Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in 2008, where he watched Steve Jobs unveil the new App Store alongside the second-generation iPhone. He has been interested in developing mobile apps ever since, leading to the development of Accio Patent.

As usual, I have added some brief commentary to Corey’s answers below, but have otherwise presented his answers as he provided them. The content and opinions expressed by Corey are his own and do not represent the views of his former or current employers.

Immediately below are my written questions and Corey’s answers.

1) Describe why patent attorneys and their clients should be using your app.

Accio Patent fetches PDF copies of patents quickly using a barcode scanner or keypad. The app retrieves the patents and (optionally) syncs them to your Dropbox or iCloud account.

Patents and publications from the USPTO, EPO, WIPO, and other patent offices have barcodes. I couldn’t find any tools for patent professionals to scan those barcodes, so I decided to make one. Accio Patent scans the barcodes on printed patents or cover pages. Barcode scanning is a fast and fun way to download e-copies of patents.

You can also dial a patent number on the telephone-like keypad. I use this feature when I read a new Office Action. I can key in the cited references, and just a few moments later I have PDF copies synced to my computer and ready to review. Accio Patent is also handy for retrieving patents whenever you see patent numbers in a complaint, Information Disclosure Statement, presentation, news article, virtual patent marking webpages, and more.

GK: Every patent lawyer knows better than to expect that the USPTO and other patent offices will make the latest document retrieval and storage technology available. In fact, when I showed my high school students the USPTO website earlier this year, they thought it was a joke when I navigated to the patent search page. Like I forgot to pay a membership fee for access to the real website or something. While Google Patents and other services have helped make things a little easier, there is no doubt that patent lawyers and agents would benefit from more modern options — such as Accio Patent’s solution directed at retrieving PDF copies of patents.

2) What lessons did you take from your time as a Biglaw patent attorney that influenced the development of Accio Patent?

Although I had left my career in software engineering, I never lost my enthusiasm for technology. During my time at a firm, I applied that enthusiasm toward finding software tools that could help me work on client matters as efficiently and effectively as I could.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When it came to patents, I relied heavily on Espacenet and the other excellent resources available from the European Patent Office, in addition to data services from other patent offices around the world. I wrote simple computer programs to retrieve and analyze patent data. The knowledge I gained about these data services helped me realize that I had the interest and ability to make an app like Accio Patent. And I have a lot of other ideas for new features and other apps that will continue to make working with patents simpler and more enjoyable.

GK: Need spurs innovation. Even while Biglaw firms tend to offer at least some modern legal tech tools to their lawyers and staff, those solutions are often directed to general aspects of legal practice. For specialists like patent attorneys and patent support staff, bespoke solutions are often necessary. Corey admirably merged his professional needs with his coding capabilities to create tools that have helped his practice. And now Accio Patent is his first contribution to the patent community to help everyone do their work more efficiently.

3) How did moving in-house spur your development of Accio Patent?

At the law firm, I practiced patent law exclusively and first got the idea to create Accio Patent. After moving in-house, I had more opportunities to explore other areas of law, especially privacy law. Privacy became a priority for my app.

I did away with half-baked plans for some combination of targeted advertising, user registration, and usage tracking and analytics. The end result is much simpler and private: anyone can download and use my app immediately, without having to register or send any personal information or other data back to me. When you use Accio Patent, I do not know who you are or which patents you are searching for.

GK: Corey offers a very interesting perspective on privacy issues. We are used to apps requesting all kinds of “permissions” — often asking for access to our personal data with little or no seeming connection to the app’s actual purpose or utility. His sensitivity to privacy issues is welcome, as is the lack of concern Accio Patent’s users can have that they are somehow sharing confidential client information or work product with the app developer. Hopefully more legal tech apps will adopt a similar approach to privacy issues, even if it hampers their data collection efforts to some degree.

My thanks to Corey for the insights and cooperation, and I wish him continued success and fulfillment with his legal career and Accio Patent. It is always a privilege to hear from an up-and-coming IP personality, especially one with such a big role to play in developing a useful bit of technology for IP lawyers to use. I am always open to conducting interviews of this type with other IP thought leaders, so feel free to reach out if you have a compelling perspective to offer.

# Billion-Dollar Am Law 50 Firm Walks Back Its COVID-19 Salary Reductions

As days and weeks go by in these uncertain times brought about by the pandemic, Biglaw firms continue to monitor and reassess their financial situations. Many that put precautionary austerity measures into place are now taking a step back adjusting their previously announced reductions in salary (and in some cases, staff).

The latest firm to roll back salary reductions is K&L Gates, another member of the billion-dollar club that placed 39th in the Am Law 100, with $1,026,626,000 in 2019 gross revenue. Back in April, the firm [reduced salaries across the board](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/k-l-gates-cuts/), with equity partners seeing a 20 percent reduction in scheduled advances, and firm leaders taking even larger reductions. Income partners, associates, and allied professionals and staff were subject to a 15 percent reduction in their salary provided their income didn’t fall below a $75,000 floor (with some regional variations).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Now, because the firm has “performed better than expected” in 2020, those reductions are being reduced. Here’s a relevant excerpt from a memo (available in full on the next page) sent by [Jim Segerdahl](https://www.klgates.com/James-R-Segerdahl), the firm’s global managing partner:

- Our equity partners will continue to lead in this regard, as has been a driving principle from the outset.  Instead of the previously imposed 20% reduction in their normally scheduled advances each month, starting at the end of September the advances will be 15% less than normal, with our Management Committee personnel continuing to take larger reductions.
- Most other personnel across the Firm (Income Partners, Associates and Allied Professionals/Staff) previously were taking a 15% reduction in their annualized salary (as permitted by and in accordance with local laws and necessary procedures where required) to the extent they have an annualized salary at or above a pre-determined floor. Given the Firm’s strong performance to this stage, this Covid-reduction will be reduced by 33% to 10% going forward starting with the work period commencing at the beginning of September.
- The pre-determined floor will shift upward from $75,000 to $100,000, again subject to appropriate regional differences. Personnel whose pre-reduction compensation was between $75,001 and $100,000 will return to their pre-reduction compensation as of September 1.
Remember, the firm is still holding open the door for bonuses in light of “extraordinary performances or contributions” during the coronavirus crisis, and in this memo, Segerdahl reminded everyone that because the firm’s future depends on everyone’s dedication, leadership “will not fail to recognize this and act accordingly.”

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# White Counsel At Biglaw Firm Spreads 'Inappropriate And Offensive' Theories About Abortion, Gets Suspended
## UPDATE: There are consequences!

In all fairness, this likely began with the best of intentions. Earlier this week, the Women’s Initiative Network at Hogan Lovells held a Zoom call about the recent [Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/the-end-of-roe-is-here/)which unraveled the right to abortion care.

But then things went off the rails.

A white partner who attended HoLove’s women’s meeting felt it appropriate to chime in with her support of the Dobbs decision. As a tipster at the firm described it, “Robin Keller, in front of nearly 400 women, shared her views that Dobbs was rightly decided and that Black women are disproportionately getting abortions and conducting ‘Black genocide’ which she finds ‘tragic.'” Yikes.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Another tipster described it as “spouting out racial vitriol about Black women abortions being a genocide that luckily Dobbs stops.” According to accounts, another partner “eloquently shut her down to the ground,” and asked Keller to leave the call. But, tipsters report that wasn’t the end of the screed, as Keller “wrote in the Zoom chat that we should channel our ‘rage’ into understanding other people’s point of view.”

Reaction to the incident from insiders at the firm reflects how troubling it was. One person described being “traumatized and hurt,” saying, “It was unreal.” Another was more blunt: “A woman needs to be fired.”

I’m unlikely to be as eloquent as those who ended Keller’s tirade in the moment, but let’s take a beat to break down why this argument is so harmful. Professor SaraEllen Strongman [notes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/06/29/despite-anti-abortion-campaigns-black-feminists-support-abortion-rights/) that Black feminists have long understood the importance of reproductive freedom:

Black feminists still fiercely advocated for the right to abortion because they understood the importance of bodily autonomy, especially when it comes to reproduction.

Why? Because abortion had long been a strategy of survival and resistance for Black women. Historians have revealed that abortion even enabled some semblance of self-determination during slavery. Enslaved women could thwart enslavers’ ability to use their children as chattel to generate profit with birth control and abortion.

Strongman further places support for choice in historical context pointing out Shirley Chisholm’s support:

Instead Chisholm argued that reproductive choice enabled women and their families to achieve economic prosperity and ensure that the next generation of Black children were “reared amid love and stability, and educated to the limit of their ability.”

Chisholm argued that safe, legal abortion was a matter of survival, citing a study by Edwin M. Gold that found 49 percent of the deaths of pregnant Black women were caused by botched abortions. Chisholm also emphasized that poor women and women of color were then, as they are today, the least likely to be able to access quality medical care, including abortion.

And in 1989, Donna Brazile, along with other Black women leaders, authored “We Remember: African American Women for Reproductive Freedom” which began:

“Choice is the essence of freedom. It’s what we African Americans have struggled for all these years. The right to choose where we would sit on a bus. The right to vote. The right for each of us to select our own paths, to dream and reach for our dreams. The right to choose how we would or would not live our lives.”

Shyrissa Dobbins-Harris [writes in The Myth of Abortion as Black Genocide: Reclaiming our Reproductive Cycle](https://escholarship.org/content/qt0988p9xp/qt0988p9xp.pdf) that these sorts of messages about abortion are “full of misogynoir.” And places “the struggle for Black survival squarely within the wombs of Blackwomen” over the “numerous social ills facing Black people” including “rates of police brutality… or the social determinants of health, or mass incarceration, or the alarmingly high rates of new HIV infections among Blackwomen.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Language like that used in the HoLove meeting “considers Blackwomen incapable of making their own reproductive choices.” And, as Dobbins-Harris notes, similar rhetoric has been called out by Black women. Repeatedly:

Blackwomen are writing, tweeting, and creating art centering themselves and their agency in their abortion narratives. One Blackwoman author attacked Ben Carson’s harmful genocidal rhetoric writing for Aljazeera America saying, “[t]o use factually incorrect rhetoric to render our healthcare needs and experiences irrelevant is an affront to our dignity.”

Hogan Lovells provided the following statement about the incident:

“On Wednesday, our Women’s Initiative Network (WIN) held an internal forum to share their perspectives on the Dobbs decision and its impact. We were very pleased that nearly 350 people participated in this event, which was held to provide an open forum for discussion and a supportive space for our people who are concerned about these important issues. Unfortunately, one participant in the forum made comments others found inappropriate and offensive. Offensive and hurtful actions and statements are contrary to our culture, values, and business as a firm. Firm leaders promptly reached out to the firm community to express their regret about the pain and upset that this has caused our community. We appreciate that this was brought to our attention and we are treating this matter seriously. While we encourage members of our community to engage in frank, candid discussion, we expect all discussion in our place of work, or in settings sponsored by the firm, to uphold our values of inclusivity, respect for diverse members of our community, and non-discrimination.”

UPDATE: According to an internal email shared with Above the Law, Keller has been suspended, pending an internal investigation:

Unfortunately, one participant in the forum made anti-Black comments in support of her position on the Dobbs decision. Racist actions and statements are contrary to our culture, values, and business as a firm, and for the lawyers contrary to our ethical obligations. Our Black colleagues who participated in the WIN forum were hurt by those remarks. Many others were hurt, offended, and dismayed. We appreciate that this was brought to our attention and we are treating this seriously. The individual who made the remarks has been suspended pending the outcome of an internal investigation led by the office of the General Counsel.

Importantly, we offer an apology to our Black colleagues who were on the WIN call – that one person felt comfortable making such statements in that forum demonstrates that we need to do more to ensure all people are respected. We also thank the hundreds of people who spoke up during the WIN call and after. You have our gratitude for upholding our true values.

Looks like there are some welcome consequences for this troubling incident.

# Black Biglaw Partner Isn't Buying Into The Latest In-House BS On Law Firm Diversity

Despite my success in the profession, my significant name recognition and my trial skills, I have never in 28 years of practice had a single GC reach out to me based on reputation, pedigree or skill to hire me for a major matter, like many of my white counterparts have been. Every single retention I have ever gained, whether common or bet-the-company, has been based on significant marketing and sweat. This is highly unusual for a majority lawyer of my achievements.

So, what am I really saying? Stated in simple English, these signatory letters have been more public relations than actual practice. Except for a handful of GCs, signing on to these letters is a politically necessary thing to do, which ultimately requires zero accountability. So, it’s an activity that is all win with no drawback. Ask yourselves how many of these same GCs take any real measures to diversify the lawyers they hire on their meaningful matters. Very few do. …

My suggestion, and that of many of my colleagues, is that we should stop these grandiose pronouncements that continue to lead to no real improvement. They are viewed as empty PR ploys, devoid of any real measures of accountability. These repeated statements also lead to diversity fatigue in the profession, which is where I think we are now.

When companies are genuinely desirous of committing resources and real efforts to diversify the profession, I can assure you that it will not be this difficult and they will see immediate improvements and result.

— [Don Prophete](https://www.constangy.com/people-Donald-Prophete), a partner at Constangy, Brooks, Smith & Prophete (in fact, “the only black lawyer to ever have his name added to the masthead of an Am Law 250 law firm”), commenting on the [recent letter signed by more than 170 general counsel](https://www.law.com/2019/01/30/a-black-partner-responds-to-gcs-on-law-firm-diversity/) and corporate legal officers, [blasting law firms for their lack of diversity](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/01/27/170-gcs-pen-open-letter-to-law-firms-improve-on-diversity-or-lose-our-business/) and promising to take their business elsewhere if improvements were not made.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Revenue earned in 2022 was only off 10% from a record year [in 2021]. Net income was only off 15%. In the first quarter of 2023, our revenue was up 19% from 2022. Many of our core practices are thriving.

Given that our revenue is up year over year for the first quarter of 2023, I don’t see a reason to be anything other than confident that we have the partners, the clients, the business and the reputation to thrive.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
— [Adam Hakki](https://www.shearman.com/en/people/h/hakki-adam), Sherman & Sterling’s new senior partner, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/27/shearmans-financial-issues-mount-sources-say-but-new-leader-sees-path-forward-405-121418/), refuting rumors that the firm is facing financial troubles. One source told Am Law that “Shearman can pay its bills, and they can pay their associates, and they can fulfill their guarantees [to partners], but if they do all of that, there’s very little money left over for the rest of the partners.” Hakki said that Shearman’s “[p]artners are being paid consistent with our long-standing profit distribution practices,” and that the firm is not in a cash crunch. On top of that, in the wake of the firm’s layoffs in [February](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/shearman-sterling-associate-layoffs/) and [April](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/shearman-sterling-announces-more-staff-layoffs/), Hakki told Am Law that “[t]here is no current plan to initiate any additional workforce reductions at this time.” He concluded his statement, noting that 2023 will be a year of “transition” for the firm.

# Biglaw Partner Pleads Guilty Over Plot To Sell Whistleblower Lawsuits
## Now we come to the (legal) conclusion of his tale.

Jeffrey Wertkin

Jeffrey Wertkin is a bit of a favorite here at Above the Law, as his story really has all the trappings of a classic. Afterall, he was a partner at Biglaw giant Akin Gump [at the time of his arrest](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/akin-gump-lawyer-arrested-trying-to-sell-the-details-of-a-whistleblower-complaint/) on charges that he tried to sell a whistleblower complaint to the targeted company while wearing a disguise, which included a wig. That’s a pretty spectacular story any way you slice it, but then he allegedly told the arresting agent, “My life is over.” Instant classic.

As Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/sites/therecorder/2017/11/29/former-akin-partner-to-plead-guilty-in-scheme-to-sell-sealed-whistleblower-lawsuits/):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Wertkin was charged with obstruction of justice in a criminal complaint unsealed in February. Prosecutors claimed Wertkin engaged in a months-long scheme to collect a $310,000 “consulting fee” for handing over a sealed False Claims Act lawsuit against an unnamed Sunnyvale, California, company. Posing as someone named “Dan,” Wertkin allegedly reached out to a high-ranking employee at the company by phone in November 2016, alerted the employee that a sealed lawsuit was filed against the company, and offered to provide a copy of the complaint. The company alerted the FBI shortly after Wertkin reached out.

No wonder Wertkin made it to the [finals](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/the-worst-behaved-biglaw-partners-the-final-two/) of ATL’s contest for The Worst Behaved Biglaw Partners.

Now we come to the (legal) conclusion of his tale. The now former Biglaw partner pleaded guilty yesterday to two charges of obstruction of justice and one count of transporting stolen goods across state lines. Prosecutors said they will seek 30 to 37 months of prison time when he’s sentenced March 14, 2018, though the defense will try for less time:

Wertkin’s lawyer, Cristina Arguedas of Arguedas Cassman, said Wertkin “had an honorable career for a long time and then he made a series of terrible misjudgments.”

“Now he’s doing everything he can to make it right.”

The legal world has a big new player in town. But this isn’t just another Biglaw 800-pound gorilla, spawned by the latest routine mega merger. No, this is a potential King Kong of the legal industry — a behemoth that’s scaling skyscrapers in search of helpless Biglaw lawyers and firms it can crush like cockroaches before taking their clients.

And worse yet: there are four of them.

Biglaw, meet Biggerlaw, a group of international apex predators that not only know how to grab market share, but also how to work magic with calculators.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Several weeks ago, PriceWaterhouse Coopers (“PwC”) announced [it was opening its first law firm on US soil](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/business/dealbook/pwc-law-firm-ilc.html). Initially the firm, called ILC Legal, will be staffed with attorneys who focus on multinational companies drawn from the 3,200-strong pool of attorneys that are part of PwC’s network of affiliates. The firm will focus on international law for now, but PwC maintains that there’s nothing to stop it from expanding into other areas in the future, if it sees fit. The firm plans to offer its clients a holistic, business-oriented counsel in keeping with PwC’s larger suite of business strategy services.

The move by PwC is the latest development in a story that most lawyers thought had ended in the early 2000s. [Back in the late 90s](https://thepractice.law.harvard.edu/article/the-reemergence-of-the-big-four-in-law/), the “Big Five” accounting firms (PwC, Ernst & Young, KPMG, Deloitte, and Arthur Andersen) had none-too-quietly been ramping up their networks of affiliated law firms and wholly-owned subsidiaries, and were beginning to directly compete with the biggest of Biglaw firms.

The threat they presented can hardly be overstated. While all of the Big Five were nominally accountancy outfits, specializing in auditing the finances of large companies, each had been branching out for decades into a more generalized practice of business strategy, management, and analysis. They had colossal books of business just itching to be cross-sold to their affiliated law firms. Adding legal services to their mix of offerings just made them even more of a one-stop shop for any large business’s needs. Large law firms, moored in the 19th-century view of their industry that still largely exists today, were struggling mightily to compete. Why send your money to a law firm that can only give you the lawyer’s perspective, when Ernst & Young can get you in the room with a lawyer, a CPA, a tax analyst, and a fleet of business strategists for a comparable price?

The Big Five made aggressive efforts both in the US and abroad to further deregulate the legal industry to allow for more non-traditional legal services companies, to permit fee-sharing with non-attorneys, and other moves that would make them even more competitive with Biglaw.  Everything was poised for a major takeover, until it wasn’t.

And Then There Were Four

When the Enron scandal broke, it directly crashed the Big Five’s efforts to conquer Biglaw. Arthur Andersen was engulfed in scandal and went bankrupt, bringing the Big Five down to the current Big Four. Congress took action and passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which forbade auditing firms from providing non-audit services — like legal practices — to their audit clients. The ABA rejected a number of proposed revisions to the model ethics rules that would have paved the way for the accounting firms to move into the industry. As the Economist reported at the time, [“Accountancy firms’ drive in the legal arena is dead.”](http://www.economist.com/node/2216250)

But as Billy Crystal might say, it turns out they were only [mostly dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbE8E1ez97M). The Big Four scaled back their operations significantly in the wake of Enron and Sarbanes-Oxley, but the dream lived on.  Each of the Big Four firms has redeveloped its legal networks in the last decade, quietly amassing thousands of lawyers that they stand ready to deploy as part of their general business strategy services packages. They’ve expanded aggressively in developing economies throughout Asia and Africa, places that traditional law firms have been slow to move into. Given the current administration’s emphasis on deregulation, it’s not hard to imagine them making a legislative push to force their way into the market, either by repealing Sarbanes-Oxley or loosening restrictions on the ownership of law firms by non-lawyers.

In the meantime, the Big Four will continue to cross-sell their legal services with their non-audit clients, who make up a bigger and bigger cross section of their books of business. They’ll also continue to poach high-value attorneys from the Biglaw world through a combination of high pay, interesting work, and excellent quality of life — every one of the Big Four has been listed for a decade or more as one of Fortune magazine’s [100 Best Companies to Work for](http://fortune.com/best-companies/).

There’s still plenty of time left on the clock, however. As much as the Big Four are trying to take a bite out of Biglaw’s apple by offering legal services, some forward-looking firms have been biting right back, expanding their own services into business consulting, accounting, and strategy.

For example, McDermott Will & Emery spun off a subsidiary called [McDermott+Consulting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/legal-briefs-mcdermott-starts-to-see-payoff-from-lobbying-subsidiary/2014/08/22/11b996aa-28b8-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html).  Focusing on lobbying, strategy, and analytics for the health care industry, they’re going straight at the kinds of non-legal, business-facing services the Big Four would traditionally offer and trying to make it their own. If the pitch for the Big Four is “your business consulting needs, plus law,” McDermott is offering “law, plus all business consulting needs.”

Some firms are looking outside the counselor-client model altogether in their attempts to expand the ways they make money. Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz started a [venture capital fund](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/some_law_firms_travel_outside_law_practice_to_avoid_their_kodak_moment) to invest in legal services providers and develop new technologies for use in the legal industry. Why spend time looking for the best software to serve your clients with when you could just own the software and sell to other attorneys?

The accounting firms have a vast network of clients to sell to, essentially unlimited resources to build their networks and hire away talent, and all the time and patience in the world. The only thing stopping them, for the moment, are regulations that could fall away with the stroke of a pen.

It’s probably just a matter of time before Biglaw and the Big Four are competing fully in the open market. If Biglaw doesn’t up its game, steal a page out of the Big Four’s playbook, and rise to the challenge, it’ll be Biglaw, and not the accountants, that gets written off.

# Billion-Dollar Biglaw Firm Walks Back Its Pandemic Salary Cuts
## Almost everyone will be pleased by this news -- except associates.

COVID-19 has thrown the legal profession into upheaval, but for some firms, the time has come to readjust and reassess the austerity measures that were put into place to prepare for the economic downturn. We’ve already reported on several firms that have announced partial and complete rollbacks on their salary cuts, but we now yet another Biglaw firm is reversing course, and almost everyone at the firm is sure to be thrilled.

Since March, Reed Smith — which raked in $1,246,926,000 in 2019 gross revenue, making it 26th on the Am Law 100 ranking — has announced not one, not two, not three, but FOUR rounds of salary reductions for partners, associates, and staff. First, the firm announced that [partner cash distributions would be slowed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-cuts-back-partner-compensation-amid-covid-19-economic-upheaval/) as a “precaution” to “brac[e] for the short-term and potential long-term economic impacts of COVID-19. A short time later, in mid April, the firm came for associate salaries, announcing [15 percent cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/reed-smith-salary-cuts/) that would last from May through the end of August. About two weeks later, the firm announced that [partner bonuses were being deferred](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/reed-smith-partners-taking-another-covid-19-financial-hit/) and split into separate payments (and the same would happen for staff discretionary bonuses). Then, on June 1, the firm announced that its salary cuts for associates would not only last through the end of the year, but they’d [increase to 20 percent](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-firm-announces-even-deeper-austerity-cuts/). On top of that, staff earning more than $100,000 would take a 10 percent salary hit while other professionals would see reduced workweeks, [reduced salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-firm-announces-even-deeper-austerity-cuts/), and furloughs.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Earlier this week, Sandy Thomas, Reed Smith’s global managing partner, announced that June’s salary cuts, which were originally supposed to last through the end of 2020, would be reduced for some — but not all — those affected, starting in September and lasting through the end of the year. From the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/19/reed-smith-partially-walks-back-pay-cuts-for-lawyers-staff/):

According to his statement, a current 20% compensation cut for fixed-share partners will be reduced to 15% on September 1. For counsel, a current 20% compensation reduction will be reduced to 15% on the same day.

For associates, a current 15% compensation cut will remain at that level. (Previously, the firm planned a 20% cut for September 1, Thomas’s statement said.)

For professional staff earning more than $100,000, a current 10% cut will become a 5% cut.

Everyone gets a break — except for associates, whose reward is that they won’t be forced to endure even bigger pay cuts for the rest of the year. See, we said almost everyone would be thrilled. “Reed Smith has kept its focus on what is most important as we manage through this extraordinary pandemic: protecting the safety and well-being of our people and supporting our clients,” Thomas said. Sorry, associates. This doesn’t seem fair, but always remember: it could be [much worse](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-associates-may-be-getting-paid-less-but-shouldnt-take-their-good-fortune-for-granted/).

Let’s hope more firms are able to roll back COVID-19 austerity measures — and soon.

# The Biglaw Firm That Kicked Off The 2022 Associate Raises Offers A Second Round Of Raises
## No one puts Milbank in a corner.

Biglaw associates — from all firms — owe a big ol’ thank you to Milbank. Way back in January, they were the very first firm to [offer associates raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/), kicking off waves of compensation increases. Sure, [Davis Polk came over](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/) the top of the Milbank numbers for midlevel and senior associates — and then [Cravath came over the top](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) of the DPW scale. But Milbank deserves credit for getting the whole “raise party” started in the first place.

And a firm that leads the Biglaw market like that isn’t about to pay their associates less-than market rates. So, obviously the firm will be matching the highest numbers out there.

The new Milbank scale is as follows:



Like the first round of raises, they are are retroactive to January 1. You can read the full memo [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/milbank-re-raise-22/2/).

Today we are going to explore why [Cravath](https://www.cravath.com/) is (and remains), well, Cravath?  Well, not literally.

Literally, we will explore why the most prestigious Biglaw firms are (and remain) the most prestigious Biglaw firms. And the fact that you knew that by, “Cravath,” I meant “the best of the best,” is telling.

This stickiness has been well documented by master of legal economics, [Bruce MacEwen](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/alt-legal-the-new-law-firm-taxonomy-and-one-thats-doin-it-well/). Bruce’s latest book [Tomorrowland](https://www.amazon.com/Growth-Is-Dead-firms-brink/dp/1481896040) (which simply blew me away), argues that there is an exhausting paradox to law firm prestige:

The firms with the strongest brand names are those deemed to provide the highest quality – and the way you can be assured they’re of exceptional quality is because they have the strongest brands. 

In Part One of this two-part story, we define prestige as it applies to Biglaw (versus the rest of corporate America) and walk through Bruce’s argument for its unique stickiness.

In Part Two, I’m going to sit down with [Itai Gurari](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/itai-gurari/), whose legal research platform, [Judicata](https://www.judicata.com/), seeks to use high technology to cut through the paradox and tell us, once and for all, which Biglaw firm is best.

Eventually, through further explorations in this column, I hope to be able to provide a satisfying answer to your ultimate question: “can my firm ever be Cravath?” If you are too lazy to read on, my quick answer, is probably not today, but maybe in Tomorrowland.

What is Biglaw Prestige?

I Don’t Care to Belong to Any Club That Would Have Me as A Member — Groucho Marx

Mmmmm, delicious prestige.

That manna from heaven we lawyers feast upon to remind ourselves of our self-worth and value. When one works on an all-night doc review, and feels emptiness inside, nothing nourishes the soul like the knowledge of your AmLaw ranking — or profits per partner!

The [Oxford](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/prestige) defines prestige as, “widespread respect and admiration felt for someone or something on the basis of a perception of their achievements or quality, but I’m going to define it as the magical elixir that makes something feel valuable, above and beyond its tangible value.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
At Biglaw, the physical manifestations of prestige are everywhere: dripping from the art on the walls; reflected in the off-white paper and barely-raised lettering on business cards, and broadcast globally through the glossy website. But where does this magical elixir come from? Certainly not from these physical objects and electronic ephemera.

The answer is… wait for it… it depends.

In other industries, prestige flows from smart risk-taking and ingenuity. It’s the rebels who hoard the prestige — the newcomers, the entrepreneurs, and the risk-takers. Ask yourself, is working at Microsoft as cool as working at the newest venture-backed AI startup? (Mom, that question was not for you!). Which of the two jobs would you be more likely to jump ship to, if you had to take a pay cut?

The modern business world doles out prestige for acts of disruption, trendy tee-shirts, and daytime nap pods. In law, prestige flows from polar opposite drivers.

We lawyers value precedent, traditional suits, and not sleeping much at all.  Jokes aside, we love doing what others have done before us, for centuries. We do it because law schools teach us to, because courts require it, and because it works. The best among us leverage established work product and brandish the history and stability of our firm names. We heap pride on those joining the ranks of past legal leaders.

As someone who has worked at, and invested in, half a dozen legal businesses (and technology companies), I have had to have many tough conversations with lawyer-investors who see negative news as a harbinger of inevitable decline. I must remind them that unlike the Biglaw space, what a company is today, is not necessarily what it will become tomorrow.

Why Legal Prestige is Sticky

In the Absence of Facts, The Best Predictor of the Weather Tomorrow is the Weather Today — Tomorrowland

MacEwen’s Tomorrowland walks us through the unique stickiness of legal prestige.

“[T]he ranks of the marquee players,” in Biglaw, including the “New York white shoe elite” and “London’s Magic Circle” have seen only incremental — not seismic — change. And this is in an age where virtually every other industry exists in a constant state of flux. So why are law firms different?

According to MacEwen, elite law firms essentially have two critical functions: grow demand (attracting sophisticated clients) and provide supply (attracting top-tier talent to serve those clients). Most important, to do either, “you need to already have a reputation as an elite firm.”

Want proof? MacEwen contrasts two tables showing the top-10 firms from the [Vault prestige rankings](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/vault-law-100/) from 2006 and 2017 respectively.

1	Wachtell	Cravath
2	Cravath	Wachtell
3	Sullivan & Cromwell	Skadden
4	Skadden	Sullivan & Cromwell
5	Davis Polk	Davis Polk
6	Simpson Thatcher	Simpson Thatcher
7	Latham	Latham
8	Cleary	Kirkland
9	Weil Gotshal	Cleary
10	Covington	Gibson Dunn
Then, he compares the Biglaw list to Global Brands generally (see [Interbrands](http://interbrand.com/)):

1	Coca-Cola	Apple
2	Microsoft	Google
3	IBM	Coca-Cola
4	GE	Microsoft
5	Intel	Toyota
6	Nokia	IBM
7	Toyota	Samsung
8	Disney	Amazon
9	McDonald’s	Mercedes-Benz
10	Mercedes-Benz	GE
MacEwen argues, persuasively, the difference between the legal and non-legal lists are vast and meaningful:

To be sure, six [non-legal] brands make both lists, but four change. Intel, Nokia, Disney and McDonald’s fall away and Apple, Google, Samsung and Amazon appear. Perhaps more surprising is where the new 2016 names were in 2006:  Samsung was 20th, Google 24th, Apple 39th, and Amazon 65th. Imagine a law firm in the gang of 60-69 as of 2006 vaulting into the top ten a decade later: Inconceivable.

Why is it “inconceivable” that a firm ranked 60-69 would vault into the top ten? Because “to get into the inner circle, you need to be in the inner circle.”

So now I ask you, dear readers, does this make you mad? It should. In theory, someone with legal, business and management skills should be able to go out there, do great work, build a great team and change the law firm industry in one generation (like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg have done for, books, media, retail, and, well… most industries!).

But the facts on the ground say this isn’t realistic over the period of time one can expect to practice (though we are living longer than ever!). Is there any potential for relief? Can the next Biglaw Bezos have any realistic hope to best Cravath at their well-played game?

Preview of Part II:  Technology Upends the Status Quo? Judicata’s Trying

To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. — Mark Twain

Tech, tech, tech. So I have been thinking for a while about how technology could provide an objective measure of legal work-quality, which could make the law firm industry more dynamic — and upend the stickiness of law firm prestige.

Well, Judicata, is working to do just that. To whet your appetite, enjoy a preview of next month’s talk with Judicata CEO, [Itai Gurari](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/itai-gurari/):

I see [law firm prestige] as a parallel to Newton’s first law of motion: a body in motion will remain in motion unless it is acted upon by an external force.

A prestigious law firm will remain prestigious unless it is acted upon by an external force. A law firm is prestigious today because it was prestigious last year. It was prestigious last year because it was prestigious the year before.

But richer data and more advanced technology are splintering that continuity. Just as we’ve seen with other fields, I think objectivity is taking hold, and that shift will lead to a changing of the guard.

More on this and Judicata in my next alt.legal! Also, I have new contact info, so if you have alt.legal story ideas, check out my new footer below.

# Global Firm Irks Associates With Subpar Salary Announcement
## Is this a sign of trouble for the firm?

Few firms elicited as much associate angst as Norton Rose Fulbright. [We kept hearing](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/days-go-by-and-associates-keep-getting-angrier/) from associates as the rest of the Houston market scrambled to match Cravath’s New York salary and Norton Rose just sat there. Given [the tangible revenue hit they’ve taken over Brexit](https://store.law.com/Registration/Login.aspx?mode=silent&refDomain=store.legalweek.com&source=http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2016/06/29/norton-rose-fulbright-sees-global-revenues-dip-as-currency-fluctuations-hit-top-line/%3Fslreturn%3D20160601113241), one wondered if the verein could even pull off the raise.

But now Norton Rose Fulbright has joined the salary raise game… and associates aren’t too happy:

Fulbright has had weeks to do the right thing (and lots of examples of firms that have not). After radio silence for weeks, they did the absolute bare minimum shamelessly only announcing salary raises for first years STARTING IN OCTOBER. Disgustingly transparent. This is worse than radio silence.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Apparently telling associates [they won’t get paid until October](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/remember-that-raise-we-told-you-about-we-have-some-bad-news/) on the very day most Biglaw associates get their raises is the new hotness in Biglaw management.

The full memo from U.S. managing partner [Linda Addison](http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/people/90633/lindaladdison) (available on the next page) advises associates to address questions to their practice group leader or “Sue Manch, Chief of People,” which is the coolest Biglaw title ever!

Here’s the sort of complaint I’m pretty sure Chief Manch of the People is hearing right now…

Wtf? Associates are furious, clearly they just want to save face at OCI and are unconcerned about associate retention in the meantime

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Or maybe this one…

Norton Rose Fulbright raises first year salaries to $180K…says will announce higher class years at a later date and not effective until October 1…..they are probably going to screw upper level associates.

So clearly it doesn’t seem like they are matching the cravath scale….I expect people will start looking for other options since this isn’t exactly the best news on top of the horrible optics of delaying any word of raises until today.

The “upper-level” compression is becoming more and more prevalent as we go further into the summer. Coupled with an October effective date, this is some depressing news to get if you look across the market. Maybe this is all a temporary symptom of recent economic events. Maybe? Hopefully?

Still, the most interesting subplot of “Late-Stage Cravathism” is what we’re all learning about these firms. This is a drawn out poker game and every time one of these firms stiffs an associate or pushes off raises for months on end, it’s becoming increasingly clear who’s sitting on pocket Aces and who’s really hoping to get out of the hand alive.

And in a year or so, we might find out who was bluffing too.

# Junior Lawyers Are Going Extinct And Nobody Knows What To Do About It
## Technology will reduce the market for junior attorneys and that carries with it some significant ripple effects.

Every time I’m asked to comment on the impact technology will have on the legal profession, I always focus on the same problem: the death of the junior attorney. Robots are not replacing elite litigators any time soon, but what they will do is grease the wheels of the legal process and alleviate all the mindless grind that typically occupies junior associates.

And that’s a problem for the profession because law firms and law schools have partnered to pawn off all actual professional training to the firms and when those firms start hiring fewer junior attorneys, that means there are fewer lawyers entering the cursus honorum to learn how to be the next generation of elite senior lawyers. Nothing is being done to address this looming disaster.

Professor John Flood of Griffith University in Queensland, Australia [also sees this danger](https://www.legalcheek.com/2019/01/junior-lawyers-endangered-species-due-to-automation-law-prof-claims/). In a new academic paper titled, “Legal Professionals of the Future: Their Ethos, Role and Skills,” he writes:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The effect of automation here could be dramatic in that if junior associates were to be gradually culled from firms, the entire reproduction of the legal profession could be jeopardised since law firms are structured around associates being promoted to partnership…

Exactly. Sooner rather than later, firms are going to slow their junior hiring and focus on a narrower range of candidates. Unfortunately, the path to building a great lawyer is a pyramid scheme and it’s harder to guarantee good results when there are less bodies in the system getting tested for their professional acumen.

Moreover, screwing up the most basic tasks is a critical part of becoming a well-seasoned attorney. What happens when we lose those tasks to throw at a first-year? What replaces that hands-on education?

Legal Cheek cites a Law Society study that estimates:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Over the longer term, the number of jobs in the legal services sector will be increasingly affected by automation of legal services functions. This could mean that by 2038 total employment in the sector could be 20% less than it would otherwise have been, with a loss of 78,000 jobs — equal to 67,000 full-time equivalent jobs — compared to if productivity growth continued at its current rate.

Gloom and doom over unemployment is usually misplaced. Jobs tend to just get shifted — more firm lawyers become freelance attorneys or join non-traditional legal services companies, for example. But if the training regime for young lawyers isn’t addressed, the population of competent attorneys to fill these new gigs will simply dry up.

Firms and law schools need to start taking this challenge seriously because life comes at you fast, and the profession could face its existential crisis sooner than folks realize.

# What To Do When You're Tired Of Waiting For The Perfect Job

Two of my millennial women lawyer friends have had epiphanies that I think are worth sharing.

For most of her young career as a lawyer (e.g. less than six years), Ms. A sought to get a job in Biglaw, thinking that such was the way to success. Friends warned her that she wouldn’t necessarily get the mentoring and training she wanted. After angst-ridden times, it turned out that she didn’t get a Biglaw job. Friends fretted that she was so focused on getting a toehold in Biglaw that she wasn’t able to see benefits in non-Biglaw. Now she does.

Ms. B wanted a government job with the ostensible benefits it would provide. She didn’t get it; she wasn’t devastated, and now she’s carving out a very nice niche practice for herself.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The hand-wringing about the continuing [lack of diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/diversity-in-the-legal-profession-the-more-things-change-the-more-they-stay-the-same-until-they-dont/) in the profession, goes on. Diversity in the legal profession is dreadful, and we should be ashamed of ourselves. We suck at diversity.

I think these two women, among thousands of others (probably way more than that), have now taken their career fates in their own hands, not leaving them to the whims of others. While there has been some diversity progress in the last forty years since I was admitted to the bar, the pace is still glacially slow, and women and minority lawyers are tired of being told, “just wait, it’s getting better.” Please. (Dinosaurs, remember the Kinks song of the 1960s, “[Tired of Waiting for You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRwleQ4pnrM)“?)

For many women lawyers, especially millennials, their responses are that they’re tired of waiting, and they’ll make things happen on their own terms, rather than waiting for purported largesse from those on high. These days, given the miserable rate at which women become equity partners coupled with less compensation than male counterparts, [why go that route](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/can-women-lawyers-ever-find-equality-in-biglaw/)? 

It should be no surprise that Altman Weil’s 2017 [Law Firms In Transition Survey ](http://www.altmanweil.com//dir_docs/resource/90D6291D-AB28-4DFD-AC15-DBDEA6C31BE9_document.pdf)found more than half of the firms report that their equity partners are not sufficiently busy, and almost two-thirds of the firms report that their non-equity partners are not busy enough. In a quarter of the firms, even associates don’t have full workloads.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.

In other words, oversupply meets underdemand. The sharing economy doesn’t seem to have a place in law firms in these days of “you eat what you kill.”

More than four out of five firm leaders surveyed say they have chronically underperforming lawyers. Underperforming can take different forms, but more than eighty percent point to “weak business development skills and efforts” as reasons.

Just blame the victim here. You tell me how many lawyers graduated law school with marketing degrees alongside the J.D. You tell me how many firms provide younger lawyers with training in business development, and what that consists of. You tell me how many partners take younger lawyers to lunch with existing clients and then spend the entire meal monopolizing the conversation. How many partners take younger lawyers to lunch with prospects and it’s the same scenario? Since more than half the senior lawyers are not sufficiently busy, at least according to this survey, how can younger lawyers develop business if others won’t let it go? How are younger lawyers supposed to learn business development unless and until they’re given tools with which to work?

The survey notes that almost three quarters of the firms are investing more in business development, but it’s ranked as the least effective method of improving profitability. However, most firms recognize that the fruits from business development take time (duh), but in this era of instant gratification, patience doesn’t seem to be a virtue.

Nowadays, the pressure to bill the hours while simultaneously doing business development, speaking, writing, networking (I still hate that term), let alone include a concept of work-life balance, is turning many younger and newbie lawyers away. Yes, Biglaw can pay the bills and give you the get out of student loan jail card, but at what cost?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The Altman Weil survey noted that the former stigma attached to the use of contract lawyers, staff lawyers, and part-time lawyers is pretty much a thing of the past. It’s about time. Not every lawyer wants to bill 2000 hours a year, and so flexibility, especially to millennial lawyers, and even some dinosaurs, is desirable.

In the category of “being careful what you wish for,” there’s been much trumpeting and self-congratulatory pats on the back about lateral acquisitions. However, to use a dinosaurial expression, the proof is in the pudding. The survey points out that while the number one approach that firms are using to increase profitability is lateral hiring, only about half of the firms using that approach have seen significant increases in profit improvement.

The big bugaboo is resistance to change. Trying to change lawyer behavior is like trying to get the Titanic to avoid that iceberg. Lawyers are not known for embracing practice changes, and so, the survey notes that law firms are still slow to make changes to increase the efficient delivery of legal services. Two-thirds of the law firm leaders say their partners resist most change efforts, and more than half say their partners are unaware of what they might do differently. So much for lawyers being the smartest people in the room.

As Bill Henderson notes in his blog, [Legal Evolution](http://www.legalevolution.org/2017/05/supply-law-graduates-shrinking-demand-006/), the biggest problem facing both the profession and legal education is stagnant productivity. He is spot on.

I think it’s a no-brainer to figure out why change is anathema. Anything that reduces income to the firm is bound to cause foot-dragging.

For lawyers who wanted Biglaw jobs and didn’t get them, they should take heart from the survey, as I think it is good news for lawyers, in whatever size firm, who are innovative, embrace change, and care about efficiencies in service delivery.

Not every lawyer has the same aspirations, the same goals; one size definitely does not fit all. Be tired of waiting. Don’t be afraid to innovate, change things up, and ignore the choruses of “it’s always been done it this way.” So what?

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Top 10 Am Law Firm Lays Off 4 Percent Of Americas-Based Business Services Staff

It’s long been a trend for Biglaw firms to reduce the amount of staff that is needed to support attorneys, but the economic upheaval of the coronavirus crisis seems to have supercharged the issue. This fall, many firms have restructured and rightsized their ranks, and the latest to slash its staff headcount is Hogan Lovells.

With $2,246,050,000 gross revenue in 2019, the firm came in 8th place on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. But despite this huge sum, the firm is moving ahead with layoffs among its business services staff in the U.S. and Mexico, acknowledging that “the pandemic has played a role.” According to a memo from Richard Lorenzo, regional managing partner of the Americas, and Michael Davison, the firm’s deputy CEO, 43 employees will be impacted by the layoffs, “representing around 4% of Americas-based Business Services employees.” All those affected will receive severance packages that “recognize[] the realities of the current market.”

Lorenzo and Davison go on to note that there are “no plans for any further reductions at this point.” Best of luck to all those who are affected by the layoffs at Hogan Lovells.

Katherine Magbanua (Broward County Sheriff’s Office)

The wheels of justice may turn slowly but they’re still turning. Some eight years after law professor Dan Markel was assassinated in his driveway, Katharine Magbanua received a life sentence plus 60 years for her role in his killing.

The two men who killed Markel were captured in 2016, with one of the gunmen telling authorities that the pair were hired to perform the murder because “the lady wants her two kids back.” Markel and ex-wife Wendi Adelson were in a custody dispute at the time over her desire to uproot the children from Tallahassee, where Markel was teaching at FSU Law, to South Florida. Wendi did move the kids after Markel’s murder.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Prosecutors successfully argued that Magbanua was involved in hiring her ex-boyfriend, Sigfredo Garcia, and his friend to act as the hitmen. She was dating Wendi Adelson’s brother Charlie at the time of the slaying. Charlie Adelson was arrested earlier this year after law enforcement reported that technological advances finally unlocked surveillance audio of Adelson and Magbanua that used to be too garbled to make out.

Gibson Dunn’s Orin Snyder and Matt Benjamin, representing the Markel family, released the following statement:

Dan Markel was brutally murdered more than eight years ago. Today’s sentencing of Katharine Magbanua marks another important step toward accountability and justice. We are grateful for the efforts of law enforcement and the State Attorney’s Office in advancing the criminal case against Charles Adelson and in continuing to pursue all those responsible for Dan’s murder.

For her part, Magbanua’s attorney Tara Kawass read a statement explaining that Magbanua “wants each and every person who had a hand in this and knows something about this to be brought to justice.” That suggests quite the shift after years of not cooperating with authorities. With Charlie Adelson facing trial down the road, Magbanua could be testifying again in the near future.

At the risk of reading too much into it, her words also indicate that there are both people with “a hand in this” and people who “know something about this” still out there, lending credence to longstanding speculation that the case against Charlie Adelson won’t allege that he “went rogue” but had support or at least encouragement from others.

Adelson’s trial is not set yet, but prosecutors are hopeful to have a trial in January, February, or March of 2023.

# More Evidence That Biglaw Equity Partners Really Are A Dying Breed
## Plus, the Am Law 100 firms that recently added nonequity partners to their roster.

According to data collected for the 2019 Am Law 100, which Am Law 100 firms only have equity partners?

Hint: [Last year’s](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/if-youre-hoping-to-make-partner-these-biglaw-firms-will-treat-you-right/) list of firms with only one tier of partner had 18 firms on it. This year’s list only has 16.

# Ranking The Top Law Firms In The Country -- A Difficult Endeavor
## Law360 Pulse combines three different rankings and ends up with something less than the sum of its parts.

Everyone wants a grand unified theory and rankings are no exception. We can capture a lot of important insights in nuanced, targeted rankings, but there’s something viscerally appealing about one ranking to rule them all.

Law360’s bid to create a definitive law firm ranking borrows from prior specialized rankings, giving one-third weight to each of three independent rankings. The thing is, those independent rankings all provided key insights for potential clients or prospective firm hires to weigh.

They didn’t need to be merged. In fact, Law360’s introductory remarks to this ranking recognize this:

What makes a firm the first one clients turn to for just about any high-stakes legal matter?

There’s no one answer to that question.

True! But Law360 opted to combine its prior rankings and delivered a result that doesn’t accomplish the sort of definitive scorecard they probably wanted.

The first pillar of the new ranking is firm prestige, is based on the [Law360 Pulse Prestige Leaders ranking](https://www.law360.com/articles/1443593/the-2021-law360-pulse-prestige-leaders), which [we covered back in December](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/the-most-prestigious-biglaw-firms-in-the-country/). The most prestigious firms were Kirkland, Latham, and Davis Polk, which sounded reasonable.

The second prong of the ranking is the social impact pillar based on its [Social Impact Leaders](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1428803) ranking, which [we covered here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/you-can-do-good-in-biglaw-these-firms-show-how-it-can-be-done/). That ranking awarded top honors to Covington, Orrick, and WilmerHale.

The third input to these new rankings is an all-new ranking based on data gathered by Lex Machina and Intelligize over a three-year period geographic reach in litigation, litigation depth and breadth, completed public deal value, and completed offerings value. The litigation figures are culled by Lex Machina and reflect the number of federal court districts where the firm appeared and percentile-ranked in 10 case types to assess firms’ relative activity in a diverse array of subjects. The transactional component based on Intelligize data uses the total value of all public mergers or acquisitions with a disclosed value of $1 million or more and the total value of all completed registered offerings.

Put together, this is Law360 Pulse’s Law Firm Leaderboard top ten:

1. Covington
2. Morgan Lewis
3. Cooley
4. Sidley Austin
5. Arnold & Porter
6. O’Melveny
7. WilmerHale
8. Orrick
9. Morrison & Foerster
10. Hogan Lovells

A curious list. [Check out the top 100 here](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1448829).

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Digging into the numbers, it seems as though firms that one might expect to see atop any kind of leaderboard — firms like Cravath, Skadden, or White & Case, all tumbled because Law360 lacked data for its social impact score. That the top three in that ranking all appear in the top 10 of the overall ranking demonstrates how much influence this figure had on the final ratings.

In fact, 22 of the top 100 didn’t have a social impact score. On the one hand, if firms think it’s acceptable to blow off the social data, they should feel some shame. The social impact score includes racial and gender diversity figures, which clients are finally starting to prioritize in selecting counsel. But on the other hand, if almost a quarter of the field is sporting a “No data” score on one-third of the assignment, the whole ranking suffers.

And the new litigation impact score has issues as well.

While “global” and “national” are great branding terms, I’m not sure it enhances anyone’s view of firm prestige to learn that they also filed in Topeka last year. It seems as though the ranking could include some sort of scoring that weights appearances in districts based on that district’s share of impact litigation. A firm that plays as well in the SDNY as it does in Los Angeles and DC would be more valuable information than knowing it appeared in 40 different, but ultimately less high impact, districts.

Hopefully this new ranking will inspire more folks to check out — and more firms to contribute to — the earlier rankings, because there’s a lot of useful data in there. But as a grand unified ranking, this leaderboard leaves a bit to be desired.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to an Above the Law survey of almost 400 attorneys and staff members across hundreds of Biglaw and boutique law firms, what percentage of respondents said their overall compensation did NOT reflect their contribution to their firm?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Hint: As one respondent noted, “They repeatedly tell us how much they care about our self-actualization, mental health, etc., but their compensation and treatment of “counsel” is hidden from scrutiny, unlike its compensation and treatment of associates, where everything is about keeping up with other top-tier law firms, and because how they treat us is hidden, they treat us very unfairly, and often reprehensibly.”

# Biglaw Firm's Group Lateral Hire Results In Closure Of Nearly 50-Year-Old Boutique
## This is the Biglaw firm's fourth group lateral hire in 2024 alone.

Group lateral moves are still all the rage in Biglaw, and Fennemore Craig ought to know — the Am Law 200 firm just gobbled up its fourth group of laterals in 2024, and this time, a firm is closing its doors as a result of the move.

Denver-based Moye White will be winding down its business now that the majority of its employees — some 50 lawyer and 30 staff members — have chosen to head to Fennemore. The group is expected to start at the Biglaw firm in mid-April, while their former firm, which was nearly 50 years old, takes the rest of the year to close up shop.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/04/01/after-47-years-denvers-moye-white-to-wind-down-after-most-lawyers-join-fennemore-craig/) has additional details on the transaction:

[Fennemore CEO James] Goodnow said he expects Moye White to add close to $30 million in annualized revenue to Fennemore. Fennemore, which is headquartered in Phoenix, experienced a 5.7% increase in revenue in 2023 to $143.2 million, according to data compiled by The American Lawyer. …

“We’ve found this mass lateral hiring works depending on the situation,” Goodnow said. “It’s a very clean way to do a transaction. You don’t have to worry about the complexities of integrating financial or technology systems.”

Unfortunately, not all Moye White employees received offers to move to Fennemore. “We certainly wish everyone, whether on the lawyer or staff side, all of them the best,” Goodnow said. “We don’t take the human side of this lightly.”

Congratulations to Fennemore Craig on yet another acquisition, and best of luck to almost everyone from Moye White who will soon be integrated into the larger firm.

# Kirkland & Ellis Associates Sending The Help To Buy Dog Shoes
## This isn't so much a perk as a pair of handcuffs attached to your keyboard.

When people think of law firm perks, they usually think of unlimited vacation or
programs that let associates work from home. Kirkland & Ellis is high on its concierge service as its killer perk. The service, run by [Circles by Sodexo](https://us.sodexo.com/services/concierge-services.htmll), allows associates to work with [a full-time concierge for free](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherelliott/2019/07/21/this-is-what-happens-when-lawyers-get-a-concierge/#4f2776bc4549).

It certainly sounds like a time-saver to have someone running errands for busy attorneys. That used to be a job that administrative professionals could do, but as firms have slashed their staff rosters in an effort to squeeze even more profit out of the enterprise, it’s a task that’s getting outsourced.

“It’s great that companies are acknowledging that employees want to both work hard and maximize their time at work and have stress-free fun and maximize their time outside of work,” [K&E’s Samuel Zaertsky] says. “On-site concierge services enhance both worlds.”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

And that’s just it, isn’t it? This is less of a perk than a passive-aggressive effort to remove any possible excuse an associate might have not to be at their desk at any given moment. This is one of those gifts that’s really more for the gift-giver than the receiver. Still, the service does free up a lot of time for people if they know how to use it. Let’s check out some of the services they’ve been using it on:

One attorney was away from home on his daughter’s third birthday, working on a trial. He requested a specific bicycle for her gift. The concierge bought it, arranged for it to be assembled, and delivered it on on her birthday.

This is going to be a terrific story for this little girl to tell her therapist someday about why she’s unable to love. On the other hand, this process produced a more sturdy bicycle than entrusting a lawyer with a screwdriver would.

The concierge also found a Christmas tree for an attorney who was visiting friends in London and had it delivered to the apartment door, along with a Christmas tree stand.

Nothing really expresses the Chirstmas spirit quite like having a stranger buy you a tree and unceremoniously drop it on the doorstep.

Another attorney asked the concierge to buy two pairs of dog booties for her two dogs. After extensive research, the Kirkland concierge found a store that still had dog booties in stock in the middle of a winter storm.

So poor Bob Cratchit just wants to go home, but Elle Woods here had him trudging through a blizzard to buy shoes for whatever perversion of evolution rat dogs she keeps around the house to replace human connections.

Kirkland & Ellis is in real trouble if the guillotines return.

Maybe I lived it; maybe I dreamed it.  I surely can’t say here.

When I worked at a law firm, to the person in the office next door:

“Good morning.”

“Good morning.  Can I have a client number for that?”

“Excuse me?”

“I’m rounding up to the nearest six minutes.”

When I worked at a law firm, to a heavy-hitter:

“Are you charging for that?”

“It’s one hour to L120, Analysis.”

“How do you figure?”

“I know the rules say that we bill in six-minute increments.  But I don’t do that; it’s too much trouble.  I bill in hour increments.  And I don’t worry about task codes.  All I do is analyze stuff, so it’s all L120, Analysis.”

Our counsel recommending how much we should pay in settlement:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We must win on two issues to win this case.  I figure we have a one in three chance of winning on the first issue.  And we have a one in three chance of winning on the second issue.  So we have about a one in four chance of winning the case.”

“Are the issues independent?”

“Completely.”

“If the issues are independent, and we have a one in three chance of winning each of them, then we have a one in nine chance of winning the case.”

“I’m not trying to be mathematically precise.  I’m just saying how likely it is we’ll win the case.”

In internal communications:

“Finance sent you the attached email (and copied me) last week.  I haven’t yet seen your answer go out.  Could you send me a copy of what you sent to Finance?”

“I figure I’ll have a precise answer in six weeks.  I’ll answer the email then.”

“Don’t you think it would be a good idea to tell Finance that you don’t yet know the answer to the question, that you’ll know the answer in six weeks, and that you’ll respond then?  Or do you prefer to have people in Finance saying that the Law Department doesn’t answer emails?”

On the value of the case:

“It has a settlement value of about $5 million today, and it’ll be worth about $10 million as trial approaches.”

“Why’s that?”

“Cases are always worth more as trial approaches.”

On preparing a settlement memo:

“This memo is going to Mr. Big.  You get three paragraphs to describe the case.”

“That’s not possible.  My case is much too complicated.  It can’t be described in three paragraphs.”

“I’ve worked here for 10 years.  Every settlement memo I’ve ever sent to Mr. Big has been three paragraphs long.  Do you really think yours is the first case in the history of our firm that can’t be described in three paragraphs?”

“Yes.  My case is too complicated.”

Discussing settlement:

“Last year, you said the case was worth $1 million.”

“Yes.”

“But now you’re asking for $2 million.”

“Yes.”

“What’s happened in the last year that’s doubled the value of the case?”

“The compensation methodology is much too complicated to explain.  I can’t tell you why the value of the case has doubled.”

It’s enough to make you give up sleeping, for fear of more nightmares.

# Playing Career Jeopardy
## How many admonishments is one judge permitted?

It’s not often you read about a lawyer willingly playing the game with his career. One attorney, a member (but not for much longer) of the D.C. bar urged the Office of the D.C. Disciplinary Counsel to disbar him. (Talk about being proactive.) How many times have you seen an attorney in trouble with the bar actively ask for disbarment? Rather than throwing himself on the mercy of the disciplinary counsel, Glenn Stephens III threw himself under the bus, by requesting that he be disbarred. The D.C Court of Appeals Board on Professional Responsibility [granted his request](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/in-epic-reverse-psychology-fail-lawyer-said-please-disbar-me-and-so-they-did/) by issuing an OSC why he should not be disbarred.

Meanwhile, here in La La land, Tom Girardi, the plaintiff’s lawyer in a world of hurt who is temporarily conserved and in bankruptcy, offered to resign from the bar. However, the State Bar said not so fast since disciplinary charges are pending, including misappropriation of client funds. A [report from the Chapter 7 trustee](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2021/04/06/girardi-keese-bankruptcy-trustee-says-at-least-15m-in-client-funds-are-missing/?kw=Girardi%20Keese%20Bankruptcy%20Trustee%20Says%20at%20Least%20%2415M%20in%20Client%20Funds%20Are%20Missing&utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_campaign=newsupdate&utm_content=20210407&utm_term=ca&slreturn=20210307142633) says that between $15 million and $20 million cannot be accounted for, and she’s not done yet.

In another example of career jeopardy, the California Commission on Judicial Performance has publicly admonished Patrick E. Connolly, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge for, in essence, [not playing nice](https://cjp.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2021/04/Connolly_DO_Pub_Adm_4-2-2021.pdf).

One of the instances arose at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic when two defense attorneys requested to appear telephonically rather than in person. (Remember a year ago when things were at sixes and sevens for courts trying to figure out the best way to handle criminal matters which have statutory time requirements?) While they were permitted to appear telephonically, due to the stay-at-home order and that one counsel was showing COVID-19 symptoms, Connolly was irritated and impatient with the two counsel.

During the hearing, the court mentioned on four separate occasions that one of the counsel had not appeared in court for the hearing. The commission found that there was no justification for the judge’s impatience and irritation and found that the judge’s demeanor violated the judicial canon of ethics.

In another criminal case, after a jury had acquitted the defendant of the charge, Connolly commented to the acquitted defendant that there was no doubt in the court’s mind that the defendant was guilty of the charge. Thank you, your honor, for sharing. The commission found the judge’s remarks to be “gratuitous, undignified and improper,” also violating the canons of judicial ethics.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

This was not the judge’s first rodeo, as he had been previously publicly admonished a few years before, and before that, he had received a private admonishment. How many admonishments is one judge permitted?

So, let’s play Jeopardy!, the TV game show version. What’s the Final Jeopardy question to this answer: atelophobia? The correct question is “What is fear of imperfection?”

I had never heard the term before. Lots of lawyers (and others) suffer from it. The fear of not being perfect is a trait that many lawyers share and which can be the downfall of many of us. Mistakes happen. Last time I checked, we are still human, although AI is stalking us.

While the phobia is extreme perfectionism, it shows up in many facets of our working and personal lives. It’s the fear of making a mistake that can be so extreme that it deters us from doing anything, for fear of doing it wrong. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?

The symptoms can be any emotional distress. Let’s name a few: worrying about whether the statute of limitations has run on a particular matter; worrying about whether the brief you submitted on a critical issue is perfect, worrying about whether the jurors chosen in a particular case don’t like you or your client, perseverating to the nth degree about anything and everything that lawyers tend to worry about. Worrying about being sued for malpractice, [no matter how remote](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/atelophobia) the possibility.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

This is where self-medication often kicks in: the drinking, the use of substances to get through the day, the week, the month, the year. This phobia is different from the fear of failure, another phobia that we have.

The perfectionism phobia often is the result of upbringing and other environmental factors that play upon a person’s insecurity and fears. If you were raised in an environment where A grades were expected and anything lower than that met with disapproval, that could be a trigger for adult behavior where anything less than perfection is unacceptable.

It’s also possible that you are “hardwired” for this phobia. Are you sensitive? Insecure? Two traits that are tough to handle as a lawyer. How many times have you revised a brief? It’s easier nowadays to do that than it was in dinosaur times, but the facility with which revisions can be made don’t necessarily justify endless revisions. Stressing out over a typo or a word choice should not be the end of the world or cause you to fall into a funk or depression because the work wasn’t perfect. Been there.

Do you procrastinate? Another sign of perfectionism. You don’t want to do a less than perfect job, so what do you do? You do nothing, and that gets you into trouble when work isn’t finished on time.

Learning how to let go, to stop worrying about never being good enough (although I wonder whose definition of “good enough” is “good enough,”) stopping the voices in your head that constantly natter about your need to improve is essential, not just for the practice of law specifically, but in your life in general.

We struggle with alcohol use, depression, and anxiety [more so than the general population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4736291/). I know lawyers (and other professionals) who proclaim their perfectionism as a badge of honor. I disagree.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.
