ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

Laterals, law students, and clients should take note on what this firm is up to.

Firms are still sending out bonus announcements and on an otherwise sleepy Friday, one more global heavy informed its associates that they’ll follow Milbank’s bonus scale. It’s not a tremendous surprise to see White & Case join the pack in paying the prevailing bonus. The firm is a top ten Am Law outfit and it’s not going to forfeit the talent acquisition race to its peers by skimping on associate compensation.

We’ve not yet seen a memo, but our tipsters told us the announcement matches the market so let’s just remind everyone what the market’s been doing:

Class of 2019 – $15,000 (prorated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012 and senior – $100,000

I haven’t been out with the protesters. You know I am old, which automatically puts me in the high-risk category. Plus, I have an autoimmune disorder … Strike Two! If I put a knee down for even a minute, it would be ugly. Getting old is not for sissies, but at least I have had the chance to grow old, which is more than can be said for George Floyd.

If you have ever read any of my rants on diversity and inclusion — and there have been a fair number of those over the years — now is the time to redouble our profession’s efforts. We have not been at the forefront. I don’t care what other professions or businesses have done or not done. I care about what we, as lawyers, have done and have not done. Does anyone else see the irony that a profession purportedly dedicated to justice and fairness has been dragging its heels on making us look more like what this country and certainly my state look like?

These two examples show we have a long way to go: this [Wisconsin lawyer](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/attorney-arrested-not-once-but-twice-after-allegedly-spitting-in-black-teenagers-face/) needs a refresher in common courtesy to both protesters and police these days. The lawyer should pay for coronavirus test for the protester. Spitting at someone is never cool, especially now. Disciplinary charges are pending, as well they should.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

Remember “sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me?” Au contraire. Which is worse? Spitting and assaulting or lawyers who think that words [never hurt](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/attorney-calls-george-floyd-a-shtstain-and-other-awful-things-lawyers-are-doing-right-now/)? What is wrong with us? I know we’re only a microcosm of the society at large, but really?

It’s not just diversifying legal practice but legal tech as well. As Bob Ambrogi notes in his blog, one aspect to increasing diversity is for consumers to buy products from diverse vendors, not just the same old, same old. It’s not different really than trying to get that first break in whatever career or trying to become a member of a union that requires a certain number of gigs before membership. Sometimes that [first break](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/toward-increasing-diversity-in-legal-tech/) is all that is needed. We all had one, didn’t we? Or if we didn’t, we should have had.

It’s no different in the legal profession. It’s an opportunity, the hand up that allows people the chance to show what they can do. How will COVID-19 affect efforts to diversify the profession? Since the profession’s response so far to diversity and inclusion efforts has been “meh,” I wonder if the pandemic will give the profession cover to not increase those efforts.

As if this is any indication, African-American applicants to law school [are down](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/law-school-applications-by-black-people-are-down-this-year/?utm_campaign=ATL%20Weekly&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=89134300&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--TrFRnePtkdblrI2mYulaTblND0MqKtixJnqe0FIRYG0I7GtJ42cq7RW5UtOhujW3VqnNrHg8qgjLnJPbOM6Y698Yq3w&utm_content=89134300&utm_source=hs_email).

This is not what we should want to see.

Even when African-Americans pass the bar, they don’t have the same [career opportunities](https://www.law.com/2020/06/03/it-could-have-been-me-black-attorneys-reflect-on-george-floyds-death-and-what-comes-next/) or opportunities for advancement. Black attorneys make up less than four percent of the lawyers in Biglaw, and barely over two percent of partners in the AmLaw 200. African-Americans compose 13 percent of the general population.

We lawyers speak out against injustice for our clients, arguing (or blustering or whining, whatever works) something is unjust or unfair. But we don’t seem to have much of a voice when it comes to diversity and inclusion. Why is that? And please don’t tell me it’s the clients that drive the decision as to who staffs a case. That should be our call, not the clients, but we often wimp out because it’s a “good client” that we don’t want to lose.

General counsel must share in that [metaphorical knee](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-partner-calls-out-gcs-for-failing-black-lawyers-careers/) to the neck. Donald Prophete’s opinion is [worth the read](https://www.law.com/2020/06/08/call-to-gcs-what-are-you-prepared-to-do-to-prevent-the-endemic-asphyxiation-of-black-legal-careers/).

So, it’s one thing to call for change, but it’s another thing altogether to make change happen? How do we do that? How do we improve our profession so that it looks more like this country demographically? How do we increase the pipeline of African-Americans who want to become lawyers but find barriers [at every turn](https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/law-admissions-lowdown/articles/what-underrepresented-law-school-applicants-should-know)?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The experiences of a female African-American associate at a Biglaw firm explain how [difficult professional life](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/on-being-a-black-american-biglaw-associate/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=89035469&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--F3IeG2FlqBsDjK8P8eLyKTY27BG8xMOWV5e2voFZVySTo_G97oI8K-PZX0CvRV0lzN6fmqigck-KtHB4bSO3jQxsmLw&utm_content=89035469&utm_source=hs_email) can be.

Women associates have a hard-enough time, but layer on the additional factor of being black, and it’s much worse.

Corporate America promises to do better, but that’s been heard before, again and again, ad nauseam. As a recent article in the New York Times pointed out, it’s not just criminal justice that needs attention, but economic justice. [Whatever happened](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/business/corporate-america-has-failed-black-america.html?campaign_id=4&emc=edit_dk_20200608&instance_id=19179&nl=dealbook&regi_id=78061995&segment_id=30346&te=1&user_id=0d22f8d038b2fef3184a5c3bba481c1c) to the Occupy movement a decade ago protesting economic inequality?

Biglaw has trumpeted its commitment to racial justice, to stamping out racism. ATL has collected statements from approximately [60 law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/). So, how will those words translate into action a year or two from now? Will the needle have risen on the number of black lawyers in Biglaw? Will there be any more black partners? Any more black senior partners?

What steps will firms and corporations take to increase the number of black lawyers, the number of black law students? Any more black general counsels? Any more black lawyers in corporate legal departments? Any more black law school graduates? Talk has always been cheap. The legal world should not go back to business as usual. It shouldn’t but will it? All the firms’ statements are variation on the same theme that racism is evil and should be eradicated. What changes do firms and corporate legal departments intend to make? How will we know about them? And what will happen if changes are not made?

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

No lawyers or professionals at our firm are in any way consulting with Mr. Giuliani about his legal fees. The firm and Mr. Giuliani parted ways in May 2018, he is neither a client nor an employee, nor affiliated in any way with the firm.

— a statement from Greenberg Traurig, [denying any association](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/02/02/greenberg-traurig-disputes-rudy-giulianis-claim-about-fee-consultation/) with its former partner, [Rudy Giuliani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani), after he [claimed in a press interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/us/giuliani-concedes-that-an-associate-did-ask-for-20000-a-day-to-help-trump-post-election.html) that one of his associates had consulted with [Larry Levy](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/l/levy-laurence-a), a partner at the firm, about the fees he should charge former President Donald Trump for his post-election litigation.

# The Lawyer Who Freed Britney Spears Has Some Thoughts On His 'Zaddy' Status
## He's incredibly humble, and wants the focus to remain on achieving justice for his client.

Mathew Rosengart (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)

It’s been remarkable but I take it all with a grain of salt. To my mortification, someone sent me the “[RosenZaddy](https://twitter.com/LadyBug47844531?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)” fan account (I had to look up the word “zaddy”) and some of the other tweets as well as the “Rosengod” ones. I sometimes tease the great Eddie Vedder, who is incredibly down to earth and humble, that he is, in fact, a Rock God, which he is. I had the rare opportunity of recently telling Ed that I maybe knew what he felt like for a millisecond, a very slight millisecond, which passed very, very quickly. In all seriousness, it is all very flattering but it really is about the work, the law, and achieving justice for Britney, and that has been and will always remain the focus.

— [Mathew Rosengart](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/r/rosengart-mathew-s), the Greenberg Traurig partner who was able to free Britney Spears from [more than a decade of conservatorship](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/jamie-spears-out-as-britneys-conservator-now-about-that-wiretapping/) under her father’s rule, [commenting](https://www.law.com/litigationdaily/2021/10/08/litigator-of-the-week-the-greenberg-traurig-lawyer-who-freed-britney/) on his [fleeting celebrity](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/britneys-lawyer-developing-bizarre-cult-following/) during the representation. “I knew very little about conservatorship law,” he disclosed in an interview, “but as some of my colleagues and others have observed, that has actually turned out to be an asset.”

# What Biglaw Associates Can Learn From Solo And Small-Firm Lawyers

If you’re a Biglaw associate who’s just read this article’s title, you’re probably trying to figure out what the heck a lowly small law practitioner like me can teach you about succeeding as a law firm associate.

After all, you probably think that most solos churn out form documents for simpleton clients who need help with run-of-the-mill problems like estate planning or divorce or landlord-tenant matters. Whereas you, a law firm associate, grapple with earth-shattering matters of first impression and must satisfy not only sophisticated business clients but also demanding law firm partners. And for goodness sake, you’re billed out at an hourly rate that matches or exceeds what most solos charge. So what secrets of success can you possibly learn from us?

Plenty. But before we get started, you’ll have to dispel your negative impression of solo practitioners. First of all, you may not realize that many solos handle complicated, traditionally “Biglaw matters,” such as tax, corporate transactional work, regulatory matters, and complex litigation. Even solos with consumer-oriented specialties like criminal law, consumer credit, bankruptcy, or family law regularly encounter constitutional issues or dissect tricky federal and state statutes. And while solos may charge less than a Biglaw associate, because of lean staffing and low overhead, they also pocket a larger percentage of that $300/hr billable (as much as 80 percent of it) than you do.

But most importantly, not only do solos deal with substantive issues, they do so while overseeing office administration, managing employees or virtual staff, and constantly marketing their practice. Put another way, solos are the Ginger Rodgers [doing everything you Biglaw Freds do](http://myshingle.com/2009/01/articles/big-lawsmall-law/solos-do-everything-biglaw-does-only-backwards-and-in-high-heels/), only backwards and in high heels. The point is that once you begin to view solos not as loser lawyers who couldn’t cut it in Biglaw practice but as a blend of independent lawyer, team manager, and entrepreneur, you’ll appreciate how solos’ secrets of success can help you too.

1. Own It!

The first secret of solos’ success is that we don’t merely work at our firm; we own it. Every action that we take — or don’t take — directly impacts our own bottom line. So early on, we learn to assume full responsibility for our caseload, our clients, and our destiny. Most likely, you’re well acquainted with the mindshift that ownership brings. For example, you’re more likely to fill the car that you own with premium gas than the rental that you drove on vacation. And if you own a home, you probably invest more resources in its upkeep than you did in the apartment that you rented in law school.

Granted, as an associate, you don’t own your law firm and you probably don’t even own the clients whose matters you handle. Nevertheless, you need to act as if you do to succeed. Ask yourself — if this were your law firm, would you send out a poorly proofed or ill-formatted document to a client because it was only a draft? Of course not — because you’d realize that it would reflect badly on your firm.

Likewise, if you assigned your law clerk to research a memo and he returned with a skeletal list of citations, would you be satisfied? Probably not — so don’t expect this same substandard work product to satisfy your current superiors. If you act as if you own the place, perhaps some day, you will.

2. Get What You Need No Matter What

We solos have no one to rely on but ourselves. We must exercise our professional, independent judgment to determine what we need to effectively and zealously represent our clients — and then stop at nothing to get it. That may mean asking a series of stupid questions to a colleague or perhaps even hiring a more experienced lawyer to help out on a case. It may mean demanding, repeatedly, that a balky client tell the truth about an incident so that we can evaluate her case and establish a suitable strategy. It may mean standing firm before an insulting, nasty judge to make sure that we properly preserve an objection for appeal.

Just like us solos, as an associate, you must figure out what you need for a case and get it at any cost. If you believe that you can’t meaningfully research whether your client’s contract was supported by legally sufficient consideration without reviewing the contract itself, then you must insist on getting a copy. If you know that it will take you at least five full days to summarize the past five years’ worth of employment discrimination decisions issued by the Second Circuit and the partner says he wants it in three, then demand more time and back up your request with a persuasive argument. There’s no sense in sabotaging yourself and producing less than your best work because you didn’t seek out the resources that you determined were necessary to succeed.

3. Build Relationships, Not Contact Lists

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
No doubt, as a solo, my contact list comprises an important part of my marketing efforts. With an email list, I can blast press releases about a recent victory or forward a link to a recent blog post. But while contact lists keep me loosely connected with a large group of existing clients and remote prospects, the bulk of my business comes through referrals from close working relationships that I’ve cultivated over the years.

The same holds true for building relationships in your firm. While it’s nice to know everyone, it’s nicer to form deeper bonds with a handful of partners and associates with whom you share common goals and values. They’re the people who will go to bat for you — and have your back even at times when the firm doesn’t.

4. Different Ways to Skin A Cat

Like Jack who jumped over the candlestick, solos are nimble and quick. The legal and economic landscape changes constantly, sometimes diminishing our fortunes (as is the case for real estate lawyers in recession), but always presenting new opportunities (as is the case for bankruptcy lawyers in recessionary times). The most successful solos monitor these trends, ever poised to find ways to capitalize on potentially lucrative areas.

Likewise, when we realize that one business model is broken, we don’t just throw more resources down the drain, but instead, figure out a way to tweak it to find success. In my own case, after years of waiting for the marine renewables energy industry (one of my practice specialties) to advance, I realized that it wasn’t happening. So I took my knowledge of energy law and renewables and began representing companies developing wind and solar — industries where there’s more action.

As an associate, particularly a young associate, you may find yourself squeezed out of sexy practice niches or interesting opportunities. However, the possibilities remain endless. Instead of fighting with others for a middling position on a project, why not scope out your own business opportunity and start blogging about it? Or better yet, why not ask to interview firm clients for your blogs — which will give you first-hand access? Or you might organize a monthly networking event for young lawyers or women or lawyers of color who are interested in a particular practice area. By taking the lead, you become the go to person instead of remaining the low man on the totem pole.

In short, don’t assume that you need to wait quietly in line for your chance to get the contact or experience that you crave. Instead, like us solos, search for opportunities and figure out shortcuts or alternative approaches to capture them.

5. Learn In the Most Unusual Places

Most solos are sponges, soaking up lessons on client service and marketing from every day circumstances. Every time I thumb through the ads in a magazine or observe how a restaurant waiter deals with an obnoxious patron, I ask myself whether I can apply any of those lessons to my own practice. In fact, some of the most outrageously successful solos borrow their marketing and business ideas not from conventional lawyer-marketing gurus, but from copyrighters, advertisers, and entrepreneurs who’ve found success in other venues.

As an associate, you should do the same. If you represent a successful businessman, pump him for information about his business, his goals, and what keeps him up at night. The information will help you better serve him but will also give you insight into how you might advance your own career. Likewise, if there are a few charismatic partners at your firm whom you admire, observe them closely and see if you can emulate their mannerisms, their dress, and work habits.

Most of all, don’t reject advice out of hand. In most cases, even the worst suggestions generally obscure a worthwhile nugget if you’re willing to dig deep enough. That includes advice from well-meaning friends, from a spouse, or that old, seemingly senile law partner emeritus who constantly reminisces about the good old days when law was a noble profession. And believe it or not, even advice from a lowly solo like me.

[Carolyn Elefant](http://myshingle.com/about/about-carolyn/) has been blogging about solo and small firm practice at [MyShingle.com](http://myshingle.com/)since 2002 and operated her firm, the [Law Offices of Carolyn Elefant PLLC](http://www.lawofficesofcarolynelefant.com/), even longer than that. She’s also authored a bunch of books on topics like [starting a law practice](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0940675625/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0940675625&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20), [social media](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1604429208/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1604429208&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20), and [21st century lawyer representation agreements](http://www.lulu.com/shop/carolyn-elefant/the-art-science-ethics-of-the-21st-century-retainer-agreement/ebook/product-20376406.html) (affiliate links).

# Biglaw Firm That Once 'Strongly Encouraged' Vaccination Will Now Require It To Return To Office
## Will your law firm be requiring vaccinations too?

Much like the coronavirus itself, law firm reopening plans keep changing. Thanks to the Delta variant, many firms are rethinking their office return guidelines — and some are now requiring their employees to be vaccinated.

Lowenstein Sandler — a firm that brought in gross revenue of $350.1 million in 2020 — had previously “strongly encouraged” employees to get vaccinated, but when the firm first detailed its reopening plan [back in April](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/biglaw-firm-announces-phased-transition-back-to-work-thats-sure-to-please-associates/), vaccination was not required for anyone to return to the office. It took just a few months and a pandemic of the unvaccinated for the firm to switch gears.

While Lowenstein reports that “well over 90% of our people have been vaccinated,” management has updated guidelines for people to return to the office if they so desire. Here’s an excerpt from a memo sent earlier this week by Gary Wingens, chairman and managing partner of the firm:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In light of the progress we have made in making people feel comfortable returning to the office on a voluntary basis this summer, and the emergence of the more virulent Delta variant over the past few weeks, we are updating our return to office guidance as follows:

- Effective as of Monday, August 2nd, our offices will only be open to employees who have been fully vaccinated (which means two weeks beyond your last shot).
In addition, the firm is now considering continuing its voluntary in-office policy beyond Labor Day and putting off the next phase of its reopening plan — i.e., employees working in the office “most of the time” (three or more days each week) — that was to begin after Labor Day on September 7.

Will vaccinations become a requirement to return to the office thanks to the Delta variant? Based on policies we’ve seen from law firms recently, full vaccination for a full office return certainly seems to be becoming a trend.

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Lowenstein Sandler.)

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# The New, Best Way To Rank Biglaw Firms

Ever wonder which Biglaw firms are really the best? Not *just* the ones that pull in the most money year after year, but the ones that are, overall, the healthiest? Well, have we got the ranking for you!

Leopard Solutions, in conjunction with Above the Law and Adam Smith, Esq., have come up with a new way to check in on the state of the law firm industry. Introducing the [Leopard Law Firm Index](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/index.php/leopard-law-firm-index-list/). As part of the index, over 4,200 firms are given a score — from 0 to 500 — based on the overall health of the firm.

So, what is this rating based on?

Because, sure, revenue is important — but it isn’t everything, not even close. So this index looks at a a variety of factors to create the Top 250 list including:

- Growth/declines in attorney head count;
- Growth/declines in revenue per lawyer (RPL) over a five-year period, indicating increases or declines in how clients value the lawyers at a firm​;
- Relative success in lateral recruiting and retention (partners and associates)​;
- Insider Score – surveys of attorneys at the firm about their workplace​ (done in partnership with Above the Law);
- Relative success in recruiting and retaining entry-level lawyers​;
- Lawyer promotions;
- Ethnic diversity within the firm.
What’s more, these rating are dynamic — the index is updated twice weekly. Because, let’s be honest, if we can take any lesson from 2020 it’s that things can change QUICKLY. That means no law firms that have shuttered their doors remain on the list like a vestigial tail, they’re culled as things change, so you get real-time information about the state of Biglaw. As Laura Leopard, Founder and CEO of Leopard Solutions, notes:

From Pilot and Above The Law  
“We see firms each year that go under but are still ranked among the top firms in the country by other entities. We also believe that financials do not tell the entire story about firm health. The data points we use in The Leopard Law Firm Index track firm strength and weaknesses in a real-time basis in an effort to give greater insight into the legal landscape. We knew there was a better way to do it and so we did it.”

So, let’s stop talking about the details and get to what everyone REALLY wants to know: who’s at the top of the Leopard Law Firm Index? The Leopard Top 250 ranks the best firms, based on the index rating. Without further ado, here’s the top 10 (as of today — remember, these things can, and will change):

1. Kirkland & Ellis LLP

2. Latham & Watkins LLP

3. Greenberg Traurig LLP

8. Cooley

8. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LL

10. Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP

10. Debevoise & Plimpton LLP

10. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati

It also means different firms made the Leopard Top 250 than the Am Law 200. Here are some examples of who is in the Leopard Top 250 that missed the most recent Am Law 200:

Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian LLP
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer

Quintairos Prieto Wood & Boyer, PA

Atkinson, Andelson, Loya, Ruud & Romo
Maynard Cooper & Gale PC
Cordell & Cordell PC
Clyde & Co.
Clifford Chance
Jones Walker
Warner Norcross & Judd LLP
Godfrey & Khan SC

And if there are winners, that means there are losers. Here’re the Am Law 200 firms that missed out (as of April 2) on the Leopard Top 250:

# Avoid A Reactionary, Band-Aid Approach To AI In Law
## Lawyers’ reluctance to embrace AI, coupled with its ever-evolving and unpredictable nature, can leave many vulnerable to a fear-based, reactionary mindset that is untenable in the long term.

For decades, many lawyers I know embraced technical education programs and CLEs to better understand technology-related legal concerns. Now, however, AI seems to have thrown some for a loop.

“I’ve always felt that AI is too difficult and data-sciency to grasp. It’s all so algorithm-icky!” a lawyer recently told me.

AI can seem complex, but it’s not as intimidating as it appears, I promise.

Another lawyer said, “I don’t have time to learn about AI. Besides, the ethical implications and potential errors that AI might introduce are insurmountable right now.”

We can mitigate the associated risks by embracing AI responsibly and implementing proper oversight procedures.  

Lawyers’ reluctance to embrace AI, coupled with its ever-evolving and unpredictable nature, can leave many vulnerable to a fear-based, reactionary mindset that is untenable in the long term. When AI can vastly improve accuracy and efficiency in legal research, contract analysis, predicting case outcomes, drafting documents, and more, lawyers owe it to themselves and their clients to do better.

It’s True: AI Is Inherently Dynamic And Ever-Evolving

AI’s many impacts are far from certain. Its black-box nature is especially problematic in the legal profession, which values transparency, accountability, predictability, and sound reasoning. 

Nevertheless, [93% of companies](https://lucidworks.com/ebooks/gen-ai-global-benchmark-report/) plan to increase their AI investments in 2024, mainly to improve customer experience, automation and efficiency, and overall business operations, according to a Lucidworks survey of over 6,000 employees involved in AI technology decision-making. 

Numerous survey results confirm that most businesses are on board with AI. Still, lawyers hesitate. According to [a LexisNexis report](https://www.lexisnexis.com/pdf/lexisplus/international-legal-generative-ai-report.pdf?), just 15% of 3,752 lawyers surveyed use generative AI for legal purposes. Because generative AI is new, that number wouldn’t be so bad if an [ACC and Lowenstein Sandler survey](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24002037-lowenstein-sandler-survey) of 165 U.S. in-house legal professionals hadn’t found that: 

- 64% of in-house legal professionals haven’t used artificial intelligence for legal tasks,
- 43% have no confidence or only slight confidence in their understanding of AI, 
- only 25% received any training related to AI, and
- more than half said they don’t have plans for such training.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
(Emphasis all mine!)

The hesitation to embrace AI, coupled with AI’s constantly changing and unpredictable nature, can all too easily lead to a reactionary, short-sighted approach to AI in law. Quick fixes and patchwork solutions cobbled together in haste are incredibly ineffective for AI tools and issues. Uninformed decisions made on the fly typically fail to address the real risks and opportunities AI presents.

It doesn’t have to be this way. A proactive, comprehensive approach to AI can improve all stakeholders’ outcomes.

AI Is A Tool To Supervise, Not Fear

Reluctance can stem from fear of AI replacing lawyers entirely. In reality, AI is a tool that can enhance lawyers’ capabilities rather than replace them. Lawyers don’t need to learn how to engineer AI. Rather, lawyers must supervise its use and collaborate with other professionals to: 

- Understand the broader context and repercussions of incorporating AI into various use cases.
- Evaluate the influence of AI on legal operations, client and employee relations, and society. 
- Weigh the ethical, societal, and financial aspects of adopting AI systems. 
- Strike the optimal balance between technological innovation and adherence to the law. 
In other words, you’re called on to complete activities you’re likely already well attuned to performing.

Skepticism Is An Asset

A degree of skepticism is healthy. A cautious approach helps you critically evaluate the benefits and limitations of AI before adopting it. Your due diligence can help you align AI’s integration with your highest professional and ethical standards and: 

- anticipate potential legal dilemmas, risks, and challenges tied to AI deployment,
- design strategies that preemptively address these issues, preventing legal complications, and
- promote a forward-thinking approach in your organization to pinpoint and resolve legal and ethical AI-related concerns before more significant issues arise.
Are You Ready To Explore The Possibilities That AI Offers? 

It may be easier than you initially think. Let’s dive into this AI journey together and see where it takes us!

How do you think AI could help you do your job better? Are you prepared to make the strategic and tactical decisions necessary to implement AI in your law firm or legal department?

# What Will This Recession Mean For Biglaw?
## Three predictions about how the economic downturn will affect major law firms.

Sorry, folks, but I’m afraid it’s here: the recession. We’ve had a good run, some [128 months of economic expansion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/business/will-economy-re-elect-trump.html) — more than a decade, the longest expansion on record. But all good things must come to an end.

Dating economic cycles is by its nature retrospective, so we won’t know that we’re officially in a recession until the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) [says so](https://www.nber.org/cycles.html). But if I had to bet, I would wager that we are currently in, or about to enter, an economic downturn.

When we look back, this recession will probably be regarded as the “Coronavirus Recession” (or, if you want to be more technical about it, the “Covid-19 Recession”). The worldwide outbreak of coronavirus and the steps taken to combat it are having a serious effect on the global economy, as reflected in the plummeting equity markets (yesterday’s [nice little rally](https://www.fox5dc.com/news/dow-sp-and-nasdaq-score-biggest-point-gains-ever-as-stocks-make-coronavirus-comeback) notwithstanding).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

And as [Neil Irwin](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/upshot/coronavirus-recession-US.html) and others have pointed out, this recession will be especially difficult to address because it involves a “supply shock,” i.e., “a reduction in the economy’s capacity to make things,” as opposed to a “demand shock,” a dip in demand that can be addressed through the conventional tools of monetary and fiscal policy. These tools are already more limited in their power than usual, in light of how low interest rates already are — in the wake of this morning’s [emergency rate cut](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/business/economy/fed-interest-rates-coronavirus.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage), the target range for the federal funds rate is just 1 percent to 1.25 percent — and how large the federal budget deficit already is.

Without further ado, here are my predictions about what the recession will mean for Biglaw. Take these predictions for whatever they’re worth, since I don’t claim any special power of prognostication. (I certainly didn’t see the last recession coming, and yeah, I thought Hillary was going to win too.)

1. There will be layoffs — but not as many as during the Great Recession.

In the last recession, the so-called “Great Recession,” an estimated [10,000 lawyers in Biglaw](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/next-recession-could-cost-10-050057882.html), as well as thousands of staff, lost their jobs. The layoffs were, as Kathryn Rubino succinctly [described them](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/what-the-2009-legal-layoffs-were-really-like/), “brutal.” On one particularly terrible day that we dubbed [“Black Thursday,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/02/so-what-are-we-calling-today-exactly/) almost 1,000 lawyers and staffers lost their jobs.

This recession will also bring layoffs, but I don’t think they’ll be as bad as in the last recession. Why? On the lawyer side, firms haven’t been as profligate with their hiring as they were in the years leading up to the Great Recession (instead preferring to overwork their existing associates before hiring new ones, for better or worse). On the staff side, firms have actually been [making cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/staff-layoffs/) over the past few years, using a combination of layoffs and buyouts to trim the ranks.

Conducting layoffs during an economic boom, sending staffers packing as partner profits hit record highs, struck some as harsh and unnecessary. But it will probably mean fewer layoffs during the recession than we would have had otherwise — you can’t cut more once you’ve reached bone.

2. There will be firm collapses — but not as many as during the Great Recession.

A number of Biglaw firms [fell apart](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/struggling-law-firms-may-face-dissolution-risk-in-recession) around the time of the Great Recession or in its wake, as a result of recession-inflicted injuries. Pour some out for Heller, Thelen, Thacher Proffitt & Wood, Howrey, and, of course, dearly departed Dewey.

But many firms have learned lessons from the recession. Since the Great Recession, firms have been [seeking greater capital contributions](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/capital-contributions/) from their partners, reducing their reliance on bank loans and outside credit, [cutting back on lavish guarantees](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/02/06/is-guaranteed-compensation-a-savvy-lateral-lure-or-an-unnecessary-risk/) to lateral partners, and otherwise shoring up their financials ahead of the coming storm.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Yes, there will be some law firm bankruptcies and dissolutions, but not as many as last time. And some of the firms that will fall would probably have fallen apart anyway, with the recession just acting as an accelerating factor rather than a “but for” cause.

3. Some countercyclical practice areas will pick up — but not as much as one might expect.

The practices that people [talk about](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/02/28/coronavirus-election-jitters-have-law-firm-leaders-pondering-a-downturn/) as somewhat countercyclical, like litigation and bankruptcy, could heat up during the recession. But I don’t think they’ll heat up as much as some might think.

Litigation, I fear, is in something of a secular decline. A recession might slow or temporarily reverse this trend, but I don’t know that it will change the overall trajectory.

Litigation is basically eating itself, getting so expensive that it is fueling the rise of alternative forms of dispute resolution and also leading to earlier settlements, instead of the long-running and lucrative courtroom battles that made the practice a moneymaker for so many years. Also, the discovery/e-discovery process that used to be such a cash cow has been disrupted by technology — and made less lucrative, at least for law firms (with legal technology companies and alternative legal service providers capturing some of the lost profits). There’s a reason why I recently wrote, [“Mammas, don’t let your babies grow up to be litigators.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/mammas-dont-let-your-babies-grow-up-to-be-litigators/)

As for bankruptcy, it is also pricing itself out of existence. Obscenely expensive Chapter 11 litigations have led to more (and faster) out-of-court restructurings and prepackaged bankruptcies. Also, remember that interest rates remain quite low — and will go even lower as the Federal Reserve tries to fight the recession. A low-interest rate environment isn’t good for the bankruptcy bar, since it makes it easier for companies to avoid insolvency by finding new sources of credit or by reaching accommodations with their creditors.

So what’s the bottom line? The bad news is that the recession is here or about to arrive; the good news is that it won’t be that bad (at least compared to the Great Recession; there’s a reason we call it “Great”).

This isn’t very exciting, which might be disappointing to some. But after all the excitement of the past few weeks — the twists and turns of the Democratic primary, the worldwide spread of coronavirus, last month’s stock market meltdown — a bit of boredom might be just what the doctor ordered.

# Good News For The Am Law 100 -- Profits Per Partner Were Up In 2018
## Paydays were pretty sweet at these firms.

One of the most fun statistics that is generated by the annual Am Law 100 is the profits per equity partner (PEP). It’s an opportunity for outsiders to get a look at just how those [big-time revenue numbers](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/am-law-100-reveals-the-biglaw-firms-we-expect-to-make-money-have-made-money/) get turned into million dollar+ paydays.

Things looked good for equity partners in the top 100 law firms last year. The PEP saw an increase across the Am Law 100 of 6.5 percent. Plus, 29 firms had a growth rate over 10 percent, and 16 had a profit margin of 50 percent or higher. Not bad.

But now let’s get to the information we all know you really want. Which firms had the highest PEP? So without further ado, here’s the top 20 firms by profits per equity partner — you’ll note all of them have a PEP number over $3 million, which is pretty impressive. If you want the full Am Law 100 ranking of firms by PEP, [check out Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/23/the-2019-am-law-100-profits-per-equity-partner/).

# Biglaw Raises Are Coming To The West Coast
## Plus extra bonuses for high billers.

The latest bump in Biglaw compensation was initiated by New York-based firms (Milbank and Cravath) but they will indeed be making their way out west.

West Coast mainstay Fenwick and West has responded to the raises sweeping through Biglaw in the best way possible — by matching them. The firm, which made $750,435,000 gross revenue in 2022, making it 66th on the Am Law 100, announced raises yesterday on the following scale:



They also delighted associates with year-end bonuses, according to the following grid:


Bonuses, which will be paid on December 29th, will be awarded to associates that billed 1,950 credited hours. High billers — 2,100+ hours — are also eligible for the firm’s Rest, Recreation, and Relaxation program which ranges in value from $3,000 to $12,000. Additionally, associates that make “extraordinary” contributions to the firm are rewarded with time in a firm condo — locations in Hawaii and St. Thomas.

You can read the full memo on [the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/fenwick-compensation-23/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

He was terrified what would happen if anybody knew he was sick or struggling in any way. If you show vulnerability it’s the kiss of death. You’ll be overlooked for projects or promotions. If people have any doubt that you would perform at the highest level you won’t be trusted.

— Marny Turvill, wife of [Ian Turvill](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/ian-turvill-obituary?pid=187048089), who worked as chief marketing officer at Chicago-based Freeborn & Peters before he died by suicide in 2017, commenting on her late husband’s reluctance to let anyone at the firm know that he was suffering. Professional staff members at Biglaw firms are also under a lot of stress and pressure to perform their jobs well, but it seems as though all of the [recent attention that’s been paid to mental health in the legal profession](https://www.law.com/2019/08/12/in-legal-mental-health-movement-law-firm-staffers-feel-left-behind/) is being afforded only to associates and partners.

# Biglaw Firm Eliminates Performance Reviews, Earns Praise From Female Associates
## Will any additional Biglaw firms adopt this model?

There’s perhaps nothing more frustrating for Biglaw associates than the performance review. Partners’ standards are often vague, there’s usually some generic job skill that could be improved, and no matter how hard associates work, these dispassionate reviews are generally meaningless until they’re not (i.e., they’ll be used to explain away a subpar bonus or an unexpected termination).

Could there be a better way? One Biglaw firm thinks so.

According to [Legal Business](http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/9780-enhancing-our-approach-to-development-a-o-drops-annual-appraisals-in-performance-pilot-scheme), Allen & Overy did away with its annual performance reviews six months ago, and ever since, the firm has been running a pilot program focusing on the use of “feedback and dialogue as tools to strengthen development and performance.” Since October 2016, A&O has used this program to evaluate 500 of its “fee-earners and business staff” in practice groups and staff teams in London, Singapore, and the Middle East.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Thus far, Allen & Overy’s pilot program has received fantastic reviews from everyone — but especially from women at the firm. Elizabeth Mercer, A&O’s corporate public relations manager, elaborated in an interview with Vivia Chen of [The Careerist](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202785675333/Allen--Overy-Drops-Performance-Reviews-and-Everyone-Cheers-Especially-Women?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=7): “The feedback on this has been positive, particularly in engaging with female associates on their career development. We didn’t do it originally to retain female talent, but the positive feedback has been noticeable.”

Of course female associates at the firm are lauding this program. Here are just a few important reasons why that might be the case at Allen & Overy:

Studies have shown that performance reviews are riddled with gender bias, and that [women are often judged much more harshly](http://thecareerist.typepad.com/thecareerist/2011/10/women-associates-get-lower-scores-on-reviews.html) than men. For instance, one study finds that men outscored women in numerical ratings, though women often got glowing comments on the narrative portion of the reviews. (The study analyzed the performance reviews of 234 associates at a Wall Street law firm.)

“The [American Bar Association] Commission on Women in the Profession recognized the problem of implicit biases in evaluations many years ago,” says Roberta Liebenberg, the commission’s former chair. “Double standards are often applied.” Men get praised for aggressive behavior, she says, “while the same behavior by female associates is criticized.” Moreover, she adds, “Mistakes by male associates are more readily forgiven than those made by their female counterparts; and male associates are judged more often on potential, while women associates are judged based solely on their performance.”

Will any additional Biglaw firms adopt A&O’s model? We suppose we’ll have to wait and see, but we’ll note that going forward with a program like this would be a move in a very positive direction for every law firm that’s touted its commitment to hiring, retaining, and empowering female associates.

# Favorite Stories Of 2020: Corruption, Courts, And... Ahem... Jeffrey Toobin

Just a few days left before 2020 is over and one hopes that 2021 will promise better days ahead! On the other hand, I just learned the phrase “[super gonorrhea](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2021/12/27/super-gonorrhea-may-be-spreading-from-antibiotic-overuse-for-covid-19-coronavirus/?sh=66bfb3b175ba)” so maybe not.

Normally at this time of year, we do a post reflecting on the top 10 most read Above the Law stories of the year. But since, “[INSERT FIRM HERE] COVID Layoffs” makes for a top 10 list as redundant as it is depressing, the editors decided to try something different this year. So each of us will throw together a list of our top stories of the year by whatever metric we choose.

For my list, I decided to just pick my personal favorite stories to write about, but after checking the traffic numbers on the year, it looks like my favorite stories were more or less your favorite stories too. So let’s count down the top 10 most read stories of the year from me.

This one may actually turn out to be “wrong,” depending on what happens in the Georgia runoffs, but it aimed to sort out just where things stand on the “court expansion” proposals that generated a lot of attention from liberal and conservative media. Indeed, [the GOP inundated the airwaves in key Senate races with the idea that Democrats might “pack the Court”](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/court-packing-advocates-probably-cost-democrats-the-senate/) and it may well end up being what saves the Senate for the conservatives.

But the article discusses the role the Chief Justice could have played (and might still play) in charting the future of the Supreme Court. John Roberts could shut down the most aggressive court expansion proposals by throwing support behind [the more reasonable staggered term limit proposal](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/congress-introduces-first-supreme-court-term-limits-bill/) and place the Supreme Court on a path that preserves its overall structure while eliminating the fundamentally aristocratic and ultimately macabre life tenure system.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Supreme Court decisions are mostly predictable. [Justice Alito getting deeply offended that anyone would suggest that Jim Crow laws were racist](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/justice-alito-deeply-offended-that-people-might-think-jim-crow-was-racist/) is a quintessentially “dog bites man” story. But Justice Neil “Not Merrick Garland” Gorsuch striking a blow for transgender rights in this summer’s Bostock opinion took a lot of folks by surprise.

But opinions are as important as the result, and where Justice Gorsuch extends basic civil rights with one hand, he reaches to hamstring the modern regulatory state with the other, casting transgender rights as a necessary detour toward gutting environmental laws and the like. The contrast between what a Justice Sotomayor-penned majority opinion would say and this one was stark. It also [got me a shout out on the Majority Report](https://majorityreportradio.com/2020/06/17/6-17-lbgtq-rights-the-supreme-courts-2020-term-w-jay-willis) so that was cool.

8. [Federal Judges Releasing Music Video About COVID Is Officially The Last Thing You Expected From 2020](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/federal-judges-releasing-music-video-about-covid-is-officially-the-last-thing-you-expected-from-2020/)

Just because 2020 was a nightmare, it didn’t mean there weren’t some bright spots. Like this Hamilton-inspired performance from Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and Judge Charles Eskridge of the Southern District of Texas. The pair addressed the court system’s experience dealing with COVID with wit and a terrific performance.

Now I’ve got that song stuck in my head again.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
7. [St. Louis Lawyers Wave AR-15 At Protesters Like Totally Normal, Totally Not Bonkers People](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/st-louis-lawyers-wave-ar-15-at-protesters-like-totally-normal-totally-not-bonkers-people/)

Mark and Patricia McCloskey found their 15 minutes of fame and it was wild. The pair busted out their weapons to wave at passing protestors and became a national sensation. They claimed the march up their street was threatening their home — despite the fact that none of their neighbors seemed to experience any issues — and turned what could have been an embarrassing meme-worthy evening into a grievance parade that [culminated in a GOP convention speech](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/st-louis-gun-waving-lawyers-deliver-funniest-republican-convention-speech-of-the-night/).

This story was always going to make my list though because it [gave rise to a torrent of adorable hate mail](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/opening-up-the-above-the-law-mailbox-of-hate-mail/)!

6. [Donald Trump Didn’t Disband Pandemic Team, He Did Far Worse](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/donald-trump-didnt-disband-pandemic-team-he-did-far-worse/)

When the COVID response careened out of control, liberals embraced the talking point that Donald Trump had disbanded the White House pandemic response team, rendering the ongoing calamity inevitable. Republicans replied that the team was never disbanded… look, it’s right here!

In an article that has very little to do with the legal industry and a lot more to do with basic critical reading skills, I dug into Tim Morrison’s Washington Post editorial defending the White House response, explaining why disbanding the team might have been better for the country than what they really did.

5. [Attention Donald Trump: If You Put Amy Coney Barrett On The Supreme Court, Republicans Will Turn On You Fast](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/attention-donald-trump-if-you-put-amy-coney-barrett-on-the-supreme-court-republicans-will-turn-on-you-fast/)

When Mitch McConnell admitted that Joe Biden won the election and Donald Trump lambasted him over Twitter, it confirmed pretty much everything I’d spelled out in this article. There are Trumpist true-believers still out there ready to pretend that Dominion voting machines run by a Zombie Hugo Chavez are behind everything, but by and large the Republican Party infrastructure is comfortable moving on having gotten everything they could have wanted out of the gold-plated dimwit they’d installed. After packing the judiciary with “[Not-Qualified](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/republicans-angry-aba-rates-judges-not-qualified-not-that-president-nominates-not-qualified-judges/)” judges  — a product of trashing Constitutional norms and keeping vacancies open long enough to create judicial emergencies in the Obama-era — fate gifted Mitch McConnell an opportunity to solidify a far-right Supreme Court and he promptly washed his hands of the president.

Trump’s only smart play was to announce his intention to nominate Amy Coney Barrett but make it entirely contingent on the GOP fighting for him. If they sucked it up and stuck with him, they’d get their real desire. If he failed, he could deny them out of spite.

The only thing I didn’t predict in this article is how much worse off the country would be right now if Trump was able to use the prospect of this Supreme Court nomination to get McConnell to go along with the various coup plots Newsmax and OAN entertain daily. Maybe it’s a good thing that while hundreds of thousands of you read this article, Donald Trump did not.

4. [New York Times Spews A Lot Of Hot Garbage About Jeffrey Toobin](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/new-york-times-spews-a-lot-of-hot-garbage-about-jeffrey-toobin/)

The New York Times ventured into the time-honored tradition of immediately trying to rehabilitate notable media figures for getting caught with their pants down. Or in this case, their dick out… during a work meeting. Their attempt to raise Jeffrey Toobin from Wankgate was so clumsily conceived that it deserves a journalism school case study.

To wit:

But masturbation at a remotely conducted work meeting was a new order of business.

As I respond, “To be clear, masturbating at a work meeting will always be a “new order of business” because most employers don’t provide the opportunity for a repeat performance.”

A thoroughly enjoyable piece to write and one that really resonated with readers. I think I received more complimentary emails from this article than any other all year.

3. [WOW!!! Davis Polk Raises The Bar On Bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/)

This wasn’t a great year for the legal industry, but it wasn’t ultimately a bad one for some of the most elite firms out there. After Cooley opened the door to offering associates a little something extra for their hard work under unprecedented circumstances, Davis Polk went over the top and convinced a lot of the top firms to follow suit.

That said, we shouldn’t let the fact that many firms had a reasonably good year financially overshadow the fact that many others laid off associates and staff. It was a roller coaster of a year for the industry and those of us covering it all have celebrated both the highs and the lows.

2. [Judge Gleeson Comes Right Out And Calls Bill Barr Corrupt](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/judge-gleeson-comes-right-out-and-calls-bill-barr-corrupt/)

Representative line:

It’s hard to believe there was a time when Bill Barr was one of the staunchest of Donald Trump’s loyalists. It’s harder to believe that this time was as recent as a few weeks ago. But way back before the election, Barr was tossing the good name of the Department of Justice in the mud to help out Trump’s other cronies.

Nowhere was this more evident than in the effort to get Michael Flynn out of admitting — twice! — to committing federal crimes. Barr tried to get the case dropped even though it had already ended and was just awaiting sentencing. When former federal judge John Gleeson was brought in to independently assess whether or not Judge Sullivan should grant the unusual request, he compiled a report that pulled very few punches:

In other words, the rule empowers courts to protect the integrity of their own proceedings from prosecutors who undertake corrupt, politically motivated dismissals. That is what has happened here.

Yikes.

But after all that trouble and [Neomi Rao writing one of the most comically ludicrous legal opinions in American history to bail Barr out](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/michael-flynn-opinion-protects-bill-barr-from-having-to-go-ahead-and-lie-under-oath-again/), Michael Flynn has received a presidential pardon anyway. And all it took was his lawyer fanning Trump’s delusions about voter fraud.

Everything’s going great here!

1. [Bill Barr Did WHAT? How Is This Not The Biggest Story In The Country Right Now?](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/bill-barr-did-what-how-is-this-not-the-biggest-story-in-the-country-right-now/)

But before Bill Barr was helping Donald Trump, he was helping his clients. And unfortunately, it appears that he might have been doing the latter even after he moved on to the former. Reuters initially reported that Barr’s client, facing a $2.3B tax inquiry” found their charges mysteriously dropped one week after Barr got nominated for the AG job.

What a coinkydink!

There was a lot to say about Bill Barr’s debasing of the Justice Department this year, but this one more or less slipped under the radar. I thought this deserved to be a bigger story than it was, and thanks to you all, I guess it did.

Thanks for spending your 2020 with us!

Despite the kudzu-like proliferation of law firm ratings, job seekers continue to suffer from a woeful shortage of meaningful, truly informative guidance.

With the new Leopard Law Firm Index, presented by [Leopard Solutions](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/default.aspx) in partnership with Above the Law and [Adam Smith, Esq.](https://adamsmithesq.com/), this changes.

The Leopard Index is also the only such industry report based on purely quantitative, “ungameable” datasets — selected for their correlation with an upward trajectory for a law firm. Most of this data is sourced from Leopard Solutions’ proprietary database, which is continuously updating research on more than 318,000 attorneys in over 4,000 law firms in the U.S. alone.

Each of the index’s metrics provides a measure of a firm’s vitality and resilience — datasets that go to the heart of a firm’s operational and financial hygiene. These include:

- average lawyer tenure at a firm
- internal firm satisfaction
- changes in revenue per lawyer over a five-year period
- relative success in lateral recruiting and retention 
Additionally, our data is:

For law firms, safeguarding client information is not only a matter of good business — it is a rule of professional responsibility.

To explore the cybersecurity challenges in meeting this duty, Above the Law and security operations solutions provider Arctic Wolf surveyed more than 160 individuals responsible for technology decisions in the legal industry.

The findings of this survey show that law firms are indeed aware of the critical importance of cybersecurity preparedness. 

But some firms are also firms lagging behind — thereby encouraging clients to head for the exits. 

To see where your firm stands in relation to industry best practices, download our report below.

# Navigating Economic Uncertainty: 6 Tips To Keep Your Investments On Track
## How you can get through current challenges while advancing long-term goals.

2023 is poised to deliver a tricky environment for investors, characterized by economic uncertainty and heightened volatility amid a complex global backdrop.

Here we share six tips for getting through today’s challenges while progressing toward tomorrow’s goals.

1. Broaden your view of diversification. For many decades, a 60/40 blend of publicly traded stocks and bonds was enough to deliver healthy portfolio diversification; however, things are different in our current environment as correlations tick up between many public asset classes.

Today, the market for privately held alternative investments — in sectors such as real estate, infrastructure, and commodities — is growing in size and importance. By expanding your reach beyond publicly traded securities, you may be able to access uncorrelated investments with attractive risk-return characteristics. At Trion Properties, for example, our [Multifamily Opportunity Fund IV](http://trionproperties.pxf.io/a13Pyj) offers accredited investors private equity exposure to a diversified portfolio of multifamily real estate assets.

When considering alternatives, manager selection is especially critical given the wider dispersion of returns for private managers compared to public managers. Consult with your team of experts to identify managers with strong track records of superior risk-adjusted returns through a full range of economic conditions.

2. Think carefully about concentration risk. Concentration is the opposite of diversification — and it can creep into your portfolio inadvertently. A well-diversified portfolio free from heavily concentrated positions can provide stability in an uncertain environment.

Concentration arises from multiple sources. You might have a large position in a current or former employer’s stock because of an equity compensation plan. Or, you might be feeling the “denominator effect” after many asset classes posted significant losses last year. One portion of your portfolio may have significantly decreased in value, pulling down the total value of your portfolio — and now, another segment of your portfolio represents a larger proportion of the overall portfolio than before. Take a close look at the slices of your current portfolio pie. Are any of the exposures too concentrated for your risk appetite?

3. Appreciate volatility as the new normal. Information is moving faster than ever before — and financial markets are, too. Fueled by algorithmic and high-frequency trading along with growing retail investor participation, the trend toward heightened market volatility is likely here to stay.

While bigger and more frequent price swings can feel stressful, try to see volatility as a potential source of long-term investment opportunities instead of something to be avoided altogether. Investing consistently and focusing on time in market — not timing the market — can help you generate consistently strong results, even when conditions are choppy.

4. Clarify your goals, risk tolerance, and risk capacity. Having the right plan in place is key to being able to confidently ride out market ups and downs in an uncertain economic environment. Make sure your investment portfolio reflects your unique financial situation as well as your goals and time horizons.

Consider both your risk capacity — an objective assessment of the level of risk you can accept to achieve your financial goals — as well as your risk tolerance, which is related to your emotional willingness to take on risk and endure losses.

5. Stay in touch with your team of professional advisors. Financial, tax, and legal experts can help you understand what you own and how it maps to your goals. These professionals can also identify ways for you to keep more of what you earn by deploying tax planning tactics year-round.

During down markets, for example, your team can help you use losses to reduce future tax bills, a strategy known as tax-loss harvesting. Or, if you own real estate, your advisors can help you determine whether a 1031 exchange could help you defer capital gains taxes. They can also guide you on how to maximize charitable giving and manage contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

6. Cash isn’t always king. In times of uncertainty, it can be tempting to pump up your allocation to cash — but hoarding a big pile of cash for long periods of time can backfire as inflation eats away at its real value. Make sure your cash position isn’t undermining your progress toward long-term goals.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# What Is The Ransberger Pivot?

How many times have we, as lawyers, said to someone, usually opposing counsel, occasionally to a client, that he or she is wrong? We never say it to the judge, at least not if we care about our careers, but occasionally we say, “with all due respect, your Honor,” which I consider to be code for “you’re wrong.” Do we ever really win an argument? In litigation, we leave it to the court to resolve the argument, which is costly and inefficient and sometimes, neither side truly “wins.”

Have you ever heard of the Ransberger Pivot? Not me, until I came across the term in one of the various daily news feeds I get. I think it’s an especially interesting term for those of us who spend our careers arguing one side or the other, and in these fractured times, it may be especially useful.

The Ransberger Pivot is a way to start a discussion with people who don’t agree with you without telling them they are wrong. When emotions run high, that can be extremely hard to do. Stifling yourself doesn’t always work. Invented by [Ray Ransberger and Marshall Fritz](https://www.rapidstartleadership.com/ransberger-pivot/), two people whose names I did not know, the pivot is a way to dial down confrontations in disagreements. How many times (and we are all guilty of this), in exasperation, frustration, or whatever, do we just blurt out (yelling, hollering, whatever) that the person who disagrees is just plain wrong? That’s not exactly the way to start out a conversation in the hopes of persuading someone to see your point of view and even have a change of mind.

If the goal of the pivot is to get parties in a disagreement to get to the same side, rather than opposite sides, then that’s what every attorney should try to do. Finding points of agreement helps to narrow the issues and hopefully, convince, persuade, and eventually resolve the dispute.

The pivot approach is simple. The first and most important step is to STFU and just listen. How many of us have problems with that? Simply listen. Don’t interrupt, don’t talk. Questions can be asked, but not in a confrontational manner. This is not a cross-examination. There is plenty of time for that later if agreement isn’t reached.

Secondly, start out with points of agreement. Find out what the other person’s needs and interests are. There is always at least one point of agreement. Sometimes little things lead to the bigger agreements. Trite but true.

The third pivot point is what I call the “whoops” element. If there’s been a mistake, a misunderstanding, a screwup, then admit it. That willingness to admit error, to own it, and to apologize usually goes a long way. Our egos are fragile. Admitting a mistake if there is one (and we all know that the practice is not error-free) can help. We practice law, we don’t perfect it.

Finally, keep at it. The pivot provides the opportunity for rational discussion about differences, how to meet common objectives, rather than escalating the disagreement by using the two words: “You’re wrong.” If any two words can light a fuse, it’s those two. No one wants to be wrong, and yet in litigation, one side will be right, one will be wrong. As many of us have found out to our dismay, how we say what we say matters (and that extends way beyond lawyering). Social media faux pas, for example?

The Ransberger Pivot is about persuasion. How to be a more persuasive lawyer? The article suggests six things to do, and some of them mirror the pivot.

The first is to acknowledge the efforts of those who disagree with you. One of the hardest things that we must do, egocentric as we are, is to acknowledge the other position. It’s the flip side of saying “you’re wrong.” That can often take substantial grinding of teeth, which may make your dentist happy.

Secondly, express understanding. Again, that doesn’t mean that you agree, but that you understand what their positions are. Next is to build rapport. That can be really hard to do when someone is yelling at you, but, as the Brits said during World War II, “keep calm and carry on.” Could that be a motto for us?

The last three things are just as simple but can be just as hard to do: state your position in just one sentence (a variation on the “elevator speech”), be empathetic, and find, if possible, a common enemy. I always called it seeking an “empty chair.”

When dealing with obstreperousness, sometimes I find it less stressful to just refuse to engage. (Chickening out, some might say, but I do like to keep my blood pressure in check. And I am here to tell you that your health must be just as much a priority as everything else. I didn’t do that and as an old lady lawyer, I am now paying the price for such inattention.) Will the Ransberger Pivot or any other of these techniques work to facilitate agreement? Any harm in trying? Anything that can help to facilitate resolution of even the littlest dispute is worth the effort.

Remember that the practice of law is relentless. Take care of your clients, but don’t forget to take care of yourself.

In May 2006, I adopted a 1-year-old shih tzu, Riley, and became a first-time dog owner. Over the past 15-and-1/2 years as my own career has shifted (from lawyer to writer and executive career coach), Riley has been there every step of the way. At over 16 now, he is at the end stages of his life, and while it is incredibly hard to witness (and even more challenging to accept), I’ve learned many career lessons from watching him mature through life.

Find The Work Environment And Career Path That Suits Your Personality

When I initially met Riley, he was sitting by himself among a group of other dogs. You could say he was a loner. He had been badly abused and required someone who could give him a lot of love as well as speak to him in a gentle, calm manner. As I approached him and sat down next to him, he rested his head on my leg. It was kismet. What I didn’t know was how incredible yet challenging the journey would be. I had to acknowledge his needs as well as acclimate him to an environment that worked best for him — this meant socializing him with other dogs, teaching him that he could trust and rely on me, and adapting to his personality.

Understand that you can go in many different directions in your legal career. Personality fit is key for career happiness and fulfillment as it impacts your performance. Think about the type of firm/company (Biglaw, midsize, corporate, etc.) that aligns with your short- and long-term goals. Do you see yourself being a partner in a law firm? Do you prefer to be a corporate counsel and focus more on the business side as opposed to strictly legal advisory? Do you aspire to work for a publicly traded company, startup, or private equity company? Do you want to transition into a nonlegal career?

Write down the type of work environment that would best suit you. Think about the needs you have and what work culture will help you embrace your assets and personality style. Most importantly, don’t let the negative experiences in your earlier career dictate the future opportunities that await you.

Go Where You’re Appreciated And Valued

Sometimes it’s hard to find a place where you’re valued and appreciated (especially in law), but when you do, you feel it in your soul. No matter the challenges you may face along the way, hold on to that peer or boss who truly “gets you” and embraces your best leadership assets and work ethic. Make sure to have those open conversations and increase dialogue between your boss/partner. Consider your six-month and annual performance reviews as good indicators for listing examples where you’ve excelled in your work and discuss long-range projects and plans. Offer ideas that challenge the status quo and see if your boss or partner is receptive to new methods of change. Find out what the firm or company has in store for you in the long term. Listen carefully. Actions speak louder than words. Just as giving a rescue dog his/her forever home is the greatest act of kindness, finding that place where you fit in and feel valued is truly worth waiting for.

Take Naps And Walks

As Riley has taught me, rest and relaxation are important to heal our bodies, give us longevity, and increase our mental health. I force myself to get to bed early because a [rested mind](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/how-my-battle-with-covid-19-taught-me-its-okay-to-take-those-sick-days/) is a better functioning one. A weekend nap is a terrific way to recharge, unplug, and refresh. A daily walk enables us to calm our minds while appreciating our surroundings and smelling the fresh, crisp air. Just as Riley is never afraid to tell me when he needs more care in the form of a treat, a cuddle (hug), a nap, or a walk, I embrace the need for his self-care and my own. His senior years have taught me to slow down, take more walks and naps, and truly enjoy every moment together.

Celebrate Your Wins, Even The Small Ones

In the early stages of Riley’s life, I used to celebrate when he didn’t shred paper on the floor after being alone all day while I was at work. I would reward him with a quick car ride or put extra chicken in his food bowl. In the later stages of his life, I celebrate every walk he takes (he patiently stands in front of his food bowl for a small treat after every potty break), every meal he eats (he’s lost several pounds due to degenerative kidney disease), and each holiday he’s here to enjoy. Write down your goals, celebrate your progress, and boost your own confidence. Remember, the small wins add up to big ones.

Last year’s pandemic-prompted transition to remote working was a stressful move of necessity for most firms. Seemingly overnight, the streets were empty, grocery stores looked like scenes out of a zombie apocalypse movie, and we were all stuck trying to figure out how to do our jobs over Zoom with kids and pets running through the background.

Our industry mostly got it figured out over the following year, shifting our practices online, cutting back on expenses to reflect the newly dispersed employee pool, and embracing new technology. All it took was a global pandemic to force our deeply tradition-bound industry to embrace rapid transformational change.

Yet even today, there remain more than a few managing partners I’ve spoken with who believe everything is going to return back to the way it was pre-pandemic with everyone onsite. What’s more, they’re aggressively pushing for the same.

Respectfully, that’s like aggressively pushing for 35 mm film, pagers, fax machines, cassette tapes, and carrier pigeons to make a resurgence.

 What You Don’t See Might Kill You

Remote working isn’t just here to stay: it’s an increasingly necessary component to running a smart, modern firm. Firms that fail to embrace some level of flexible working on a long-term basis do so at their own peril.

The coming years pose a different kind of danger for law firms, one that’s better hidden and the kind we’re generally less equipped to anticipate and address. The economy is rebounding, and law firms appear to have weathered the worst of the storm. When things seem good and bad times are in the rear-view mirror, it’s deeply tempting in our traditional industry to want to retreat to the way things used to be.

For most firms, that would be falling into a trap of our own making. Returning to the expectation of five days of face time a week is a recipe for attrition, high overhead, client loss, and, perhaps surprisingly, reduced productivity.

Busting The Productivity Myth

Let’s start by busting a big myth out of the gate. When many of us think of remote workers, we imagine people in pajamas watching Netflix and sipping a cup of homemade coffee while the rest of the workforce slaves away in the office doing the actual work of the company. The funny thing is, [study](https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html) after [study](https://hbr.org/2020/08/research-knowledge-workers-are-more-productive-from-home) after [study](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2020/05/20/new-survey-shows-47-increase-in-productivity-3-things-you-must-do-when-working-from-home/?sh=43ce3fe380dc) after [study](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200710-the-remote-work-experiment-that-made-staff-more-productive) keep coming back with results showing that the pajama-wearing work-from-homers are overall more productive than their in-office counterparts. Those results seem to track whether the workers are low-skilled consumer call center workers or highly skilled knowledge workers like attorneys.

It’s not difficult to intuit potential reasons for the productivity boost. Eliminating wasted time is a big one. Workers who don’t have to commute tend to log into work earlier and stay online later. They also spend less time on chit-chat and office gossip, instead focusing more on the work at hand. In fact, we’re beginning to recognize that one of the risks of remote working isn’t failure to produce — it’s burnout from working too hard.

Lower Bills, More Clients, Better Talent

Having workers at home also allows firms to tamp down their expenses significantly. Fewer on-site people means firms require less real estate, which is generally the biggest nonpayroll item on a firm’s budget. Lower expenses translate directly to higher profits, as recognized by industry leaders such as [Perkins Coie](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/09/perkins-coie-anticipating-hybrid-work-to-scale-back-office-footprint/), [Womble Bond Dickinson](https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2021/04/01/womble-to-cut-office-space-by-half-for-post-pandemic-workplace/), and [Husch Blackwell](https://www.huschblackwell.com/inthenews/husch-blackwell-announces-creation-of-virtual-office), all of which have pivoted hard into flexible remote work environments and reduced real estate footprints — with many more following suit by the day.

Beyond just the real estate savings are the day-to-day expenses of physical offices. Toner and paper, meals ordered in for meetings, attorney lounge snacks, and more can all be significantly reduced by shifting employees from the office to their homes. Every dollar saved on an expense sheet is a dollar more of profit, and all those small expenses add up to big checks given enough time.

What’s more, the recruiting and client development teams within firms that fail to adapt will see a growing competitive disadvantage compared to firms that embrace flexibility. When talent is looking for somewhere to lateral to, flexibility is going to trump nonflexibility every time. Clients also want to see their interests are being handled by dynamic, contemporary law firms that understand the current moment. Firms that are stuck in the past, keeping overhead high and presumably passing the expense on to the client, are going to be far less appealing than agile firms with their fingers on the pulse.

The Culture Question

I’m a [longtime](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/why-are-you-a-lawyer-and-why-are-you-here/) [advocate](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/the-culture-card-in-law-firms/) for developing and maintaining a firm’s unique culture. Remote-working skeptics might reasonably wonder how developing culture, which is often so dependent on face-to-face interaction, can continue in a remote-focused law firm. I would counter that failing to embrace remote working arrangements runs more of a risk of damaging a firm’s culture in the long run.

Employees who feel like management is out of touch with mainstream trends have less of a reason to trust in that management to lead them. Even worse, management can come off as callous toward their teams’ desires for more flexibility, creating a divide that’s hard to cross. Many partners still operate on the assumption that if someone’s not working onsite, they’re not working. That position boils down to trust, which is the cornerstone of any strong culture.

Let’s not fool ourselves: there will be a small percentage of people who abuse remote working rules. That said, having spoken with many managing partners at firms across the country about this topic, I can tell you that there are also plenty of people who abuse rules in the physical office. You don’t have to be working from home to surf the web, gab all day with co-workers, or generally get nothing done. Good management isn’t focused on setting a firmwide policy around a small percentage of bad actors; it’s instead setting policy to enable the majority of workers to be their best, most productive selves. Those who aren’t productive or following rules need to be dealt with on an individual basis whether they are in the office or at home.

Flex Days Are A Flex

Not every attorney will want, or be able, to work remotely every day. Some attorneys and legal professionals will genuinely thrive in a professional work environment far more than they will working remotely, especially new workers trying to get their feet under them. Some employees may not have home environments that are conducive to remote work, either due to a lack of dedicated workspace, an overabundance of housemates, lack of reliable home internet, or other reasons. Some workers may want four days at home for every day in the office, while some may want the opposite.

The key aspect of remote work we need to embrace as an industry is flexibility and hybridization. Not everyone can have their ideal situation, but many more can and should have it than do today. Meeting those diverse needs is both good management and good business.

As always, it comes down to the choice between embracing change or watching our competitors race ahead. There will undoubtedly be some firms that double down on the past — dragging all attorneys and employees back into the office full time in an effort to recapture the model of yesterday. The difference today is those employees have options in a market that is increasingly embracing remote working. Smart firms will realize that this trend is here to stay and will do everything they can to improve technology and set policies that keeps the best of the pre-pandemic, in-office world while reaping the benefits from the remote new world.

Donald Trump (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty)

I offer this fact as a historical extreme, the ultimate cautionary tale of what happens when a lawyer enthusiastically goes along with and embraces his client’s worst instincts.

But there is a point well before that—a point where lawyers and law firms of good conscience should say “No more.” When it is no longer acceptable to assist and enable a client who does and says abhorrent things.

I’m looking at you, the silent lawyers who represent Donald Trump.

— Jenna Greene of [Litigation Daily’s Daily Dicta](http://www.litigationdaily.com/daily-dicta-by-jenna-greene?slreturn=20170724150552), calling out the government attorneys and law firms — e.g., Kasowitz Benson Torres; Morgan, Lewis & Bockius; and Jones Day — who [continue to represent President Donald Trump](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/08/17/your-move-trump-lawyers-the-country-is-watching) despite how he has handled, and continues to handle, the events that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia.

# Ever-Growing Dentons Has Expansion Down To A Science
## They're adding lawyers at an astounding rate and the expansion isn't slowing down.

Dentons is averaging one office expanding firm merger or acquisition (“whole-firm combinations” mostly) every three months for the last seven years. That’s… astounding.

About a month ago, I got some flack for referring to the persistent global spread of Dentons as the “[Applebee-ification of the law](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/why-these-global-100-numbers-should-scare-the-bejeezus-out-of-you/).” The thing is, I didn’t mean it as an insult. Rather, I explicitly rejected popular culture’s go-to reference for globalization, “[McDonaldization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonaldization)” in favor of an omnipresent food chain that provides a higher quality of fare. It’s not my fault that Applebee’s was the best restaurant I could think of that has outposts all over the world that offer a consistent level of quality. If Jean Georges offered the same menu at all of his restaurants I’d have used that, but he doesn’t because consistency isn’t the same virtue in fine dining that it is in the provision of legal services. So change it to the Ruby Tuesday-ification of the law if you aren’t an Applebee’s fan, I don’t care.

The point is, Dentons is growing rapidly and appears committed to spreading into every market it can through either merger or combination (two terms that Dentons swears are different). But how does a firm even manage to expand this much? Roy Strom over at American Lawyer got [an inside look at the Dentons expansion process](http://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/03/inside-dentons-merger-machine/). It’s safe to say if you live in a country without a Dentons, you won’t have to wait long.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In previous years, [CEO Elliott] Portnoy and [global chairman Joseph] Andrew reached out directly to every firm they were interested in. While they still handle a lot of those introductions—offering an in-person meeting over lunch or coffee to “compare notes” on the local market—the sourcing of deals today is also supported by Dentons’ eight regional CEOs.

There’s a niche of management texts focused on the importance of letting go. The general thesis is that managers who refuse to step back from their companies become a noxious cocktail of rigid and complacent and crowd out employees closer to the ground with the initiative to forge superior solutions. This isn’t to say that chief executives should relinquish their roles in guiding a company, just that distributing a healthy share of responsibility to others can reap benefits.

It looks like Dentons — with its verein structure — takes those lessons to heart, trusting executives to understand what clients in their regions need.

If a firm is receptive to Dentons’ outreach, Portnoy and Andrew will typically join the regional CEO in the first meetings with leaders from the combination candidate. Then, what the pair calls the firm’s “global chiefs”—its global chief financial officer, global legal counsel and the like—would meet with the firms to conduct due diligence. The same Dentons team has conducted due diligence on law firms ranging from China to Australia to Singapore, Amsterdam, Peru and Uganda, Portnoy and Andrew say.

The due diligence effort relies heavily on information sharing, a process Dentons has streamlined. The firm has a confidential website that includes audited financial information on the firm; info on its lawyers and clients; and other marketing-style materials such as how to talk with partners and potential clients about a tie-up. That information comes in tiers (each with its own password) that Dentons releases to other firms as they share that information in kind with Dentons.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Portnoy and Andrew told Strom there’s discussion of a deal somewhere at almost any given moment. No wonder the process is so streamlined.

Another interesting wrinkle is the fact that Dentons makes all of its partners vote on proposed deals, rather than limiting the vote to one branch of the verein. Portnoy says the move allows all partners to understand the “talent and opportunity” that the firm adds. It’s also a sound internal public relations move — keeping the partners throughout the world steeped in the expansionist message.

And there’s no end in sight for the ever-growing firm. There are 500 cities with populations over 1 million. Andrew told American Lawyer, “until you start talking about having 500 offices, it seems to me you’ve got a long way to go before [a global law firm] could possibly say they’re finished.”

500 offices? Perhaps Dentons won’t object to “Starbucks-ification.”

# Profitability 2.0
## How law firms can improve profitability and teamwork.

A force like Bill Henderson can’t be contained by just one column. In my [most recent piece](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/what-productizing-means-to-your-law-firm/), I discussed Henderson’s views on how top firms will learn to “productize.” This week, we tackle another topic we discussed in my recent interview with him: the evolution of law firm structure itself.

Teamwork Makes The Dream Work

I’ve long discussed the virtues of law firms embracing tools to measure profitability. As the American Lawyer recently pointed out, virtually every top-performing law firm has jettisoned antiquated models of paying partners based on their gross book of business: “A common driver of success in firms that outperform the market is that they increasingly use their compensation systems to reward partners whose books are accretive to profitability.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

But law firm profitability tools aren’t perfect. Henderson points out there are practical challenges associated with trying to manage book-of-business profitability. “[T]hat means you have to manage people individually. You have 300 lawyers, you have to manage 300 people, and you have to use carrots and sticks to get each one to produce.”

And with lawyers across the industry being notoriously argumentative and often having [little understanding of basic business concepts](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/law-school-has-failed-the-profession/), that management challenge can be significant.

Henderson’s solution to the problem is simple: start measuring profitability at a team-based level. “You put attorneys into groups of eight or 10, like little industry clusters, or little client type clusters and say, ‘You guys figure out here, your profit pool is going to be a function of how this unit works together here. So you guys better figure it out here because you’re stuck with that profit pool.’ And actually, it alleviates you from having to manage those people because that group will become self-managing.”

To those that would protest that Prof. Henderson’s idea is a nice academic theory on paper, but impossible in practice, Henderson had this to say: “That was Goldman Sachs in 1960. They moved all their comp to team-based production. The partners said ‘I’m good at generating business, you’re good at servicing internal demand, why don’t we just merge our credits together here? And that totally revolutionized the firm, because it got everybody to focus on growing the pie as opposed to growing their piece.” He added that Goldman Sachs has more in common with law firms than we might initially think: “Goldman Sachs is in the same type of business that we are, professional services. They got people to solve their own problems and get creative, and also alleviated the burden of management. They were managing 30 teams instead of 300 people.”

A Recipe For Experimentation

Does the Goldman Sachs model make sense for law firms? Analyzing performance at a team-based level could certainly ease the burden on management and compensation committees –– freeing them to focus on deeper strategic matters while more tactical decision-making was pushed down to empowered practice group managers. But more than that, this kind of team-level profitability thinking could break a firm free from the billable hour mold in new, exciting, and more profitable ways.

When you tell every attorney in a firm they’re going to be measured on the individual dollars they bring in, you’ve incentivized them to bill hours and make dollars, yes, but you’ve also incentivized them away from efficiency, or from helping others improve their numbers. There’s no “carrot,” or time available, to think about much beyond billing. Everyone has to sink or swim on their own.

If team profitability is the metric, however, then perhaps not every attorney in the pod needs to be constantly billing. Attorneys could be freed up to specialize, play to their strengths, and focus on individual components of a practice group, whether those tasks are billable or not. Teams can diversify, specialize, and reform in new and unexpected ways. A billable-hour practice might suddenly make more sense as a client-pleasing flat fee model. Lawyer-led, long-term projects like [Closing Room](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/what-productizing-means-to-your-law-firm/?rf=1) can be prioritized and developed. Moving to team-based performance analysis could enable the productization efforts that Henderson believes will be necessary to remain relevant as a firm in the coming years. Presumably, of course, all of these efforts will lead to more profit for everyone.

The Problem: That Pesky Market

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
But there’s a problem. Virtually every Am Law 200 firm pays partners on individual performance. If a bold — or naïve — firm tries this model, won’t competitors simply snatch skeptical rainmakers? You can easily imagine a recruiter’s pitch: “A team-based approach is way too risky for a superstar like you. Don’t waste your time –– or jeopardize your livelihood. Keep doing what you’re doing and let us pay you for it.”

Because of market forces, getting buy-in from rainmakers on a team-based profitability approach could be difficult or impossible. The current per-person profitability model is likely working well for them, and this sort of change could be perceived as threatening their share of the pie. Rainmakers will have to be convinced that team-based metrics will allow that pie to grow. Some who don’t like the idea may end up leaving.

If firm leadership could figure out a way to get buy-in, however, a team-based profitability approach could be a great retention tool. As a firm builds up a practice group’s infrastructure to support its experimental new systems, it’s quietly ensuring that the clients who love those new systems stay with the firm itself. It’s also a lot easier for a single rainmaker and a couple of associates to lateral than it is to move a 15-person team relying on firm-developed software and hardware solutions. Savvy firm managers will find ways to make the practice groups cooperate and develop interdependence on one another, both to offer new and better client services and to further enmesh their teams with one another. By investing in team-based thinking, firm managers can increase profitability, reduce the risk of attrition, and help develop that elusive sense of camaraderie and firm culture all in one motion.

Playing Catch Up

It’s telling that we can consider a Woodstock-era management practice as a revolutionary step in the legal industry, but that’s the culture we’ve built for ourselves over the decades. As Goldman Sachs was trying out team-based compensation in the 1960s, virtually every large law firm was adopting lockstep compensation systems. Firms embraced this model to promote a team-based culture, but the unappreciated downside was that automatic raises until you retire doesn’t incentivize a business-minded approach. It does the opposite, and we’re still living with the consequences of that today.

The pendulum has now swung the other way, and smart firms have been heavily, and smartly, focusing on attorney profitability as their driving metric. Although that shift has been an overall improvement, there is certainly room to further develop law firm compensation culture.

Henderson’s approach may be a smart way forward, and I suspect there’s a way for firms to have their cake and eat it too. There are already good metric systems in place at leading firms to measure individual profitability, and nothing says those metrics need to go away. By adding team-based metrics to the equation, firms can get a better picture of both an individual’s accomplishments and their contribution to the overall team. If we can enable experimentation and team-based thinking while keeping the individual accountability our current systems are already good at, could we unlock new, better, and exciting ways of doing business?

The law is populated by strong, smart, passionate people steeped in a tradition of individual brilliance. We’re told stories of great attorneys, great judges, and great professors, but rarely of great teams. The rest of the business world has moved on to a more complicated, productive narrative where group performance outweighs individual heroics.

It’s time we caught up.

# Down With The LSAT?
## Do standardized tests have a place in law school admissions in 2022?

Anyone reading this article focused on the legal industry has likely either taken the LSAT or plans to. For generations of lawyers, the LSAT has been a shared hurdle, a shibboleth, a filtering mechanism, and our profession’s own personal sorting hat. But this universal lawyerly experience may not be universal for much longer.

The ABA is currently [winding up its comment period](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2022/08/22/as-public-comment-period-winds-down-debate-heats-up-over-aba-proposal-to-make-lsat-optional-389-172884/) on proposed revision of its criteria for accreditation of law schools. The most potentially impactful change proposed is the outright elimination of the requirement that ABA-accredited schools include standardized testing as part of their admissions process.

It’s Already Less Universal Than You Might Think

It may surprise some in the readership to learn that it’s already technically possible to get into law school without taking the LSAT. Since at least 2017, a number of law schools within the United States permit applicants to take the GRE in lieu of the LSAT. COVID-19 prompted even more widespread adoption of the optional LSAT — to the point that even the oldest of the old guard law schools (like Yale) have begun allowing law students to apply with only a GRE.

Allowing students to take a GRE in lieu of the LSAT is seen by some as a way to broaden the pathways for talented students to make it into law school. Capable students with financial constraints might not have the funds to take both the general-purpose GRE and the single-purpose LSAT, or the time or resources to adequately study for both. By allowing promising students to apply with strong GRE scores and not forcing them to take the LSAT as well, law schools may find themselves able to consider quality candidates who previously would have had to give up their hopes of joining the legal profession strictly from a logistical standpoint.

The Whys And The Why Nots

If this new ABA accreditation standard goes into effect, however, law schools will no longer even need to require their applicants to take any standardized testing, whether the GRE, the LSAT, or something else. As one might expect, attitudes toward the proposal are diverse and passionate on both sides of the debate. Criticisms and defenses of the LSAT could merit their own column, or frankly their own book. At the risk of painting with a wildly overbroad brush, [the major arguments for and against are outlined briefly below](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/06/15/aba-proposes-eliminating-standardized-tests-law-school).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Proponents of the proposal see the elimination as a natural extension of efforts to free schools to govern their own admissions standards and consider students who might be successful lawyers but don’t thrive under standardized testing and other traditional criteria used to select who gets the opportunity to be an attorney. Arguments also exist that the LSAT, as with most standardized tests, continues to perpetuate unearned privilege. Wealthier students who can afford expensive test prep tend to outperform poorer students who are similarly academically situated. Getting rid of the standardized testing requirement would arguably eliminate some of that privilege perpetuation while also opening up law school admissions to students who would make capable attorneys but struggle with timed, high-pressure standardized tests.

The LSAT’s defenders might rebut or grant these arguments but still argue that the merits of the LSAT outweigh its arguable flaws. Even if it’s an imperfect test, the LSAT does appear to have some predictive value of students’ success in law school and in passing the bar. And the LSAT’s greatest strength is its objectivity and its ability to permit apples-to-apples comparisons among students with otherwise wildly divergent backgrounds, sometimes to the benefit of less financially fortunate students. A student from a small, inexpensive local college might struggle to get noticed in a stack of Tier 1 law school admissions applications, but a 175 LSAT score could help them get the attention they’d otherwise struggle to command. And nothing about the requirements that students take a standardized test like the LSAT prevents schools from still using other holistic, nontraditional criteria for assessing their candidates’ worthiness.

Admitting Admissions Needs Work

The problem with the current debate is that it’s all theoretical. Nobody really knows what the impact will be. The closest evidence we have is what we’ve seen in the [900-plus colleges that have gone “test optional”](https://blog.prepscholar.com/test-optional-colleges-list) by no longer requiring the SAT or ACT. The phenomenon was accelerated during COVID-19 when students didn’t have access to testing. In that context, it’s largely too early to determine the results; the first classes that matriculated from the COVID-19 era test-optional tidal wave have yet to graduate.

Test optional is one thing for college, but it’s still another for law school where students will eventually be tested with a bar exam.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
One way to thread the needle here would be to lift the requirement for a period — say five years — to see what impact the change would have over the long haul. Law schools would not have to participate in this experiment; there’s nothing in the proposal that says law schools can’t still choose to require LSAT scores for admission, just as many do now while others allow the GRE. At the same time, the testing window would give schools an opportunity to see if the mix of students entering law school changes and what happens to bar pass rates. Anything that trends in favor of allowing experimentation and opening up pathways to the law for qualified applicants seems like a net positive for our profession. The only thing we can say confidently is that we will never know unless we try.

Yet as much as part of me wants to have passionate feelings about this hot topic, another part of me can’t shake the feeling that it’s ultimately a tempest in a teapot. The LSAT is … well it’s kind of silly, really. I’ve never had a client reach out to me on a desperate deadline requesting advice on which bubbles to fill in on a Scantron sheet, or demanding to know whether Ted can be assumed to have eaten lunch if the person two seats to the left of Alice did not wear a brown scarf.

I’ve known any number of people who were wizards at testing into law school, geniuses at their end-of-semester exams, and middling-to-disastrous in the actual practice of the law. The LSAT does a pretty solid job of testing a certain strand of analytical rigor, but that ability to quickly and accurately analyze problems is a necessary, but not sufficient, criteria for success in this business. Dropping a 180 on a multiple-choice test says nothing about someone’s ability to land a client, close a deal, build relationships, or sway a jury.

Success in the practice of law takes smarts, but also drive, resilience in the face of adversity, empathy, and an unbeatable work ethic. Those intangible personality traits are much harder to test for, and harder still to identify in the brief time allotted to prospective students in a typical admissions process. But they are far and away the most important predictors of success both during school and out in the professional world. Anyone who can figure out a way to test for that on a Scantron sheet will be doing our profession, and our world, a favor. Until then, let’s push our profession to think outside the bubbles and find the best future colleagues we can.

# Don't Just Shame Firms Based On Profits Per Partner -- Consider Leverage

Behind every great woman is a team of fungible associates…

Let’s take a second to think about this MoneyLaw flurry from the perspective of the partners. While we applaud all the associates (and the associates of the future still in school) making bank over the last couple weeks, consider the partners who — directly or indirectly (depending on how the firm is structured) — voted themselves a pay cut to finance the associates’ dreams.

We’ve focused a bit on the profits per partner of the firms dragging their heels on salary increases, but that figure doesn’t quite capture the decision calculus of the partners. For that, you have to [consider leverage](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-an-addendum-on-leverage/).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
After all, two partners may have the exact same share of the profits, but a partner who has to finance the $20K raises of 1.9 associates is in a much better boat than the partner paying for 4.5 associates. Obviously being highly leveraged has other advantages, but the point remains that using PPP alone to shame partners misses a key factor.

So one would assume that the more leveraged the firm, the less likely — PPP being equal — they would be to rush into a salary raise. This is all, obviously, overly simplistic, but it’s a decent tool to paint a rough sketch.

Using the top 50 of ATL’s Power 100 Law Firm Rankings, here are the remaining firms yet to raise salaries post-Cravath and their associate-to-partner ratio (for some firms, a ratio was unavailable, so I had to approximate based on other data — take an appropriate grain of salt with those figures marked with a “~”):

And this shows us… well, actually not a whole lot. While it certainly goes a long way toward explaining why partners at K&L Gates and Greenberg Traurig are hemming and hawing over this decision — at K&L Gates, where PPP is below $900K, matching Cravath in all offices could cost partners over $100K! — it does relatively little to shed light on what the hell Jones Day’s doing. Especially when you consider the firm hardly has to match in every one of its eighty gillion offices. When you consider that, any given partner is likely on the hook for a fraction of an individual raise.

On the next page, let’s look at the leverage of the full top 50 of the ATL Law Firm Rankings — those that have matched and those that haven’t…

# Davis Polk Is 'Predominantly An In-Office Firm' Now, As It Clings To Mandatory 4-Day Attendance Plan
## Sorry, but the 'modern law firm workplace' is hybrid, without this forced attendance nonsense.

Davis Polk has been doing everything it can to get its attorneys back to the office in the wake of the pandemic. First, in 2022, the firm [mandated attendance on Tuesday through Thursday](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/top-biglaw-firm-returns-to-the-office-with-mandatory-tuesday-thursday-attendance/), reserving the remote flexibility that lawyers had grown accustomed to for Mondays and Fridays. Then, this past spring, Davis Polk revised the in-office attendance segment of its handbook to reflect the fact that [associate bonuses may be impacted](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/davis-polk-associates-bonus-office-attendance/) by their office attendance. Finally, in June, the firm backtracked on its three-day “hybrid” attendance mandate and adopted a [mandatory four-day in-office attendance scheme](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/davis-polk-4-day-office/).

That brings us to today’s news, where Neil Barr, the firm’s chair and managing partner, addressed Davis Polk’s New York lease renewal in an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/15/predominantly-an-in-office-firm-davis-polk-renews-nyc-lease-with-30000-more-square-feet/). It seems the firm is adding an additional 30,000 square feet to its office footprint, for a total of more than 700,000 square feet across 23 floors.

Why is this happening at a time when other Biglaw firms are making an effort to shrink their available office space? Because, as Barr notes, “[W]e believe we are going to be a predominantly in-office firm.”

On top of that, Barr says Davis Polk will continue to grow in headcount, and the firm doesn’t simply doesn’t have enough room. “The footprint is too crowded and needs to be updated to accommodate the modern law firm workplace,” he told Am Law. Here are some additional details:

Barr said he didn’t believe that the amenities of an office should dictate whether or not people need to show up, but he did say that a more worker-friendly office couldn’t hurt when it comes to how people enjoy their time in the office.

“I think there will be a positive impact on people’s experience in the office,” Barr said of the office upgrades that are pending. “I’m not sure their desire to be in the office or not would fully change based on that, but having a modern, interactive and upgraded office will be supportive of an exceptional experience.”

Has Davis Polk considered the fact that the “modern law firm workplace” is now hybrid in nature? Or perhaps that forcing attorneys to essentially be cuffed to their office chairs, no matter how many upgrades to the office have been made, may affect their mental health? Or that tying their hard-earned bonus money to compliance with a mandatory office attendance program could make associates harbor ill will toward the firm?

In fact, have any of the Biglaw firms that are trying to become “predominantly in-office” given any thought to how poorly these plans are likely to mesh with employee well-being?

Considering that the law has been categorized as a [“profession in crisis,”](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/profession-crisis-nj-report-latest-highlight-lawyer-mental-health-problems-2023-04-14/) law firms in general, and Biglaw firms in particular, should be beholden to their attorneys’ and staffers’ mental health and well-being over their real estate holdings. Offering true “flexibility” is what makes the “modern law firm workplace,” not more square footage.

If Davis Polk really wants to offer its attorneys an “exceptional experience,” the firm ought to reassess its thoughts on becoming a “predominantly in-office firm.”

# Increasing Profits By Changing The Conversation
## How do you transform yourself from being an order-taker into being a respected adviser? This question lies at the heart of profitability for many professional services firms.

Situation number one:  A corporation decides that it wants to improve employee engagement (basically, job satisfaction) and thus reduce turnover.  The corporation sends this project to its procurement department, which in turn sends out an RFP.  Whoever submits the lowest price in response to the RFP gets the job.

Situation number two:  A corporation could make $10 billion more in profits if it could only produce more widgets.  You do a study and tell the corporation that it could produce more widgets if the corporation could reduce employee turnover.  You propose to conduct the necessary studies on employee engagement and thus reduce turnover.

First question:  Who earns more when they land the project?

Second question:  How do you do it?  How do you transform yourself from being an order-taker into being a respected adviser to the C-suite — when order-takers and respected advisers are doing exactly the same thing?

This question lies at the heart of profitability for many professional services firms.

The management consultants are great at being treated as trusted advisers.  The big banks are reasonably good at being treated as trusted advisers.  A very few law firms have been able to cast themselves as trusted advisers.  And so on down the food chain, with profitability generally decreasing along the way.

The transformation from order-taker to adviser is in part a question of mindset:  Do not think about what you have to sell; that’s irrelevant.  Think about what the purchaser needs to buy; that’s where the money is.

You’re thinking about this correctly when you’re analyzing what the client needs, and only then seeing whether your firm can provide any of those things.  If you’re looking at things from your law firm’s point of view, then you’ll always be an order-taker, responding to RFPs.

Being an order-taker is easy.

A client calls for your firm to bid on some discrete legal work.  You call out the business development folks, ask them to assemble the usual materials, attend the beauty contest, and win the work.

Great!

But also, easy!  And not profit-maximizing!

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Instead, have someone study the target client relentlessly.  Look at the securities filings.  Review the speeches given by executives.  Scrutinize reports that are publicly available.  Decide how the client could become vastly more profitable.

Then, assemble a few folks who actually know all the stuff that your law firm (or, frankly, other type of professional services firm) does.  See if your services match up with anything the client needs.  If there’s a match, set up a meeting with the most senior people at the client who are willing to talk to you, and explain to the client what the client needs.

Change the conversation.

Because, at the end of the line, you’re talking about exactly the same stuff — the services that you can provide.  But the “same stuff” is now far more profitable.

# If Biglaw Were Woke... Shouldn't It Have A Better Record On Diversity?
## For all the hype, the numbers aren't good.

But in an era where the right has made the term more or less synonymous with racial diversity, law firms again defy the definition, because BigLaw remains overwhelmingly male and blindingly white. Less than a quarter of equity partners at U.S. law firms are women; nine percent of equity partners are people of color. In 2020, the percentage of all partners who are people of color cracked double digits for the first time in history. At the very least, if firms were the engines of liberal hegemony that critics imagine, you might expect them to have hired more than a few non-elderly white guys during the process.

— [Jay Willis of Balls and Strikes, responding](https://ballsandstrikes.org/legal-culture/biglaw-cancel-culture-david-lat-lol/) to [David Lat’s Boston Globe piece](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/01/30/opinion/big-laws-cancel-culture/) about Biglaw “cancel culture.” We discussed that [Biglaw is less “woke” than it is a business](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/biglaw-isnt-a-cancel-culture-its-a-business-that-cares-more-about-money-than-your-feelings/), but Willis also hones in on all the places where the industry fails to live up to whatever “wokeness” means.

# Why Legal Ops Is Critical During Times Of Economic Uncertainty
## Leveraging legal operations can actually help organizations navigate tough times, while maintaining productivity and efficiency.

In times of economy uncertainty or turbulence, the legal field can be significantly impacted. When faced  with this challenge, the first thing many legal firms may be tempted to do is cut costs by reducing legal operations headcount, but this isn’t always the smartest decision. By utilizing the principles of legal operations, organizations can work towards cost savings as a key priority using more strategic methods that can benefit the organization in the short term, as well as avoid putting the business at risk in the long term. Here are four ways leveraging legal operations can actually help organizations navigate tough times, while maintaining productivity and efficiency.

- The importance of establishing a core set of values and mission for the legal department can’t be understated, especially in times of economic volatility. According to a 2023 Axiom Survey Report, GCs agree that having these values in place makes it easier for them to navigate challenges. They recommend that a mission statement be thoughtfully crafted and codified, acting as an enduring “North Star” for the legal department. By adhering to this structure, the entire organization is strengthened. And as the report indicates, in-house surveys have also demonstrated that having a mission statement in place can actually reduce the negative impact of economic stressors on the mental health of legal team members.
- Having the right technology in place can be helpful in ensuring your organization is running as smoothly as possible during difficult times. The explosion of generative AI is ushering in a new era of unprecedented technologies that will be not only more powerful than their predecessors, but also easier to use and implement. In addition, legal operations professionals are positioned to be an important AI prompt engineering resource for legal departments. Those educated on how to effectively use conversational AI can provide help with document review and analysis, basic content generation, and other routine administrative tasks. Utilizing these emerging technologies can allow legal departments to handle a larger volume of work without needing to add additional headcount, which can be difficult to get approval for during economic downswings.
- The field of legal operations was built on streamlining processes and maximizing resources, which is especially valuable when resources are scarce. By automating repetitive tasks and enabling smoother, faster workflows, a company can spend less while speeding up the process of closing deals and in turn generating revenue more quickly.
- Strong vendor management is also key during these uncertain times. By building beneficial relationships with legal service providers, organizations can maximize efficiencies and minimize costs. Negotiating favorable contract terms, consolidating vendors, and using strategic partners can help streamline processes and improve outcomes.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Overall, it is recommended that leaders in the legal field understand that seeking short-term gains by implementing easy cost-cutting measures can undermine more effective long-term strategies that provide the organization with strength and stability. By leveraging and enabling legal operations, legal firms can remain resilient even in tough times.

Theresa Cropper

“Most of my heroes don’t appear on no stamps.” — [Public Enemy](https://genius.com/40475)

This week, I had the opportunity to catch up with [Theresa Cropper](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/theresa-d-cropper.html), the Chief Diversity Officer for Perkins Coie, LLP. She has a plethora of experience in community organizing as well as diversity and inclusion initiatives.

After spending 14 years at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law focused on improving D&I amongst law students, she moved into Biglaw to improve D&I amongst attorneys. In 2015, she was [named](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/perkins-coie-s-chief-diversity-officer-theresa-cropper-named-to.html) to the Hall of Fame of the Black Entertainment and Sports Lawyers Association (BESLA).

Cropper’s energy is contagious and she has a wonderful sense of storytelling. Her history with some of the greats including Dr. Martin Luther King, Reverend Jesse Jackson, and Stevie Wonder is captivating. I was truly inspired by her ability to recite history along with her optimism for our future. Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): You mentioned that you were a baby boomer, a child of the Civil Rights movement, and that your mom was a community organizer. Can you tell us a little bit more about your background?

Theresa Cropper (TC): I was raised to be a soldier in the civil rights movement. In the days of no tech, volunteers were needed at the very grass-roots level — making mimeograph copies, handing out fliers, putting up signs and posters, and helping cook for sit-ins or meetings.

I grew up in strategy meetings, often held in our house; falling asleep, listening to the discussions underneath my room. I was told I could be anything, but the odds were that I would be the first. I was taught to keep the door open after any opportunity afforded me. I watched TV, looking for me anywhere. What I found was people who looked like me being hosed and attacked by dogs. I remember looking for my mother, who had left to march with Dr. Martin Luther King, wondering if she was among those pushed into the streets by the force of the hydrant hose.

I remember listening to my mother tell me about her non-violent training, learning to be spat upon or hit and remain unprovoked. I wondered how that would work for my mom, a woman who did not take abuse easily. I marveled at my mom’s strength to want to learn a practice that was an anathema to her….

I attended Mt. Vernon High School, where we staged a demonstration to have Black History taught in the classroom. We had to research the course to ensure it was taught comprehensively and correctly. In college, I protested the entertainment value of showing The Birth of a Nation. In law school, I was the first woman chair of the National Black Law Students Association. We marched on the Supreme Court on the eve of the Bakke argument, supporting diversity in education.

After law school, I worked for the Reverend Jesse Jackson as his chief of staff, working on several grassroots movements. During that time, I met Stevie Wonder, who was working to get Dr. King’s birthday a national holiday. I was hired to coordinate those efforts and through two marches and a legislative strategy session, the bill to make the holiday was passed. I worked with Stevie as Director of Legal and Business Affairs in Los Angeles before returning to Chicago to start my family.

After the birth of my first child, I joined Northwestern University School of Law as their first Director of Minority Affairs. After six years in that role, increasing student diversity to over 30%, I was appointed Dean of Students.

I remained in that position for eight years before I joined Piper Rudnick as Director of Diversity. As Piper Rudnick merged into DLA Piper, the number of diversity professionals in U.S. law firms had exponentially increased. During that increase, I had had several conversations with many of the firms that were adding this position to their professional staff. Perkins Coie LLP was one of those firms. They asked me to apply, and I am entering my 11th year with them.

RC: You were the first in your family to graduate college as well as law school. What advice do you have for first-generation law school students?

TC: Remember what my grandmother told me, “Know where you take yourself and then act like you belong.”

If you had the courage, the audacity, and the confidence to apply to law school, and get in, then find your place and your voice with the clear understanding that it was not a mistake to have admitted you. You belong there. You were accepted because you can add value to the classroom, your colleagues, professors, and the profession. Remember the shoulders you stand upon — people who dreamed of you and knew they would not live to see you in a law school classroom. Honor them with your intellectual curiosity, pay homage with your active citizenship, and prove them right by your excellence in everything you do.

Decide on your contribution to the law school. How do you want to make your mark? How will you be remembered? If you needed top secret security clearance, what would investigators learn about your tenure at the law school? What is your reputation and what do you want it to be? Are you an active, influential, persuasive citizen? Do you have academic curiosity? Are you a leader in the student organizations? Do you bring good ideas to the administration? Does anyone know your name? Will anyone remember you, and what will they remember? Make your mark because you were admitted to do so.

RC: You were the first Director of Minority Affairs and then the Dean of Students at Northwestern University School of Law during your 14-year tenure. What do you think law schools can do better to promote diversity and inclusion?

TC: Make sure you have someone who is dedicated to diversity full time. A diversity professional can guide the community through programs and initiatives that create, encourage, and embellish community. Law schools need to explore how they can develop a sense of community within the incoming class, first-year sections, and the law school community. Try diversity training by sections in the first year. It is subliminal team building. Diversity training will allow students to get to know each other beyond the optics that often distract them from genuinely appreciating each other’s value. This could change the compositions of study groups and gatherings.

Facilitating opportunities to have comfortable curiosities should always have a place in the academy. Remember that change in a student culture can happen in a three-year cycle. Set the tone with the first-years; have the rising 2Ls establish the expectations with the new first-years, and these students as third-years will lead the community evolution from the initiative in their first year.

RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

TC: As far as we have come with diversity, there is so much more work to be done. Anyone and everyone can contribute to creating a more inclusive community wherever you are.

Look around: Who is not being asked to lunch, events, etc.? Who has the inside knowledge and power and who doesn’t? Who does not speak up in meetings? When was the last time you reached out to someone new or different? When did you suggest someone who never gets picked for projects? When did you try to give the inside scoop on a new employee?

Diversity is about differences, and it is not always about race, gender, sexual orientation or ability that you think you see. The invisible differences are just that: invisible.

Assume that everyone has differences; we do. That is the beauty of life and our world. Do not get distracted by the visuals and do not make assumptions about what you don’t see. Remember empathy, and it will go a long way.

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Theresa Cropper for taking the time to share her story with our audience. We wish her continued success in her career.

# Hogan Lovells Reelects CEO, Who Says The Elite Firm Will Only Merge With 'Winners'
## He seems to be giving some major side-eye to Shearman.

Just because an elite Biglaw firm has backed out of a merger, it doesn’t mean that growth isn’t on the firm’s mind.

Hogan Lovells recently reelected Miguel Zaldivar as its CEO, and he says the firm may still have the urge to merge — but only under certain circumstances. You may recall that the firm — which brought in $2,432,000,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 12 in the Am Law 100 — [pulled out](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/rumored-merger-between-hogan-lovells-and-shearman-scrapped/) of a rumored merger with Shearman & Sterling back in March, and that seems to have colored Zaldivar’s thoughts on any future merger plans. Here’s more from the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/05/re-elected-hogan-lovells-ceo-says-merger-still-a-possibility-highlights-other-paths-to-growth-405-128145/), which interviewed Zaldivar on the eve of his reelection:

“Do we need a merger? No,” Zaldivar said…. “I’m a business lawyer, though, and if we find opportunities that enhance our offering in those markets … and are aligned with our vision and strategy, it would be irresponsible to not consider it.”

Zaldivar went on to say that if a firm shares Hogan Lovells’ vision of providing legal services in highly regulated sectors and doesn’t come with significant financial baggage, “we’re open to talking.”

“I’m not going to do it with a firm that would compromise our financial position,” Zaldivar said. “I don’t want to talk to firms that have huge pension commitments or revenue drops because of partner departures or that are suffering in branding recognition. We would like to be opportunistic and associate ourselves with winners.”

Hogan Lovells has very high standards when it comes to prospective merger partners, and losers need not apply. (Absolutely no shade to Shearman, of course.) Under Zaldivar’s leadership, the firm has reached the highest of financial heights, and he wants to make sure Hogan Lovells keeps winning without being dragged down by a firm that’s struggling.

“We are having an outstanding year,” he told Am Law, when speaking about the firm’s 2023 financial forecast. “It’s a year when every single practice group and every single region is seeing growth in demand, revenue and realized rate.”

So, where is Hogan Lovells looking to see growth? Am Law has the details:

[F]irm leaders would like to expand the firm’s business in some of the most competitive U.S. markets for legal services that align with the firm’s focus on sectors with high regulation: namely financial services, mobility and transportation, life sciences and health care, technology and energy.

“We’re very serious about growing in New York, California and Texas,” he said.

# Leaving Biglaw vs. Changing Your Biglaw
## It’s no secret that Biglaw associates are working harder than ever. But before you think of leaving Biglaw altogether, consider whether a change of Biglaw environment makes sense first.

The number of law firm associates that are leaving Biglaw altogether right now is quite high.  Associates find opportunities in or out of legal practice which they think will provide better hours with acceptable pay.  The misconception is that if they go to another Biglaw firm that everything will be the same.  However, there are meaningful differences among associate Biglaw experiences.  If you are at a Biglaw firm yourself, just think about your own firm: If you talk to other associates in different practices areas or different working groups, chances are you will hear about some completely different work cultures.  The fact is that there are meaningful differences in Biglaw experiences.  You just need to do the research and work with a recruiter that will help you find out “if the grass is greener.”

3,000 hours vs. 2,500 hours vs. 2,000 hours or less

Biglaw firms can be opaque when it comes to actual hours billed by their associates.  Maybe a firm has a 1,850 hour requirement, but everyone knows the firm expects much more to get a bonus.  Maybe the firm does not have a billable hour requirement, but associates in a particularly busy practice are all working at 2,800 hours a year.  The fact is that some associates have higher billing hour expectations than others.  For example, lots of transactional associates with whom I speak are on track for that 3,000 mark this year (same as last year and the year before).  Some attorneys and firms will say that working like this is just part of the Biglaw world, while others are conscious of staffing their groups appropriately to keep their associates at a more sustainable level.  The number of billable hours per associate can ultimately differ at the firm level, the practice level or even the working group level.

No false deadlines and clearer direction

One of the biggest complaints that I hear from Biglaw associates that are looking to leave has to do with work supervision.  They work with partners or senior associates who give them unclear direction or false deadlines (e.g., a partner who says “get this memo to me by the end of the weekend for the client” but then they sit on the work product for days or weeks).  This approach is not universal in Biglaw.  Clients are demanding and turnaround times can be quick.  But a thoughtful supervising lawyer will make it clear when deadlines are truly urgent.

Different clients

Maybe the problem with your Biglaw experience is the type of clients you advise.  The problem could be very specific, meaning you have individual clients with difficult personalities.  Or it can be industry type.  For example, I sometimes speak with corporate associates who advise on deals in industries to which they do not feel connected.  A common reason that associates lateral to another Biglaw firm is to change the client base which they advise.  Maybe you want to represent primarily companies in technology, life sciences or some other major industry.  Making a change for this reason can help you feel more fulfilled in your work and also create a more desirable platform for an in-house move later on.

Getting more runway before you leave Biglaw

Lots of Biglaw associates leave for non-Biglaw opportunities that sound really good, but end up being limiting or undesirable in some way.  If you leave for a government or in-house job at a very junior level, for example, it can be difficult to get promoted and move up.  When more senior opportunities open up at these employers, they may look to more senior attorneys in Biglaw.  Additionally, I have spoken to in-house attorneys that work just as hard, if not more, than a BigLaw associate. Finally, more time in Biglaw can give you a better understanding of what you want and what you don’t want long-term out of a legal career.  Too many associates just leave for the first opportunity they get out of Biglaw not because they know what they want, but because they just want to leave as soon as possible.

Ultimately, whether to leave Biglaw altogether or change your Biglaw situation is a difficult and specific situation.  No matter what you do, talk to trusted advisors and friends before you make any quick decisions.

# More Law Firms Should Offer Work Cellphones To Employees
## Perhaps it would help them be able to better separate their work-life boundaries.

There was a time when it was common for attorneys and staff at many law firms to be issued cellphones owned by the law firms for which they worked. In earlier years, it was less common and more expensive to own smartphones, and many law firms issued these devices to employees so they could be more productive. In recent years, most law firms do not issue employees cellphones for work, probably because of the expense and because almost everyone has a smartphone these days. In addition, many people may not wish to have two phones to carry around at any given time. However, more law firms should offer employees work cellphones so that attorneys and staff can better separate work-life boundaries.

When I was a summer associate a decade ago, it was common for many Biglaw firms and other shops to provide associates and some staff with smartphones. Indeed, I was issued a BlackBerry as a summer associate, and this was the only time I ever possessed this legendary device. When I returned to the firm a year later as a full-time associate, I was issued an iPhone — the firm had made the transition to iPhones by then.

Having a work phone proved useful in a number of circumstances. I was able to reduce the amount of data I used on my personal phone. Moreover, I did not need to give my personal phone number to work colleagues, clients, and others since I was able to provide the information for my work phone. In addition, it was easier to separate my work from my personal life since all of my work contacts, emails, and other work-related content was on my work phone while my personal phone was used almost exclusively for personal use.

I also did not mind that I had to carry around two phones so that I could have access to work material and also have my personal phone. Indeed, I felt kind of like a baller with two phones, although a lot of people made jokes that only drug dealers had two phones (probably a reference to “Breaking Bad” as I think about it in hindsight). It was not too inconvenient for me to carry around this work phone, and in a weird way, it was kind of a status symbol which showed I worked for an employer that had the resources to provide me with a phone.

As I moved through my career, it became less and less likely that law firms would provide work phones to employees. In order to compensate for this, law firms usually pressure employees to use their own phones for work-related business. In many instances, law firms require employees to install software onto their phones that permit law firms to delete work materials if the employee is terminated or otherwise leaves a firm.

This is extremely problematic because it is unclear if law firms are able to track employees through the applications they need to install on their phones in order to access work content on their personal devices. In addition, I have anecdotally heard of issues when law firms delete work data after a separation, and some of my friends have lost all of their contacts in their phones seemingly because of applications their firms had them install on their devices. Moreover, employees may have higher out-of-pocket expenses if they need to use their personal devices for work matters, and not all law firms provide funds to employees to offset the cost of using personal devices for work matters.

In addition, requiring employees to use their personal devices for work matters may further blur the lines between personal life and work. The work-life balance has been under attack in recently years, and this separation is far easier to control if employees are issued work phones. For instance, employees can choose whether they wish to bring their work phones to vacations, holiday outings, and other events in their personal lives. It is much more difficult for people to leave their personal phones at home when they want to be disconnected from work because people rely on their personal phones for all kinds of uses. In addition, the physical separation of using one device for work and another device for personal uses can help individuals maintain a wall between their personal life and work.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Of course, many people may not want to have a work phone since individuals may not want to lug around multiple devices, and they may feel most comfortable with a personal phone that they selected. However, more law firms should give employees the option of having a work phone if they want to keep their work separate from their personal lives. It is unfair for law firms to force employees to use their personal devices for work matters if they do not wish to do so and giving employees the option of having a work phone empowers employees to make informed decisions about how they approach work.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Everyone's Apparently Not A Winner At Nixon Peabody

It’s time we clear up this whole Nixon Peabody mess: at this time, we’re pretty sure they’ve not issued raises.

Last week, we received multiple tips in quick succession that Nixon Peabody had matched Cravath’s raises. None of these tips included a memo. That said, we felt the news was pretty reliable given both the sheer number of tips we got in rapid succession and the explanation one tipster provided for the missing memo:

Nixon matched Cravath finally!! The associates heard in a meeting. Memo apparently to follow sometime soon with details.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This wouldn’t have been the first firm to hand out raises via meeting without a tangible memo.

But since those tips, everything got very, very weird.

One Nixon Peabody tipster noted that night that he hadn’t heard the same news, which wasn’t entirely disqualifying since in-person announcements don’t necessarily reach everyone. We didn’t think much of it at the time… but this becomes the last news we get from inside the firm.

Then multiple tipsters from other firms started telling us that “they heard” from “people who heard” that the story wasn’t true. Usually such second-hand intel wouldn’t mean much, but it started streaming in and all our Nixon Peabody sources were clamped down like they were planning a North Korean surprise party.

Then we got this detailed explanation — again from someone who isn’t at Nixon Peabody:

Andrew Glincher sent out an email saying that NP had not raised rates and that the ATL story was in error. He has had it in for ATL ever since the theme song/not a theme song days….

Oh yeah… [the song](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/08/nixon-peabody-this-is-not-a-love-theme-song/). Look, if he’s “had it in for ATL,” he probably should direct his efforts elsewhere. Because we don’t make the news, we only pass it along. If a firm wants to write the dumbest theme song ever, that’s not our fault. And if a firm wants to be known for lingering behind the times on associate compensation, that’s not our fault either.

We’ve reached out to the firm directly and this is what they had to say:

Thanks for reaching out for comment. There have been no such changes to our associate compensation program from what was announced in March 2015.

So, law students and potential laterals, take note that Nixon Peabody has not issued raises to match the industry standard. We’ll see what they do going forward.

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

This week, the New York City (City) Bar published its latest [Diversity Benchmarking Report](http://documents.nycbar.org/files/NYC_Bar_2015_Diversity_Benchmarking_Report.pdf). There were several notable bright spots in the report; however, women and minorities still face around a 50% higher voluntary attrition rate than white men.

According to the report, this attrition rate continues to disproportionately impact minority and women attorneys, with 18.4% of women and 20.8% of minorities leaving signatory firms in 2015 — a slight decrease from 2014, but still well above the 12.9% rate for white men. This equates to a 42% and 61% higher voluntary attrition rate for women and minorities, respectively.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
For the first time, the City Bar’s 2015 benchmarking survey provided detailed data on the racial/ethnic makeup of attorneys who left each signatory firm. Of all reported attorneys, 12% of attorneys who left firms were Asian/Pacific Islander, 4% Black/African American, and 5% Hispanic. In a [previous column](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/what-could-disrupt-diversity-in-law-the-economy-stupid/), I noted that Asian students also had the [largest drop](http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/cypress/nationaljurist1114/#/24) in law school enrollment – 16%. If you are attending this year’s [National Asian Pacific American Bar Association Convention](http://www.napaba.org/?page=2016_Convention) in San Diego, I’d love to connect with you and talk about these statistics.

The 2015 Diversity Benchmarking Report is unique, and more robust than previous reports, for two reasons:

First, participation in the survey was mandatory in order to be listed as a signatory to the City Bar Statement of Diversity Principles. As a result, signatory law firm participation in the survey nearly doubled, thus providing robust data not available in 2014 and a more accurate reflection of our signatory firms. We applaud the 75 law firms that have committed the time and energy to participate.

Additionally, for the first time since we began administering the survey in 2004, we requested a breakdown of individual racial/ethnic groups for men and women, rather than data on ‘minority attorneys’ as an aggregate. This important change allows us to report specific details in each category where representative data was collected. We believe this specificity will allow the firms to explore challenges in a more nuanced way and create solutions tailored to a diverse population of lawyers.

Admittedly, while the numbers are not optimal, there are still several positive trends:

- LGBT attorney representation has more than doubled since the City Bar began collecting self-reported data in 2004, and representation of LGBT partners has increased from 1.4% to 2.4%;
- women showed notable gains in representation on firm management committees and among practice group heads, and women partners peaked at 19% (however, white women make up 85% of all women partners, and minority women make up less than 3% of all partners in signatory firms);
- although representation of minority attorneys overall remains relatively flat, representation at the Special Counsel level increased, as well as minority representation in leadership bodies; and
- the percentage of minority management committee members and minority practice group heads increased, and the percentage of law firms with three or more minority attorneys on the management committee doubled from 7% in 2014 to 14% in 2015.
The report also highlighted renewed efforts by law firms to retain and promote minority attorneys, including:

- engaging practice group leaders in monitoring work allocation protocols and quality of assignments;
- intentional pairing of partners and associates, where a partner is responsible for the associate’s development;
- training partners to understand and interrupt implicit bias and develop objective evaluation and feedback methods;
- assessing client team composition and product on the firm’s most significant matters; and
- providing associates with executive coaches.
According to the report, one in four signatory firms has no women on its management committee, and one in eight firms has no women practice group leaders. Three in five signatory firms have no racial/ethnic minorities on its management committee, and one in three firms has no minority practice group leaders.

Hopefully, these ratios will improve over the coming years. If these top-level structures do not evolve, it’s hard to imagine overall numbers in these firms dramatically improving.

Kudos to the City Bar and its signatory firms for providing the legal profession with such illuminating research. The 2015 [Diversity Benchmarking Report](http://documents.nycbar.org/files/NYC_Bar_2015_Diversity_Benchmarking_Report.pdf) is a must-read for anyone seeking to improve diversity in their firms, especially if you are a diversity chair, member of a diversity council/committee, or designated diversity professional.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# 97% Of General Counsels Agree: #Winning Isn’t Everything
## The last thing an enterprise wants is to wind up in the news for using business partners who themselves are making headlines due to unaligned ethical choice.

I’ve [written previously](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/the-geopolitics-of-selecting-lawyers/) about the rising importance of ethics in the selection of external counsel. Now I’ve got fresh proprietary data to back it up.

I’m continuously hearing that law departments want greater alignment with their external law firms. It’s no longer good enough for Biglaw partners to do good work and serve as golf buddies. Corporations are looking for a deeper connection and are threatening to hold law firms to account.

Yet, when I talk to in-house teams about this, there are varying levels of commitment. Yes, alignment is important, some say. But you know what’s more important? #winning.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This is starting to shift.

Last month, for instance, [Kirkland and Ellis](https://www.kirkland.com/) — the highest-grossing law firm in the world — announced that it was no longer going to be doing work in relation to the U.S. Second Amendment. This came in conjunction with the departure of two major partners who had worked with the National Rifle Association, on the back of their Supreme Court victory in favor of a gun group. Perhaps this was a broader reputational choice, but [sources told the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/winning-lawyers-in-supreme-court-gun-case-leave-firm-11656026132) that K&E “started getting a lot of pressure post-Uvalde, hearing from several big-dollar clients that they were uncomfortable.”

Those two partners explained their point of view in a Wall Street Journal opinion titled “[The Law Firm that Got Tired of Winning](https://www.wsj.com/articles/2nd-amendment-bruen-new-york-gun-case-supreme-court-decision-kirkland-and-ellis-rule-of-law-constitution-11656017031).” So, it seems, in today’s politically red-hot environment, winning is no longer everything. Corporations not only have these preferences, they are asserting them, and law firms are responding.

We at [Hence](http://www.hence.ai) commissioned [Coleman Parkes Research ](https://colemanparkes.com/)to interview 150 general counsels, chief legal officers, and heads of legal operations across the United States and the United Kingdom on a host of issues that impact their usage of external lawyers, which we will make public in coming weeks. And probably moreso than any other question we put to them, they overwhelmingly agreed on this one ethics point.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Ninety-seven percent of corporate counsel leaders told us they would take action if they discovered a law firm they were working with did not meet their ethical or values criteria. This is surprisingly high — can you think of another issue that 145 GCs and CLOs would agree on?

More specifically, just under half (47%) said they would stop using the firm and move to another firm, 29% opted for asking the law firm to make improvements, without a specific timeline, and 21% would ask for similar improvements with a specific timeline. Only 3% said they would do nothing.

(Click to enlarge)

When we pressed further on what types of circumstances would impact usage of a given law firm, the data was even more interesting. Over 90% agreed that law firm involvement in a scandal, a law firm being subject to investigation, a law firm representing politically or publicly unfavorable clients, or a law firm supporting political or social goals that a corporate does not agree with or support would have some impact on their usage of the firm. As you can see in the table below, all of these factors would have a strong impact for at least half of counsel surveyed.

This was not uniform across the U.S. and the U.K. The number of individuals who said that particular factors would have a strong impact was much higher in the U.S. than the U.K. on every factor.

OK, so we’ve learned that legal department leaders are poised to take action when their law firms diverge from their values criteria. We’ve noted that those actions vary and that the particular factors we surveyed drew a stronger reaction in the U.S. than in the U.K.

The question that remains is now whether corporate law departments are actually aware of these violations of their ethics.[ As I’ve written about previously](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/the-geopolitics-of-selecting-lawyers/), many departments are able to ignore transgressions because they don’t have a system to keep track of how their counsel are behaving — they can authentically say they were unaware of something like the gun lobby example above for years and years until it becomes so problematic that they are made aware of it. With lawyers, this matters — lawyers literally “represent” their corporate clients, and their actions can set precedents that run counter to the values some of their corporate clients hold dear.

We use technology to monitor everything — from how many breaths we take when we sleep to whether every part of an airplane is operating optimally while in flight. We share data and monitor quality and ethics of our hard goods supply chains. Keeping track of our knowledge partners — like lawyers — is in no way more complex.

And stepping back a little a from the clickbait-y title, the reality is that law departments do care about winning. It’s just that the definition of winning and losing is changing. As companies are increasingly held to account for the actions of their partners, when a company chooses the wrong vendor — even for services — that can harm their own reputation in today’s hyper-connected world. The last thing an enterprise wants is to wind up in the news for using business partners who themselves are making headlines due to unaligned ethical choice.

At [Hence](http://www.hence.ai), we’re always keen to hear from corporates who are tackling this challenge. Please be in touch if you’re one of the 97% and have winning approach or otherwise want to take action.

I did that [violating legal ethics rules] on my own, nobody held a gun to my head.

I wouldn’t wish an indictment and a conviction on my worst enemy, and if I could wave a magic wand and make it all go away, even if it meant removing all the personal growth I had, I would wave that magic wand.

— Robert M. Schulman, who once worked as an intellectual property litigation partner at Hunton & Williams and Arent Fox, in [testimony](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/ex-hunton-partner-presses-bar-readmission-after-securities-conviction-2022-01-14/) given before the Board on Professional Responsibility of the D.C. Bar late last week. Schulman was [convicted of conspiracy and securities fraud](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/biglaw-partner-convicted-of-insider-trading-after-jury-trial/?rf=1) in 2017, and later agreed to a [three-year suspension](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/former-biglaw-partner-suspended-from-practice-of-law-after-insider-trading-conviction/) of his license to practice law, retroactive to June 28, 2018. In 2010, Schulman allegedly [got drunk before sharing insider information](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/09/tipsy-partner-tipped-insider-trading-defendant-sec-alleges/), and continues to deny criminal liability.

# Biglaw Firm Holds Firm Meeting To Say They're Making Tons Of Money And Won't Be Giving It To Associates
## Maybe this isn't a meeting that needed to be called.

Kirkland & Ellis is raking in the dollars these days and isn’t ashamed to let everyone know about it. Kirkland’s so far and away ahead of the competition that a recent study suggested that it’s worth almost double its nearest competitor, [even dunking on Toys R Us](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/kirkland-ellis-successfully-profits-off-our-crumbling-childhood-memories/). No one is missing the newsflash that it’s now Kirkland’s world and we all live in it.

At least until the private equity space collapses.

But we’ve received reports that the firm must have worried that U.S. associates were missing out on the news because the firm convened its routine firm meeting and offered an hour-long town hall to tell everyone about how rapidly the firm is growing, how efficiently the firm has cut costs, and how much more the partners are taking home in profits. Equity partners, anyway.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It’s the sort of presentation that one wouldn’t expect an associate would need to forfeit a billable hour to attend… unless it was setting up some exciting news. Perhaps this was the prelude to: “And therefore without even dimming our dreams of a new summer home in the South of France, we’re giving you all $5K to spend this summer!”

Alas, the presentation just sort of ended after telling all the young lawyers about the partner largesse. During the Q&A period, someone allegedly asked about summer bonuses and the firm responded that those certainly weren’t planned unless the market moved, prompting [Gunderson Dettmer to wonder when they became chopped liver over here](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/gunderson-announces-summer-bonuses-your-move-am-law-100/).

Apparently associates overlooked the small part they had inadvertently played in “how efficiently the firm has cut costs.”

While Kirkland is, in many ways, the model of “Biglaw firm as corporate business,” taking as many cues from the Fortune 100 as it does the Am Law 100, an all-hands meeting to gloat about share price is one they probably should have left on the cutting room floor. When a megacorporation invites everyone to see how profitable the company is, the reason that doesn’t end in guillotines is that even the lowliest staff members have some stock options in their pockets and see the slightest profitability jump as impacting them directly — if ever so slightly. But when the partners in a law firm boost PPP by another $200K, the associates don’t get anything out of the deal.

# Salary Cuts Are A Thing Of The Past At This Biglaw Firm
## Full salaries in the fall for associates!

Biglaw salaries are very much in flux in 2020. After COVID-19 tanked the economy, lots of firms played it cautious and slashed salaries. Now that things have largely settled, at least in the legal industry, more and more firms are reversing those cuts. And since transparency is paramount and folks are eager for information as they try to figure out exactly what is going across the industry, we’ll be covering all of the ups and downs that might come to Biglaw.

The latest firm to reverse course on salary cuts is Fisher Phillips.

[Back in April,](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-200-firm-takes-carving-knife-to-salaries/) Fisher Phillips announced salary cuts across the board with no end date. Associates and salaried staff had their paychecks cut by 20 percent, while hourly staff members had their hours cut by 20 percent, and those who are unable to work remotely were furloughed. Partners also took a pay cut, though the exact amount was unknown.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Though the cuts were for an indefinite period of time, tipsters at the firm report that after four months, Fisher Phillips is done with the austerity measures. Salaries will be fully restored “effective in the second half of August.” And decisions on bonuses/true-up payments will be made at the end of the year.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

Yesterday’s piece on the [wildly disparate cost of living](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/?rf=1) facing associates in a variety of newly enriched markets really touched some nerves.

Most of them in Dallas.

Given the volume of social media discussion of the piece, it seems as though a follow-up is in order to address some particular criticisms.

Plus, we get to look at some more houses.

We’ll tackle four broad critiques, which are all, in a sense, related. You can use the link to jump to the specific complaint that interests you the most:

1. [The “Dallas” (or Charlotte) house chosen for the article was completely wrong;](#Dallas)
2. [It’s unfair to pick apartments in the city for some markets and suburban locales for others;](#Cities)
3. [No young associate would really buy something that maxed out their budget;](#Buy) and,
4. [Associates outside NY really do deserve more money, and I’m a jerk.](#Deserve)

1. The “Dallas” House Sucks

First things first. A lot of people hate on the “Dallas” house. The major complaint is its location North of the city:

* No self-respecting big law associate would live in Murphy unless they grew up there.

* The “Dallas” house is so far out of Dallas that no one would live there and work downtown at a firm making $180,000! Dramatic, but unrealistic. I had to look on Google maps to figure out where Murphy, Texas even is.

* Lastly, the house you have for Dallas is about an 1.5 hour commute to work for any associate at a big law firm. Everyone lives in the city where 650k will get you something decent, but the house you showed would be 2.5MM in Dallas and not in the burbs.

By the way, this exercise has taught me that none of you have any idea how long commuting takes. I also heard claptrap about the Charlotte house being “1.5 hours each way in traffic.” I get the impulse to massively expand the time you expect something to take if you don’t want to do it. I do the same thing any time someone invites me to a party above 14th Street. But, as I’ve learned to my detriment, it’s a tactic increasingly undermined by the Internet and smartphones. Google Maps uses smartphones to track traffic and offers a pretty solid report on the true state of any commute.

Thankfully Google Maps can settle these disputes because it tracks traffic in real-time. During rush hour today and last night, both the Murphy house in Texas and the Monroe home in Charlotte were less than 50 minutes each way in traffic. That seems like a long commute, however that’s not too far off of the commute one would undertake to get from that Williamsburg Brooklyn apartment to Cravath (32-40 minutes depending on catching the train).

Now, obviously a first year in Dallas or Charlotte would probably pay less for a very nice apartment 5-10 minutes away from the office. First, the point of the exercise is what they theoretically could purchase without being too far and holding commutes — reasonably — constant. Second, this actually would just get at the argument from another direction if I had to say “for that super ritzy $300K townhouse 10 minutes from work, a New Yorker would spend $640K to live 40 minutes away! However we choose to go at it, the point remains that the same nominal amount in Texas is much, much more than in New York whether it’s spent in Murphy or in your pocket around the corner from the office.

Thus, I thought a 45-minute commute was fair game. Apparently everything’s bigger in Texas except the patience for a commute.

Another tipster thought the peculiarities of Dallas should change the whole equation:

The effective property tax rate here is about 2.2 percent, which drives down what you can afford substantially from your assumption of 0.8. Homeowner’s insurance is not so cheap here, owing to hail, tornadoes, etc. I would say at least $2500/yr for the price range you are talking about –not the $800 Zillow defaults to. That brings you down to about $500,000 on the Zillow affordability calculator.

Maybe re-run your search for homes north of downtown, south of I-635, east of the Dallas North Tollway and West of US-75 with the new $500,000 budget… and see what you come up with.

Well, sure. But I also never really claimed to provide a proper analysis of each market. Many NY apartments involve persnickety busy-bodies demanding that you prove you have massive amounts of capital, the Chicago apartments didn’t include condo fees, the tax rates were always rough guesstimates (even after you consider I was also trying to play with the effective rate rather than sticker price).

However, given the particular annoyance at the Dallas example, we’ll re-run it with the location and amounts (as near as we can get) suggested.

This falls just outside of I-75, but it’s not too far off. And it’s $479K [so we’ll run with it](http://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/Dallas-TX/26868203_zpid/38128_rid/5-_beds/400000-500000_price/1422-1778_mp/size_sort/32.898272,-96.730735,32.879353,-96.76893_rect/14_zm/?3col=true).



The kitchen feels outdated, but there are cabinets for days so there’s that:



Check out the hearth and… is that a 3 Season room back there?



So it’s not as extravagant, but here’s a cheaper, closer example of Dallas home. I hope now that there’s no longer any reason for the good people of Baja Oklahoma to be mad at me…

The rest of the complaints continue on the next page…

# Bad Timing Alert: Layoffs Follow Raises

When we said “[Dear Biglaw Firms, Please Don’t Raise Salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/)” we raised the grim prospect of a firm moving too fast and putting themselves in a bad financial spot. If bumping your salaries requires showing a bunch of your staff the exit, then maybe you don’t need to be racing to keep up with the Cravath-eses.

On the other hand, a firm could lay off staff for reasons wholly unrelated to its announced salary bump. There’s such a thing as too much staff even if a firm can easily afford it. But to start slimming down [one day after raising associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/monday-night-money-party-another-firm-announces-salary-hikes/) to match Cravath’s figure? That’s just terrible, terrible timing.

Last night, we started hearing reports out of Bracewell:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Staff layoff train is rolling through at Bracewell today, day after raises, lots of secretaries being walked out.

Pretty deep cuts, word on the street is no one wants the summers to see.

There’s a pretty easy way to keep the summers from seeing this… wait until September. Assuming the additional staff isn’t breaking the bank — which it must not have been, if the firm’s able to raise attorney salaries starting next month — it’s a small price to pay to keep up appearances.

When reached for comment, a firm spokesperson explained:

Our recent decisions regarding administrative personnel were the result of a thoughtful planning process designed to bring our support staff ratios in line with our peers.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
One has to assume Bracewell had this day circled on the calendar for layoffs all along, and the Cravath-induced fire drill was just an unlucky happenstance. Perhaps, but that’s when the firm has to consider the optics. Walking your more seasoned yet lower-paid staff to the door past some 23-year-olds working their first grownup job (if you can call being a summer a “job”) and glowing about pulling down $3500/week is a recipe for bitterness. The staff feels bad that they’re getting tossed for punks and the associates feel bad that their hard-earned raises hurt people they know. Even if the layoffs are completely unconnected.

We wish all of the legal professionals affected at Bracewell the best of luck while they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, then you really should be letting us know.

Trust no one. That may sound harsh, but literally everyone is evaluating you – even your mentors and the partner who has known you forever.

— [Matthew Mohn](https://www.reedsmith.com/matthew_mohn/), a partner in Reed Smith’s corporate and transactional advisory group, offering [advice for summer associates](https://bol.bna.com/perspective-the-summer-associates-survival-guide/) on how they can succeed during their “three-month interview.” Mohn also suggests that summer associates arrive early and stay late, have a great attitude, get things right on the first (or second) try, and try to have fun. Click [here](https://bol.bna.com/perspective-the-summer-associates-survival-guide/) to see Mohn’s full list of suggestions.

# Layoffs Instead Of Special Bonuses? Biglaw Firms Strike Fear Of Unemployment Into Associates' Hearts
## Where are the special bonuses? They might not be coming after all....

Earlier this week, we provided [special coverage](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/biglaw-firm-announces-summer-special-bonuses/) of what we believe was the first firm to hand out special bonuses to associates this summer. Littler, an Am Law 100 firm, handed out special bonuses that averaged $10,000 to eligible associates who were on a 2,100-hour pace at the end of June. It’s been about a full business week since we publicized those special bonuses, and to our knowledge, not a single other firm has matched or even hinted at handing out special bonuses to associates.

A source at a top Am Law firm reached out to us to let us know why they think this could be. “Firms continue to crush associates,” our tipster said. “They want us to feel ‘grateful.'” And what should associates be grateful for? That they’re still employed at the firm, of course. Our informant thinks that Biglaw partners are socking away cash without sharing the wealth and instilling fear of layoffs in associates. “I see too many colleagues suffering and struggling under the merciless hands of greedy partners in the Biglaw setting,” they said.

Things are getting bad in Biglaw. I am a midlevel associate at an Am Law 20 firm and all I see are partners using the economy as an excuse to drive fear into all of us — just so they can extract every last ounce of flesh (dignity, health, outlook) from associates.

The partners are using media highlight reels of a pending recession, inflation, and layoffs to make us work harder than ever before, and that’s saying A LOT after what they had us do in 2021. My entire group is clocking in rates just as high, if not higher, than what we were doing in 2021. The relentless pressures have not waned in the slightest. Things are even worse now because of the added pressures we have in our personal lives (rising rents, grocery bills, car payments, geopolitical uncertainty and distress, foreign wars, pending student loans, etc.).

At least in 2021 we were shown some appreciation in the form of special bonuses that came trickling in throughout the year. But in 2022, the firms have replaced special bonuses with fear, intimidation, and gamesmanship. We all see what these partners are doing: they are using fear to drive the associate-powered gulag. We are all concerned that they will simply pack away the cash, to ensure their own well-being, and then toss us all aside using stealth layoffs — the stench of pretense (in the form of “poor work performance”) has already started to ruminate.

For firms to continue to rake in the cash and not share it with the workforce that allows them to get rich is wrong.

Increasingly, innovative legal technology is emerging from an incongruous breeding ground — large law firms. And the firms that are incubating these companies are most likely to be found not in the U.S., but in the U.K.

Three of these incubators have been in the news lately, as they have announced their second startup cohorts, and all are based in London: [Fuse](http://www.allenovery.com/advanceddelivery/fuse/Pages/default.aspx), a tech innovation space opened by [Allen & Overy](http://www.allenovery.com/) last September; [MDR LAB](https://lab.mdr.london/), founded in May 2017 by [Mishcon de Reya](https://www.mishcon.com/); and [Fintech Fast Forward](http://www.slaughterandmay.com/what-we-do/legal-services/industry-sectors/fintech/fintechfastforward), launched in March 2017 by [Slaughter and May](http://www.slaughterandmay.com/).

Fuse head Shruti Ajitsaria.

Allen & Overy’s Fuse is a tech innovation space where companies, Allen & Overy lawyers, technologists, and clients can collaborate to explore, develop, and test legal, regulatory, and deal-related technologies. It is run by [Shruti Ajitsaria](http://www.allenovery.com/people/en-gb/Pages/Shruti-Ajitsaria.aspx), a lawyer who conceived of the idea when attending Google’s startup school for moms while on maternity leave.

[The companies selected](http://www.allenovery.com/news/en-gb/Pages/Second-group-of-tech-companies-confirmed-to-join-Fuse-in-May.aspx) to be part of its second cohort and move into its space this month are:

- [Bloomsbury AI](http://bloomsbury.ai/), a company that uses natural language understanding, cognitive capabilities and machine learning to create virtual assistants that can be taught to read, reason, and communicate.
- [Kira Systems](https://kirasystems.com/), which provides machine learning technology for document review and analysis.
- [Neota Logic](https://www.neotalogic.com/), a company whose AI-powered app development platform enables professionals to build and deploy applications that automate legal expertise, processes, and documents.
- [Regnosys](http://www.regnosys.com/), a fintech company that leverages the open source to deliver “machine executable regulation” and drive radical change in the financial industry’s approach to regulatory compliance.
- [Signal Media](https://signalmedia.co/), a firm that applies AI to millions of content sources — from news media to global regulatory updates — to develop actionable business knowledge and help business manage risks and opportunities.

# Ex-Biglaw Associate Becomes Accidental Millionaire Thanks To Daily Fantasy Sports
## Could this be your way out of Biglaw too?

Picture this: You’re a seventh-year attorney at a Biglaw firm, and you’re getting tired of the never-ending rise and grind that goes along with associate life. You may be raking in a six-figure salary, but you’re exhausted, and you’re longing for change. You want to get out, but you’re not sure how. In what little spare time you have, you turn to playing daily fantasy sports (DFS) on DraftKings. And then, just like that, one football game changes your life forever.

That’s exactly what happened to William Elder Jr., 38, a former Dechert associate. “I’m one of the luckier guys you’ll ever meet,” he says. [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/super-bowl-reminds-lawyer-of-game-that-forever-changed-his-life?context=search&index=6) has the details:

[Elder’s] life suddenly changed—while watching a football game, on Nov. 18, 2018.

Elder’s hometown Philadelphia Eagles [lost 48-7](https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=401030963) to the New Orleans Saints. But the [10 catches for 157 yards and a touchdown](https://theeagleswire.usatoday.com/2018/11/19/saints-rookie-trequan-smith-on-his-performance-vs-eagles-it-was-my-time-to-shine/) by Saints receiver Tre’Quan Smith helped the fantasy [squad](https://www.dfsarmy.com/2018/11/shark-autopsy-report-analyzing-draftkings-milly-maker-lineups-to-make-you-a-better-player-9.html) he assembled [win](http://twitter.com/jeff_mans/status/1064672279601135616) a weekly contest sponsored by DraftKings Inc.

His winnings? One million dollars. That’s why DraftKings, a Boston-based fantasy sports company that [went public last year, ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/draftkings-defies-odds-to-go-public-during-freeze-on-sports)calls the contest the Millionaire Maker.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Elder left Dechert in February 2019, and took some time off to figure out what to do next with his life. He founded BillyVonElds LLC, a DFS consultancy, and spent hours upon hours playing DFS daily so that he could make ends meet. Aside from his million-dollar win, his best single-day win was $40,000. And then along came COVID, which forced him into the world of e-sports. Things were getting difficult, and Elder thought it may be time for yet another career change.

In a happy coincidence, this past May, one of his old Dechert clients, Diffusion, came calling, and a few months later, he became the company’s general counsel.

Elder will receive $250,000 in annual base salary with an initial target bonus equal to 30% of that sum, [according to a Diffusion securities filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1053691/000143774920020264/dffn20200925_8k.htm). He currently owns more than $16,000 in Diffusion stock, per Bloomberg data. …

Diffusion’s employment of Elder has curtailed his DFS activities, he said, although he still manages to squeeze in some games when he has time.

Elder’s got some Super Bowl advice for those who still have time to play DFS: “As part of my DFS stuff I have NFL power rankings. I started doing them about Week 10, right when there’s enough data, and the Bucs have been at the top.”

# MoFo Responds To Explosive Pregnancy Discrimination Lawsuit
## The firm contends there's no 'mommy track' at MoFo.

The Biglaw firm of Morrison & Foerster may have been hit with a[ $100 million gender discrimination lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/mofo-hit-with-100-million-pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1) alleging the firm is little more than an “good old boys’ club” that relegates working mothers to the “mommy track” (and the lawsuit is [only getting bigger](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/more-plaintiffs-added-to-astonishing-pregnancy-and-gender-discrimination-case-against-mofo/)), but that doesn’t mean the firm is taking the allegations lying down. On Friday, the firm filed its [answer to the complaint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tC1beDA1YBtYR501Fbrs2lKfK7VMZ68v/view) as well as a [motion for a judgment on the pleadings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bZ0QTiJREgQT5S7xFcD1dd4o-bQQz9nd/view?usp=sharing).

MoFo is represented by Gibson Dunn in the case, and as [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/02/12/in-mommy-track-lawsuit-mofo-points-to-its-track-record-for-defense/) Law.com, the firm’s position is that each of the career paths of the six Jane Doe plaintiffs was highly individualized and appropriate:

“Morrison is consistent in its commitment to fair and equal treatment of associates and others, without regard to sex, gender or parenting status. It is dedicated to working with each individual associate on his or her unique career path,” the firm’s lawyers wrote. “Setting aside the fact that each Plaintiff was treated fairly, each challenges highly individualized personnel decisions.”

Of Jane Does 1, 2, and 3 who had their seniority “reclassified” after parental leave, the firm says those decisions were made for reasons unrelated to their gender and, besides, being held back from advancing with the rest of your associate class does not mean the end of your advancement at MoFo:

The firm, however, contends that the decisions to reclassify those associates were made for reasons “legitimate and unrelated to sex, gender, or parental status.” The firm also contends that reclassification isn’t “considered a performance failure or deficiency and it is not a black mark on someone’s performance record.”

“Accordingly, the fact that an associate was reclassified has no effect on his or her bonus eligibility. And it does not prevent future advancement—Morrison associates have made partner after being reclassified,” the firm’s lawyers contend.

As for the remaining plaintiffs, the firm said Jane Does 4 and 5 were fired for a “history of performance deficiencies,” while they contend Jane Doe 6’s maternity leave did not impact her career or the fact she was passed over for partner:

“[Jane Doe 6] was hired with the knowledge that she was weeks away from taking maternity leave, and she took two additional maternity leaves during her time at the firm,” the firm’s lawyers wrote. “She was not penalized in any way for doing so.”

Even though the defense’s filings are recent, the plaintiffs have already have their initial response, via Deborah Marcuse of Sanford Heisler Sharp:

“Our plaintiffs are not in a position to know more than we know now,” Marcuse said. “They and we have considerable anecdotal evidence” that MoFo doesn’t live up to the principles it touts, she said.

We’ll continue to follow this case with interest.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

— Justice [Ruth Bader Ginsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg), offering [words of disapproval for Biglaw firms](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202767401884/Ginsburg-Urges-Law-Firms-to-Make-Balanced-Life-Easier-for-Lawyers) that haven’t become more accommodating for lawyers who want a “balanced life,” during a conversation with former U.S. solicitor general [Theodore Olson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Olson) before the D.C. chapter of the [Association of Corporate Counsel](http://www.acc.com/chapters/ncr/index.cfm?eventID=19034).

Amid the “Great Resignation,” subsequent “Great Rehiring,” and an evolving employment landscape, public and private companies can be hyper-focused on finding ways to attract and retain talent. Equity compensation may remain a powerful tool for these businesses; but, is it enough to accommodate the needs of the modern worker?

That is what we set out to explore in The State of Equity Plan Management 2022 Report—a study focused on global public and private company equity plans, and the factors that drive them. Analyzing the survey responses of 400+ employees across various industries, the study identifies the strategies being deployed to help increase equity plan effectiveness.

3 key survey findings:

(1) Equity Remains an Important Recruitment and Retention Tool

(2) But Equity Alone Isn’t Enough to Reduce Workforce Attrition

(3) In Response, Companies are Reevaluating Traditional Equity Plan Design

# Good News Out Of The K&L Gates
## The firm will be getting a nine-figure payout in a contingency-fee case later this year.

The financials of K&L Gates should be golden this year — thanks to a huge contingency-fee win.

A reader recently wrote in to complain that we are “piling on” to [K&L Gates](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/kl-gates/). But extensive coverage of a law firm experiencing noteworthy partner defections isn’t “piling on”; it’s just covering the news. K&L Gates has lost a large number of important partners in recent weeks, and these defections have been covered in many major media outlets, including the American Lawyer, Bloomberg BNA, and Law360.

(What would be unfair would be covering partner departures from K&L Gates while ignoring comparable defections at a peer firm. If you know of a Biglaw firm as prominent as K&L Gates that has experienced as many departures of significant partners, please [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=K%20and%20L%20Gates) and we’ll get on it.)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In our K&L Gates coverage, we’ve mentioned positive developments as well as negative ones. We’ve highlighted the firm’s strong financial position, including its avoidance of debt (note the absence of bank debt in the firm’s [2015 financials](http://www.klgates.com/files/Upload/2015_Firm_Financials.pdf)). And we pointed out that the firm would be getting a [huge payout](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/what-the-kl-is-going-on-ten-more-partners-pass-through-the-gates/) from a contingency-fee case.

How huge? Here’s more info, via Julie Triedman of the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202751791381/KL-Gates-Partners-Made-for-Exits-Despite-210M-Windfall?slreturn=20160210140028):

Late last month, K&L Gates chair Peter Kalis emailed the 1,852-lawyer firm’s partnership with some incredible financial news.

Thanks to a $750 million patent infringement settlement involving client Carnegie Mellon University, Kalis said the firm would receive a whopping $210 million contingency fee award. The windfall amounts to just $55 million less than K&L Gates’ entire net income in 2015, and it is bound to boost partner profits by a substantial margin this year.

One of our sources took it as a sign of trouble at K&L that partners would leave the firm despite having such a bounty headed their way. And some of the defectors took big business with them; according to two former partners, financial-services lawyer Laurence Platt moved over to Mayer Brown with a $30 million book of business. (Platt, who served on the K&L Gates management committee, was viewed by some as a possible successor to Peter Kalis as firm chair.)

But it’s possible that even more partners would have departed if not for the CMU payday, according to [Am Law](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202751791381/KL-Gates-Partners-Made-for-Exits-Despite-210M-Windfall?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=1):

Indeed, some former partners say several others who had considered leaving the firm changed their minds following Kalis’ announcement. “People were saying, ‘I’ll just sit it out this year,’” said one of the former partners.

Sit it out — and collect the cash. Biglaw’s not so bad, is it?

# Biglaw Firm Makes Big Joke Out Of Work/Life Balance
## Does this firm really care about its associates' quality of life? Nope.

As everyone knows, it’s April Fools’ Day. With whoopee cushions galore, this was a day to be celebrated when we were younger, but as adults in the legal profession, the idea of pranking coworkers has lost its appeal in favor of the almighty billable hour.

Out of all of the pomp and circumstance associated with Biglaw, one firm — one of the most prestigious firms in the business, mind you — doesn’t take itself so seriously that it’s above playing a yearly trick on its associates. Each year, the firm sends out an April Fools’ email, which is usually met with a chuckle or two. Unfortunately, this year’s joke was no laughing matter to some of the associates who received it.

The firm in question is Weil Gotshal, and this year, the arbiters of the firm’s annual April Fools’ email decided it would be in good fun to announce a new email policy similar to those considered or adopted in Europe. In France and Germany, for example, emails to employees after work hours have been banned, or may soon be banned. Doesn’t that sound awesome? In a world where Biglaw associates have been directed to [CHECK YOU EMAILS OFTEN](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/10/quinn-emanuel-believes-in-c-b-a-check-blackberry-always/), a respite from constant inbox assaults would be most welcomed.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In its firmwide April Fools’ email, entitled “Important New Email Policy,” Weil purportedly agreed to embrace work/life balance policies similar to those that have been foisted upon firms across the pond. Here’s just a snippet from Weil’s faux email policy:

(1) Email will not be transmitted between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. This will be implemented in the local time zone for each Weil office. This will be the default email setting, subject to opt-outs as described below.

(2) Emails will not be transmitted between 11:00 p.m. Friday and 6:00 a.m. Monday, also implemented in the local time zone for each Weil office and also subject to opt out.

(3) When an employee is on vacation, no emails will be transmitted from 11:00 p.m. on the day prior to start of vacation to 6:00 a.m. on the first day back at work after vacation. All emails during this time will be automatically responded to with a message that the recipient is on vacation and not receiving emails, and the name, email address and telephone number of a designated substitute for the duration of the vacation.

If that sounds too good to be true, it’s because it is. While some employees at Weil took the email seriously at first blush and wrote to us lauding the firm in the hope of policies like this becoming an industry norm, others caught wise to the fact that this was a cruel joke much more quickly — and to say they’re pissed would be an understatement. Here’s a sample of some of the responses we’ve received to Weil’s April Fools’ email:

* Please get ahold of Weil’s April fools email. It’s awful and associates are pissed.

* If this is true, it’s awesome. If it’s a joke, it’s the worst joke of all time. Especially to someone like me who has been billing 12-16 hour days recently and gets a lot of late night and weekend emails.

* I think associates are annoyed enough that there will be follow up at some point.

* Hopefully if this is a joke, you publishing it will do something to let them know this is a f*cked-up joke.

* April Fools! We don’t really give a shit about you! Now get back to billing.

* You must read the last sentence of this ridiculous email. Weil is making a mockery of our hard work.

What does the last sentence of Weil’s email say? “We are proud to be taking a leadership role in caring about our colleagues’ quality of life.” Wow. We think that says it all.

It’s important for us to note here that year after year, young Biglaw associates chasing the billable hours dragon [work themselves to death](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/06/in-re-the-passing-of-a-skadden-associate/). Their firms politely announce the deaths, mention that the deceased associate was well-liked among colleagues, and then move along, shoving weeks of non-stop billing down the next associate’s throat. If firms like Weil truly cared about their “colleagues’ quality of life,” then a firmwide email like this one — one that borders on offensive and crosses the line on insensitivity — wouldn’t have been sent as a joke. This isn’t funny. No one is laughing at Weil’s “f*cked-up joke.”

When we reached out to Weil for confirmation that their “important new email policy” was a joke, we also wondered whether Weil would like to comment on the fact that its employees were upset that the firm would make a joke out of a policy that would have such a serious, positive effect on work/life balance. The firm very quickly told us that this was, in fact, a joke, but never responded to our other, more important inquiry.

In the end, we all know that working in Biglaw can be incredibly stressful, and in some cases, deleterious to your health. What’s important to remember is that no one — not even a firm that purports to care about your quality of life — is going to care about your well-being as much as you do. As is evident here, work/life balance is just a joke to them. Please take care of yourselves, associates, because we’re sorry to say that your firm won’t.

UPDATE (4:30 p.m.): It seems that management at Weil Gotshal finally realized that this April Fools’ joke wasn’t very funny. [Barry Wolf](http://www.weil.com/people/barry-wolf), the firm’s executive partner, issued this email in response to the many complaints received throughout the day.

# Lessons Learned From The Demeaning Comments Women Lawyers Deal With All Too Frequently

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I learned that female lawyers struggle daily with misogyny and micro—and sometimes macro— aggressions. This is something that needs to be discussed and addressed more often. If you see something, as a male lawyer, say something. Be an ally and improve the situation.

— [Francisco “Frank” Ramos Jr.](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/elon-musk-sues-openai-they-make-fun-of-him-and-hire-wachtell/), a partner with Clarke Silverglate, in comments given to [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2024/03/08/little-lady-women-lawyers-describe-most-insulting-comments/) following his publishing of a [post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/miamimentor_if-youre-a-female-lawyer-what-was-the-most-activity-7169789809861865472-bQGd/) where he asked, “If you’re a female lawyer, what was the most insulting comment a male lawyer or a male judge made directed to you?” Ramos received over 100 responses from women in the legal profession who described the most disparaging comments they’d ever received from male lawyers and judges.

This morning we mentioned a major Financial District Biglaw firm is [moving out of the neighborhood](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/morning-docket-05-05-16/). What was the first Biglaw firm (then called “Wall Street Firms”) to ditch downtown and move to Midtown Manhattan?

Hint: The firm moved from 61 Broadway to 575 Madison Avenue (which isn’t where it resides today).

# Second Firm Matches The New Milbank Salary Scale
## Associates at the firm are very happy.

Well, well, well, if it isn’t the second firm to match [Milbank’s new salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/). The Biglaw market seems to be moving reasonably quickly in response to Milbank’s move to $215,000 in first-year associate compensation.

Just a few short hours after the associate salary raises were announced, yet another firm is stepping up to the plate and matching the new market standard. McDermott Will & Emery just tossed its hat in the ring to announce the firm will be bumping up associate salaries by $10,000 – $20,000, depending on class year. If you recall, McDermott was the [first firm to match](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/we-have-our-first-match-of-the-new-biglaw-compensation-scale/) Milbank’s largesse this past summer.



(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from McDermott.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Former Prosecutor And Law Professor Arrested For Solicitation
## Prosecutor finds himself on the wrong side of overzealous overcharging.

A former Assistant United States Attorney and Massachusetts Assistant Attorney General was arrested last week “on charges related to soliciting prostitution,” [according to Live Boston 617](https://liveboston617.org/2022/04/29/prominent-boston-lawyer-former-assistant-u-s-attorney-and-current-b-c-law-professor-arrested-on-methadone-mile-for-sex-crimes-update-2/) and the [Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/04/29/metro/prominent-attorney-charged-with-soliciting-prostitute-after-arrest-parking-garage/).

Bruce Singal, currently a partner at Hinckley Allen who also lists an adjunct position at Boston College on his resume [UPDATE: Looks like my phrasing here was correct, because whatever he says, BC claims they haven’t employed him], allegedly picked up a woman from a less than reputable area of town and was confronted by police while being… um… you know, by the woman. According to the report the woman received $40 for the transaction.

The [incident report](https://i0.wp.com/liveboston617.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_7422-1.jpg?w=1248&ssl=1) is tagged “Human Trafficking” which… was a hell of a leap. Indeed, the Globe reports that this charge was later amended downward from the police’s opening salvo to misdemeanor solicitation.

While it’s certainly possible that a sex worker is a victim of human trafficking there’s no basis for taking that as the default assumption. Elevating every sex worker to a human trafficking victim from the outset of an investigation is [a well-known problem](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6746680/) and a mindset that law enforcement cultivates to continually justify massive operations like these.

That said, whenever a prosecutor is pinched in a situation like this, it merits at least a moment to dwell on the importance of prosecutors taking a step back — like the prosecutors in this case seem to have — before aggressively going to the hilt on criminal charges and taking law enforcement assertions on faith.

George T. Conway III

On Wednesday evening, [George T. Conway III](http://www.wlrk.com/GTConway/) — leading litigator, longtime partner at Wachtell Lipton, and husband of Kellyanne Conway, senior adviser to President Donald Trump — sent a letter to the White House withdrawing from consideration to lead the Civil Division of the Department of Justice. Conway, also a [finalist](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/the-latest-in-the-solicitor-general-sweepstakes/) for the post of U.S. Solicitor General, emerged as the presumptive pick for assistant attorney general of the Civil Division [back in March](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/a-wachtell-lipton-partner-joins-the-trump-administration/?rf=1).

Conway shared news of his withdrawal with friends and colleagues earlier this week. Here’s his statement explaining his reasons:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I am profoundly grateful to the President and to the Attorney General for selecting me to serve in the Department of Justice. I have reluctantly concluded, however, that, for me and my family, this is not the right time for me to leave the private sector and take on a new role in the federal government. Kellyanne and I continue to support the President and his Administration, and I look forward to doing so in whatever way I can from outside the government.


It seems that the Conways have their hands full (photo of Kellyanne Conway, George Conway, and their twins, via Kellyanne Conway’s Twitter feed).

Conway’s decision to withdraw from the process for family concerns makes sense. He and Kellyanne have four children and two demanding jobs. Their life after the election — splitting time between D.C. and New York, with Kellyanne logging long hours in the White House and George looking after the kids (while still working at Wachtell, a [famously demanding](https://abovethelaw.com/2006/12/associate-bonus-watch-wachtell-lipton-windfalls/) firm) — has been hectic, to say the least.

While eminently understandable, Conway’s decision met with surprise and disappointment at both the White House and the Justice Department. The Trump administration has been filling the DOJ’s ranks [with superstars](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/a-deep-drive-into-the-department-of-justice-transition/), like Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand, and Conway — one of the nation’s top civil litigators, a graduate of Harvard College and Yale Law School, and a former law clerk to the renowned Judge Ralph Winter (2d Cir.) — would have been a great addition to the roster.

This is admittedly speculative on my part, but I can’t help wondering whether factors other than family considerations might have contributed to Conway’s decision. First, I suspect that the slowness of the selection and vetting process might have dampened his enthusiasm. He was identified as the likely AAG for Civil back in March, and it’s now June. (Indeed, the delay in officially announcing his nomination led me to wonder [earlier this week](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/lawyerly-lairs-george-and-kellyanne-conways-8-million-mansion/) whether he might be having second thoughts.)

Second, I’m guessing that D.C. divisiveness — reflected, for example, in disappointingly party-line votes for superbly qualified nominees like Rachel Brand (52-46) and Sixth Circuit Judge Amul Thapar (52-44) — probably made Conway less than thrilled about enduring the highly partisan process of Senate confirmation (not a fun experience even in good times, and positively unpleasant today). As a longtime partner at a top law firm where profits per partner hover around [$6 million a year](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/), Conway might very well have thought, “I don’t need this s**t.”

Finally, it’s quite possible that recent turmoil in the Trump administration played a role in Conway’s choice. In the past few weeks, several individuals have either left the Trump administration or withdrawn from consideration to join it, including [Michael Dubke](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/us/politics/trump-dubke-white-house-staff-changes.html), who stepped down as White House communications director; [James Donovan](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/business/dealbook/james-donovan-nominee-treasury-backs-out.html), who withdrew from consideration as deputy Treasury secretary; and at least [half a dozen people](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/28/trump-russia-scandal-government-lawyer-hiring-238887) who interviewed for the post of FBI director. Recent pieces in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/us/politics/trump-dubke-white-house-staff-changes.html) and [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/31/russia-investigation-trump-appointees-238954) claim that the ongoing investigations into Trump associates’ contacts with Russia are deterring qualified individuals from government service.

With DOJ service off the table, what’s next for George Conway? If I were in his shoes, I’d angle for an appointment to the Second Circuit, the great appellate court for which he once clerked. As I noted last month in my [nationwide round-up of possible circuit-court nominees](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/circuit-court-nominees-in-the-trump-administration-a-nationwide-round-up/), there are two open New York seats on that court, and not many contenders. (The only name I’ve heard as a serious candidate is Judge Richard J. Sullivan (S.D.N.Y.); if you’ve heard of others, [let me know](mailto:dlat@abovethelaw.com?subject=Judicial%20Nominations).)

It could be tricky at first for the Conways to split their time between New York and Washington, but over the long term, assuming they eventually want to return to the New York area after Kellyanne’s White House service, a life-tenured federal judgeship based out of Manhattan would be perfect. The pay cut isn’t a problem; the Conways are worth [tens of millions](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-lawyers-in-the-trump-white-house-how-much-are-they-worth-part-1/), and retired Wachtell partners get [generous benefits](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/08/retired-wachtell-partners-playmate-denied-share-in-hefty-pension-benefits/). And concerns expressed by some over excessively close ties between the Justice Department and the White House, with George at the DOJ and Kellyanne in the White House, wouldn’t apply if George took the bench (although he might have to recuse from certain cases, like the [Emoluments Clause case](http://www.sdnyblog.com/suit-challenges-president-trumps-business-holdings-under-emoluments-clause/) filed in the Southern District of New York).

So that’s the latest exciting news from the nation’s capital. Say what you will about the Trump administration, but it’s definitely not boring.

UPDATE (3:38 p.m.): I was asked [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jessekodadek/status/870717905335230465) whether George Conway could get retirement benefits from Wachtell Lipton if he took the bench. I believe he could. Before joining the S.D.N.Y., Judge Katherine Forrest [disclosed such benefits](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/05/correction-ex-cravath-partner-nominated-to-s-d-n-y-is-pretty-stinking-rich/) coming from Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Mary Jo White, as she left Debevoise & Plimpton to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, similarly disclosed that the firm would liquidate her retirement benefits and [pay them out as a lump sum](http://bit.ly/XHjB5h). (Conway would of course have to recuse on any Wachtell Lipton cases anyway.) [UPDATE (6/3/2017, 9:53 a.m.): Some judges recuse in matters involving their former firm and partners, and it’s often prudent, but it’s not always required.]

UPDATE (6/5/2017, 1:14 p.m.): It sounds like Conway feels pretty good about his decision this Monday morning. See [Trump Proves His Own Lawyers Have Been Lying To The Courts Regarding The ‘TRAVEL BAN’](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/trump-proves-his-own-lawyers-have-been-lying-to-the-courts-regarding-the-travel-ban/) (and the Conway tweet embedded therein).

# Biglaw Partner's Suspension Quadrupled On Appeal Following Fraudulent Billing Scandal
## The order says 'clients were intentionally, dishonestly, and excessively billed for the time.'

Doreen Zankowski

Timesheets are the bane of almost every law firm attorney’s life. Keeping track of your work time in six-minute increments can be a time-consuming and tedious affair. We all know it’s important since that’s how firms get paid, but that doesn’t mean an attorney can be lax in their ethical obligations.

[Back in 2019, ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/biglaw-partners-legal-license-suspended-for-overbilling/)we told you about the hot water Duane Morris partner Doreen Zankowski was in. The issue stems from her time at Saul Ewing — specifically her time entry in 2015, the year she made equity partner. Zankowski billed 3,173 hours and worked more than 720 non-billable hours that year, but during a compensation review, the firm became concerned with her hours. And though Zankowski left Saul Ewing in 2016 and joined Duane Morris, the investigation into her timesheets continued.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
According to the initial ethics opinion, Zankowski “falsely inflated the number of hours on final bills sent to several clients, improperly entered her time as work by her associates, and knowingly billed clients for taking depositions that she did not attend.” And though the board of bar overseers recommended a two-year suspension, Associate Justice Frank Gaziano felt that was “too severe” and knocked it down to six months. In justifying the shorter suspension, Gaziano also noted even absent the billing irregularities, Zankowski was a significant revenue generator and that her evidence that the overbilling was unintentional was compelling.

But after an appeal to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, the suspension was quadrupled to two years, [as reported by](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1368800/duane-morris-atty-banned-2-years-for-overbilling-at-ex-firm) Law360:

[Associate Justice David A.] Lowy — writing for a four-judge panel of the top court — increased the penalty to two years on Thursday.

“Our focus, however, is not on the quantum of excessive fees that were billed, but on the fundamental dishonesty inherent in the respondent’s client billings themselves,” Justice Lowy wrote. “It is not the sheer number of unworked hours that establishes the misconduct but, rather, the dishonesty manifested by billing for them at all.”

In addition to padding her own hours, Zankowski also faced criticism for adding billable hours for associates who worked for her. She said that time added was for work Zankowski actually did and she simply added it to associates’ time to avoid the effort of creating an entry for herself, and also to discount the work to an associate’s rate. But this order takes a more hardline approach, eviscerating Zankowski’s justification of adding 350 hours to associates’ timesheets noting, “even if the work was done, it was not done by the attorney identified on the bill.” And it goes on:

“On twelve different dates, if the hours the respondent claimed she worked but attributed to associate attorneys were added to the hours the respondent billed under her own name (which the respondent testified would have been the correct allocation of time), she would have worked more than twenty-four hours,” the order states.

And the order calls out Zankowski’s actions as intentional dishonesty:

“Although the respondent testified that the additional hours reflected her own time spent working on those matters, the hearing committee declined to credit the testimony, finding instead that the clients were intentionally, dishonestly, and excessively billed for the time,” Justice Lowy wrote.

Zankowski’s attorney, Thomas Mullen, said, “All I can say is I am very disappointed with the decision.”

# The Best (And Most Unexpected) Pandemic Perk Yet: Naptime
## Will your law firm let you take a break to nap during working hours?

For more than 18 months, lawyers and legal professionals have been going into overdrive while working from home, pushing law firm revenue sky high . There can be no more work-life balance when work has invaded your home; work simply is life. When working from before the sun rises to well after the sun has set, can anyone really fault an exhausted attorney for taking a short afternoon snooze?

With a new focus on wellness throughout the pandemic, napping may become part of law firm culture, whether some like it or not.

[Law.com](https://www.law.com/2021/10/11/does-a-law-firms-new-normal-have-room-for-an-afternoon-nap/) has zeroed in on the trend, and at least one managing partner has taken advantage of this unexpected pandemic perk:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Matt Haverstick, managing partner for litigation at Philadelphia midsize firm Kleinbard, naps everyday.

“One aftereffect of Covid is that it laid bare that our work, especially at a high level, transcends normal work hours. And when we had the chance to be at home for so long, it made it easier for our work lives to accommodate this truth,” he said in an email. “For instance, a lot of mornings I’m up at 4 working, which was even easier to do during Covid. I am much more productive in the afternoon and evening if I’ve given myself a break in the middle of the day.”

Other partners, however, seem a little wary of the midday nap:

[S]ome lawyers who enjoy a siesta find that it doesn’t fit into their workday. K&L Gates partner David Fine, who has been back in his Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, office since March, fits naps into his weekend routine. But he avoided them in the year that he was working remotely, fearing that he’d be unproductive after waking.

“They’re just too disruptive,” he said, while acknowledging that earlier in his career, he’d joked with colleagues about the virtue of regularizing a postlunch nap in the office.

Biglaw firms, on the other hands, seem to have bought into the necessity of naps. Akin Gump, for example, offers meditation rooms in some of its offices, complete with lounge furniture or floor mats, while Morrison & Foerster has wellness rooms in each of its U.S. offices. According to Marie Armstrong-Hebert, the firm’s director of public relations, “They are designed to allow employees to recharge—including by napping—in a private and welcoming area.” (One former MoFo associate admitted that these rooms were most often used for the the “I’ve been here for days and hours without sleep and will collapse scenario,” which just goes to show how truly important sleep is for those in the legal profession.)

For our money, it seems like Haverstick is on point. “Forward-thinking employers should be encouraging midday check-out sessions,” he said. If you want your lawyers and staff to bring their best, perhaps it’s time to encourage more sleep — even if that means napping during working hours.

You just won a big defense judgment!  You’re a hero!

The world will learn about this! You’ll add this victory to your firm bio.  Clients will retain you left and right! Surely this victory will jumpstart the rest of your career.

“The American Lawyer” will want to name you the Litigator of the Week. Your firm will be in contention for the Litigation Department of the Year award.

This is great! Let’s publicize the win!

Then you speak to your client. (You do speak to the client, don’t you, before your firm’s publicity machine cranks into action?) The lawsuit was against the client, after all. It’s the client’s case, and the client paid the exorbitant fees your firm charged for the privilege of you trying the case.

The client prefers that you not publicize the victory at trial.

What’s that damnable client thinking?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It does a client only a tiny amount of good to publicize a defense judgment at trial. Maybe — maybe — some future plaintiff’s lawyer will do some internet research about the client, decide that the client has the gumption to try occasional big cases to judgment, and thus decide not to sue. But that’s a very small, and possibly nonexistent, benefit.

On the other hand, it does a client a fair amount of harm to be associated with litigation. If your client is a corporate defendant, then the fact that a case was filed probably reflects poorly on the client. Someone thought that the client’s drug was designed improperly and hurt someone; that the construction work was shoddy, causing the roof to leak; that the physician’s services were not up to snuff, causing someone to suffer injury. By definition, your client was a defendant; is it really good for a corporate defendant’s name to be associated with litigation (successful or no)?

So think twice before instinctively sending press releases out to the world and shouting about your victory from the mountaintops.

It’s true that you won. It’s true that the defense judgment is a feather in your cap. It’s true that you want to brag about the victory to generate fame and possible fortune.

But you’re not the only one with skin in this game.

Consider trial victories from the corporate defendant’s perspective, and you may understand why publicizing your victory is not necessarily in your client’s best interest.

Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer is one of the largest firms in the world, is known for being a trendsetter, and tends to outperform its peers.

That said, I’ll try to keep their intent in mind as I share with you their new bonus table.

# Stand-Up Appellate Work
## Why would someone who had real appellate experience need help from someone in the firm's appellate practice?

Assume that my company won a trial.

(You can stop cheering now. Or looking surprised. I’m just stating the hypothetical.)

The lead trial lawyer was a fairly senior person who had, years ago, worked as a federal appellate clerk. In the time since, the person had served as both trial and appellate counsel in many cases.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When the time came to brief the appeal in my case, the lawyer asked if someone from the firm’s appellate practice could help with the appeal.

I was a little surprised. I understand the wisdom of adding a former appellate clerk (or judge) to an appellate team when people on the trial team have no appellate experience. Appellate clerks might understand, deep in their souls, the meaning of “standard of review” in a way that others do not. Appellate clerks can be helpful framing subtle jurisdictional or waiver issues. And a recent, local appellate clerk — someone who clerked in the Seventh Circuit last year, and your case is headed for the Seventh Circuit — might know things about the judges that are uniquely helpful.

But, where none of those circumstances apply, why would someone who had real appellate experience need help from someone in the firm’s appellate practice?

I posed this question by email. The answer was multipronged: The appellate person was smart, the appellate person had added value in other cases, and so on.  But the last prong struck me as bent: The appellate person has had more “stand-up appellate experience than I have.”

“Stand-up appellate experience” was a new one on me.

I’ve heard of “stand-up trial experience.” I know what that means. And it counts.

Trials can be long. They often last for several days (or more).

During a trial, unexpected things happen. A witness says something unexpected; it helps if you’ve seen, and reacted, to similar unexpected things in the past. The other side objects in a way that you didn’t anticipate. At that point, you can’t be gasping for air; your instincts must be good. The judge decides that a document might be admissible; “counsel should lay a little more foundation.” I don’t want trial counsel who has only book-learning about the meaning of the word “foundation.” I want someone who knows in his or her heart what a judge who asks for more foundation is looking for and can provide that foundation in the next four, unscripted, questions. Experience counts.

But “stand-up appellate experience”?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Let me rule out practice in the U.S. Supreme Court, which may be unique. In the Supreme Court, you’re always arguing to the same nine justices, and those justices have set out their views repeatedly over time. A person who argued a couple of times in the First Circuit, and then once in appellate court in Kansas, may not be the right person to argue in the Supreme Court. (Then again, maybe that’s just a fiction perpetuated by the Supreme Court bar. First-time advocates frequently do a very nice job before the Supreme Court.)

But think about other appellate courts. In the typical federal appellate court, you have a randomly selected panel of three judges. You may or may not have advance knowledge of who those judges will be. Given time, anyone can do the research to see if a judge on your panel has written an opinion in the relevant area of law (and that you didn’t cite in the briefs). Nothing specialized helps here.

Moreover, in a sense, appellate arguments are easy.  They are short. They might run for fifteen minutes per side. They can very largely be scripted.

The record is established. The relevant authorities have been cited, and the advocates have read them. With decent preparation, an advocate will anticipate the questions the panel might ask. (I was in private practice for 25 years. During that time, I was asked only one question by an appellate judge that I hadn’t anticipated in advance.) The advocate could, and should, have rehearsed both the uninterrupted argument and the responses to likely questions. Not much happens in appellate arguments that come from out of left field.

So “stand-up appellate experience” as a reason to add an appellate lawyer to an otherwise capable trial team?

It sounds like a silly phrase to me.

But we’ll see what reaction I get to this column.

# Lawyer-Client Relationships: Healthy Or Tinder?
## One of the most challenging aspects of running a law firm or law department is the classic problem of all buyers and sellers: how do you get and sustain a good deal?

One of the most challenging aspects of running a law firm or law department is the classic problem of all buyers and sellers: how do you get and sustain a good deal? On Tuesday, [Buying Legal Council’s](http://www.buyinglegal.com/) “Professional Sourcing and Management of Legal Services” conference addressed that dilemma—and the answers, which include understanding the dating site Tinder and diving into analytics.

The day-long event, held at Proskauer’s Times Square office in New York City, included a morning panel called “TED-style Talks: Managing (Supplier) Relationships.”

[Mark Cohen,](http://legalmosaic.com/about-mark-a-cohen/) founder and CEO of Legal Mosaic, went first, and had the audience laughing from the start when he compared the law firm/in-house dynamic to how people answer the “Relationship Status” question on Facebook. “Legal delivery has gone from ‘In a Relationship’ to ‘It’s complicated,'” he said.

In the past, buying decisions were made on a golf course, said Cohen, who is based in the Washington, D.C. area. Today’s market is like a bazaar with lots of buyers and sellers, he said.

Beauty contests where corporate counsel would “round up the usual suspects” have been replaced with Requests for Proposals that get longer and longer, Cohen noted. The criteria have expanded, as buyers now consider sellers’ legal expertise, technology, and business processes.

“It’s not just about legal expertise anymore,” said Cohen. “It is a mosaic and a work in progress. One size doesn’t fit all.”

The dating theme escalated when [Joseph “Joe” Leccese](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephleccese), chairman of Proskauer and co-chair of its sports law practice, took his turn and posed the question, “Is there any value to a ‘real’ relationship” with the buyer? And if there is a relationship, is it healthy?”

“You say relationship, but we feel Tinder,” he said, referring to the dating app with a reputation for facilitating hook-ups. “A relationship is the best alternative fee arrangement; a short-term deal of two to three years is not a relationship.”

“A healthy relationship is when two people develop a connection based on mutual respect, trust, honesty, support, fairness-equality, separate identities, good communication, and a sense of playfulness/fondness,” said Leccese, sourcing the list to the Hall Health Center at the University of Washington.

Leccese listed the complaints about Biglaw from would-be buyers:

- Firms won’t change.
- They are not interested in a partnership.
- The can’t deliver “value.”
- Biglaw is “so 2012.”

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Biglaw needs to embrace change, but how that will happen will depend on whether there is a real relationship, not just a transaction, he added.

Leccese also acknowledged that not everything is high end and that it can be challenging to measure value. There are always emergencies. Trust is crucial, he said, and “when disaster strikes, you want a relationship.”

“We need to bring a little more balance,” said Leccese. “It’s in everybody’s interest.”

Leccese turned the discussion to his own firm, noting that Proskauer has changed its delivery model and its hiring and training protocols. The firm is getting leaner. Entry-level associates now go through intense training—including technology and business concepts—over six years. “By the time they complete their training, they’ve got the equivalent of a mini-MBA,” he said.

Assumptions

Next up was [Danny Ertel](https://www.vantagepartners.com/partners/Danny_Ertel.aspx), founder and partner at Vantage Partners, who focused on “the assumptions we make.” The Boston company is a spin-off of the Harvard Negotiation Project.

The buyer/seller process “is not a zero-sum game unless we make it,” said Ertel. Participants need to view the process as if it were a game. Don’t assume that your opponent has to change first, he advised.

Ertel encouraged the audience to consider alternative options and “think outside the box” (a phrase that was ubiquitous throughout the conference). He also urged the audience to explore “preferred customer” programs.

Sophisticated Buyers

The final panel speaker was [Michael Tal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-tal-340b5355), co-founder and co-CEO of [BusyLamp,](http://busylamp.com) technology that monitors legal spending. Based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, Tal previously was a senior associate at White & Case and an associate at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.

Tal urged purchasers to “become sophisticated buyers and use metrics both for short-term issues and long.” It’s crucial to acknowledge outside counsel, he said. Spend time defining your scope and adjusting and leveraging the scope as the engagement continues, he said.

Tal stressed the importance of acknowledging work well done, citing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study that showed that you get more for your buck if you just take the time to praise work done well.

His advice for law firms: Become a “partner” with your client early in the process. “Be more transparent, keep the client alerted to change, use metrics and communicate, give feedback. Results are what matter,” said Tal.

For both sides: Remember, commodity work is not bespoke work.

Other presentations included “Getting a Seat at the Table,” by Susan O’Brien, senior vice president at Bank of America, as well as two workshops and two case studies.

What’s Next

The conference was organized by [Silvia Hodges Silverstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silviahodges), executive director of Buying Legal Council, who presented highlights of an upcoming survey report. Asked what she sees as the top challenge for firms and in-house relationships, she said, “There still is a lot of work to be done on both sides. Procurement must continue to get better insight and data and conduct the right analyses to add value to legal.”

“Legal departments (including  legal operations) are well advised to work with procurement on the business side of the law. Law firms need to embrace a different, more efficient, innovative way of delivering legal services, and be ready to engage with procurement,” said Silverstein.

The event drew 118 attendees, including 23 people in law firms and 65 client-side. Others were consultants, software vendors and suppliers. Sponsors included BusyLamp, UnitedLex, Prosperoware, Q3 Resources, Level 2 Legal Solutions, and FirmWise. Proskauer provided the venue.

Buying Legal Council will hold its next conference in London on May 9: “Alternative / Appropriate Fee Arrangements,” at Baker & McKenzie.

# Law Firms Shouldn't Lay Off Workers Around The Holidays
## The negative perception generated by a law firm terminating employees over the holidays can be felt in a number of ways.

Over the past several weeks, I have heard through the grapevine (and through reading Above the Law) that some law firms laid off people around the holidays. Of course, it is difficult to terminate employees during any time of the year, and law firms need to consider a number of factors when they make the difficult choice to lay off workers. Sometimes, laying off workers during the holidays is unavoidable since law firms cannot wait until after the holidays to lower their headcount. However, there are a variety of reasons why law firms should try their best to avoid terminating employees around the holidays.

Perhaps the biggest reason why law firms should avoid laying off workers around the holidays is that it ruins the holiday season for everyone involved. Workers who are laid off many not be able to enjoy the holiday season since they need to contend with the uncertainty of being without a job. In addition, employees who are laid off may not feel comfortable paying for presents or participating in holiday traditions because of the life situation they now face. The negative feelings that a laid-off worker experiences are also often faced by their family as well since children and spouses also need to contend with the uncertainty caused by losing employment around the holidays.

People who remain in an office may also have a difficult time enjoying the holiday season. Terminations can have a negative impact on morale at an office as empty desks are a constant reminder of people who departed during layoffs. In addition, workers who remain in an office may also have a sense of uncertainty since layoffs usually signal that a law firm is having financial issues which may impact people who have not yet been terminated. In addition, the act of laying off workers can negatively impact those who need to terminate employees, especially if a large number of people need to be let go.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Furthermore, law firms should try not to lay off workers around the holidays since it is harder for terminated employees to find new jobs during the holidays than at other points during the year. Law firms are often less focused on hiring during the holidays than during other parts of the year. This is because law firms usually have holiday parties and other priorities around the holidays that they do not have at other times of the year. In addition, people tend to go on vacation during the holidays, which can make it harder for decision-makers to give their approval for new hires.

Law firms often go to great lengths to try to ensure that terminated workers land on their feet. Indeed, law firms usually offer job replacement services as part of severance packages and lawyers often try to use their network to see if there are open positions at other firms and try to place terminated employees at other shops. Law firms should try not to put terminated employees at a disadvantage by letting them go during a period when it will be more difficult than usual for them to find a new job.

Law firms should also try not to lay off workers during the holidays since it looks really bad when they do so. If law firms terminate people over the holidays, managers at those shops look heartless for ruining the holidays of people that they let go. In addition, since presumably law firms would try at all costs to avoid terminating employees over the holidays, if shops do lay off workers during this time, they may look desperate because they seemingly could not economically avoid laying people off over the holidays.

The negative perception generated by a law firm terminating employees over the holidays can be felt in a number of ways. Attorneys and staff may not want to work at a law firm that terminates employees over the holidays since this may signal that a law firm does not care about its employees or is struggling financially so that they needed to take drastic measures like terminating employees during the holidays. In addition, clients may also not like it when firms terminate employees over the holidays since clients usually like to know they employ firms that treat workers well.

Because of websites like Above the Law and others, numerous people in the legal community will likely find out if a law firm terminates workers over the holidays. This negative press should be avoided whenever possible.

Of course, if employees are terminated for cause or if a law firm really cannot wait to conduct layoffs, then law firms may need to terminate employees during the holiday season. However, to do the right thing and avoid negative press, law firms should try their best not to terminate employees around the holidays.

# Is This Déjà Vu All Over Again?
## One of the suckiest things about being an adult is having to look for work.

Once upon a time, in the “good old days,” tongue firmly in cheek, before 2009 and the stupendous crash (sorry, I call it a crash, but you can call it the “Great Recession” if you prefer), new admittees and associates often had their pick of offers. Then came the turbulent times — I remember them because I am old — and lawyers were whacked unceremoniously. Some were newbies. Some were what the firms called “unproductive,” a term of art. Some newbies had their start dates extended and ultimately cancelled. Cruise through ATL’s archives to see how bad those bad times were. “Brutal” is an understatement. Kathryn Rubino’s post from 2016 reminds us of all [just how bad it was](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/what-the-2009-legal-layoffs-were-really-like/).

Is [the present wave of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/shearman-sterling-associate-layoffs/) “déjà vu all over again?” Just as in 2009, explanations such as “performance issues” are proffered. Please. And just exactly when did those “performance issues” arise? Coincidentally, right at the time that the firm or corporate law department made the decisions to reduce headcount and couldn’t figure out other ways to do it without potentially violating anti-discrimination laws. Any performance evaluations to support the decisions? Any PIPs (performance improvement plans?) What do you think? My thought is that some peeps didn’t want to slice the pie into smaller pieces. Some peeps could stand to lose some weight, but not employees. Is anyone else sick of the phrase “doing more with less?”

Maybe some firms will be willing to [tighten their belts and keep employees](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/cozen-oconnor-promise-no-layoffs/). However, the ability to keep that promise is all dependent on workflow, and if there’s not enough work, then it’s game over. Deferring start dates is just one way of coping with less demand, but [what about succeeding entry classes and their start dates](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/after-layoffs-last-year-cooley-delays-start-date-for-first-year-associates/)? Crunch time. Brand spanking-new lawyers or within a couple years of that were in middle school 15 years ago and so the last thing kids that age at that time thought about was the possibility of lawyer layoffs, let alone figuring out career choices.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Times are different now, or are they? For those of you who either have severance agreements in hand or expect to receive one, please do not act as your own lawyer. Remember that Abe Lincoln is often credited with having said that only a fool has himself for a lawyer, and so far, even Donald Trump at his arraignment took that advice — probably against his own — for lack of a better word, judgment.

I’m not about to provide legal advice, but scrutinize your severance agreement very carefully. It’s in your best interest. And now, [your best interest is what matters](https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-rules-that-employers-may-not-offer-severance-agreements-requiring#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20Board%20issued%20a,the%20National%20Labor%20Relations%20Act.).

One of the suckiest things about being an adult is having to look for work. I don’t think there’s anyone who gets up, gets sufficiently caffeinated, gets to spend hours searching for another job and thinks it’s been a good day. It is mind-numbing, repetitious, soul-sucking, and makes for low self-esteem. Job search rejection is never pretty or uplifting or energizing. It takes life out of you.

And if all these feelings aren’t enough, apparently, it’s [now necessary to have a BS detector](https://lifehacker.com/the-lies-employers-tell-you-during-job-interviews-1850307753?utm_source=lifehacker_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2023-04-10) in the search.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
One of the main points in the article is that recruiters can be, in the words of a former client of mine, “lying sacks of [fill in the blank].” He didn’t leave it blank; I will but you can probably make an educated guess. Recruiters can be Pinocchio to greater or lesser degrees. The first fount of misinformation is the compensation rubric: salary and benefits. In many ways, discussions of these two items are a shell game, leaving you to guess which cup conceals the pea. It can often be a matter of semantics, giving the recruiter an out because of a misunderstanding in language.

Another major kiss-off is “keeping your resume on file.” Have you ever received a callback months or even years after the prior “successful” candidate didn’t work out? I thought so. I did keep one candidate’s resume on file after she interviewed for several positions because they weren’t right for her knowledge and skills, but she was a superstar. When the right position arose, I called her, she interviewed, and we hired her. She was one of the best hires ever and was there for years. It can happen, but I wouldn’t rely on it.

Requests that you provide input on a project are unacceptable grabs for your unpaid advice and knowledge. If you feel you are being taken advantage of, you probably are, and this is just a preview of things to come. Run, don’t walk, away.

Remote work? Hybrid? Again, definitions matter. Is a job totally WFH or will there be requirements for face time? These terms need to be nailed down in the interview process. And it’s possible that the recruiter has already scoped the landscape to assure the employer that it has already chosen and hired the best possible candidate, leaving you to feel both used and abused.

[Layoffs happen anywhere and to anybody](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/11/opinions/careers-workers-prepare-for-layoffs-recession-gavin-ctpr/index.html). No one is immune. It can happen to a newbie, a senior lawyer without a sufficiently substantial book of business, and anyone in between. Layoffs have no mercy, but maybe they should. It could happen to you.

“Everything is gold, everything is equal / Posted on the porch just chilling, me and my people.” — [Macklemore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sJRI4US_I)

On Saturday, the 2022 [A100 List](https://goldhouse.org/a100/) — the annual award honoring the 100 most impactful Asians and Pacific Islanders — manifested into the [first-ever Gold Gala](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/05/23/2448027/0/en/Gold-House-Hosts-Inaugural-Gold-Gala-With-Major-Launches-and-the-Largest-Gathering-of-Top-Asian-Pacific-Islander-Leaders.html) hosted by [Gold House](https://goldhouse.org/), the leading AAPI changemaker community of cultural leaders, executives, and creatives.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The night’s theme was “A New Gold Age” to reflect the current era of unparalleled [AAPI brilliance](https://variety.com/2022/film/news/michelle-yeoh-mindy-kaling-gold-house-gala-1235274588/), even in the face of [continued violence](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/one-year-after-the-atlanta-aapi-shooting-aapi-women-are-being-hunted-in-the-streets/) and[ racism against our community](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/in-the-face-of-asian-american-hate-crimes-congressional-tri-caucus-members-preach-unity-while-other-politicians-sow-the-seeds-of-division/). The gala was hosted in collaboration with Meta as a continuation of their long-standing partnership to grow and celebrate AAPI voices and brands through education, access, and amplification.

The night felt surreal — from talking to others who often felt unseen, to celebrating representation in all its forms. The [Asian diaspora](https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/gold-house-hosts-inaugural-gold-gala-2022) was beautiful. The uplifting of [Asian excellence and heritage](https://variety.com/2022/film/news/michelle-yeoh-mindy-kaling-gold-house-gala-1235274588/) was awe-inspiring. It felt truly special being part of the event, but it’s even better knowing that those who attended were willing to share their time and advice with the Above the Law audience for Asian Pacific American Heritage Month 2022.

Although I had pages of interview notes, I want to highlight these eight quotes in particular:

[Nicole Shanahan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-shanahan-85831b18/), attorney and president at Bia-Echo Foundation: Don’t worry, one day you will pay off your student loans. And don’t get too stressed out about the bar exam, make it fun and you’ll do fine. And believe it not, you’ll leverage your legal background every single day.

[Michelle Wu](https://twitter.com/wutrain?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), attorney and mayor of Boston: You belong.

[Andrew Toy](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login-submit), president and CTO of Clover Health: Get married sooner. And don’t take anything too seriously!

[Henry Golding](https://www.instagram.com/henrygolding/?hl=en), actor: Don’t fret about the small things, backhanded comments, and slights. Be proud of who you are. Celebrate your ancestry, both the Malaysian and British aspects. You got this kid!

[Payal Kadakia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/payalkadakia), CEO and co-founder of ClassPass: Trust the universe in helping your dreams come true.

These quotes were all in response to the same question: “What would you tell your younger self?”

If you would have told me I would be an attorney who went to events where AAPIs were [represented](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/what-do-the-oscars-and-the-legal-profession-have-in-common/) in the [legal industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/diversity-in-the-legal-profession-has-flatlined-since-the-great-recession-who-is-to-blame/), [media industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/framing-the-grammys-education-and-biglaw-with-a-racial-equity-lens/), and [popular culture](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/the-case-for-crazy-rich-asians-and-aapi-representation-in-the-legal-profession/), I simply wouldn’t have believed it. Life has a funny way of continually surprising us. As the saying goes — “If you want to make God laugh, just tell him your plans.”

To be able to celebrate Asian brilliance in the face of an [increasingly hostile environment](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/our-country-is-failing-its-asian-american-senior-citizens-we-must-step-up-to-protect-them/) was an act of rebellion in and of itself. To be able to meet luminaries in our profession and change agents in their respective industries was truly remarkable.

I believe the brotherhood and sisterhood of the AAPI community are now bonding together more than ever and forging a united front in this atmosphere of [relentless attacks](https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/nbc-news-now-and-nbc-asian-america-presents-the-racism-virus-a-candid-conversation-hosted-by-nbc-news-vicky-nguyen). I wonder what a future me would tell myself today. I hope he would grab my shoulder and proclaim: [“The best is yet to come!”](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/started-from-the-bottom-now-were-here-minorities-in-the-legal-profession/)

# 18 Attorneys Jump From Quinn Emanuel, Head To Loving Embrace Of Dechert

Back in May, Quinn Emanuel lost Sheila Birnbaum, who is known as the “Queen of Toxic Torts,” to Dechert, largely due to ongoing conflicts between her practice and the rest of the general litigation practice. Now, [as reported by Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1065497/more-quinn-emanuel-attorneys-leave-firm-for-dechert), comes news that more attorneys are following Birnbaum’s lead.

All in, 18 attorneys and eight staff members are leaving Quinn. Hayden Coleman, Douglas Dunham, and Bert Wolff are the three partners heading to Dechert where they’ll be joined by nine counsel, six associates, three project attorneys, and five paralegals. They join Birnbaum, as well as partners Mark Cheffo and Douglas Fleming III (who left Quinn for Dechert in May), and account for a 7 percent increase in the size of Dechert’s global litigation practice.

Dechert is appropriately thrilled with the pickup:

“We are thrilled to have this marquee team join Dechert’s group of experienced product liability and mass tort litigators,” Dechert chair Andrew Levander said in a statement. “A prestige lateral acquisition of this magnitude cements our firm’s position among the best in the market.”

Quinn just pointed to their statement on Birnbaum’s departure, with no specific comment on the 18 who are now leaving:

Quinn Emanuel declined to comment on the move beyond its May statement, in which managing partner John Quinn said that “over time, our broad and diverse practice has created many conflicts for particular clients we have represented in product liability litigation.”

That may seem cold, but it’s better than an [angry firmwide email](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/john-quinn-is-not-happy-about-selendy-gay-and-he-sent-the-angry-reply-all-to-prove-it/) and [litigation](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/john-quinn-wants-partners-to-regret-leaving-his-firm/).

New year, new salaries! That’s the good news for the associates in the Phoenix office of Perkins Coie. The firm recently announced that the outpost would be getting a raise — between $10,000 and $50,000 depending on performance reviews, billable hours, and seniority.

Before we share the actual numbers, let’s address the elephant in the room — the salary range, even for the best associates billing the most hours, is lower than t[he going market rate](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/) in New York and other major markets. But a raise is a raise is a raise, and Perkins Coie Phoenix associates (as well as attorneys at other Phoenix firms that hope this will force the legal market in the city to move) have to be happy with extra cash.

So, what are Perkins Coie associates making these day? Here’s their handy chart for your reference:

# Another Magic Circle Firm Pulls Money Out Of A Hat

Freshfields was the first Magic Circle firm to announce an associate pay raise, which it did on [June 8](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/magic-circle-firm-matches-cravath-scale/). Clifford Chance announced its own salary increase [the very next day](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/international-firm-brings-its-u-s-associates-up-to-the-new-market/). Ashurst, a Silver Circle firm, announced an associate pay raise [yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-global-firm-matches/).

So it should come as no surprise that Magic Circle member [Allen & Overy](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/allen-overy-llp/) is following suit. We don’t have the memo yet — please send our way, and we’ll update — but we’ve heard the following:

1. A&O is matching the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1) in its two U.S. offices (New York and D.C.), and São Paulo too.

2. It’s matching up through eighth-year associates (class of 2008), meaning the scale goes from $180,000 to $315,000.

3. The effective date is July 1.

All in all, a pretty standard match. Here is one tipster’s reaction:

Happy and excited!

And then there was one….

Making it to midlevel in Biglaw isn’t easy — especially in the wake of a pandemic. First, you had to break into Biglaw (which can be quite difficult, especially if you didn’t go to a top law school or earn top grades). Next, you had to survive the high stress and long hours. Then, you needed to endure and somehow persevere through the incredibly uncertain times COVID-19 brought upon the legal profession and the world at large (though we’re sure the special bonuses and pay raises had to have helped a little). Finally, you had to avoid layoffs while dealing with the return to the office in a post-COVID world, and all of the shenanigans that came along with it.

Phew! That was no easy task, but if you did make it to your firm’s midlevel ranks during the past few years, it was arguably more difficult than ever — and these associates have simply had enough. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/22/how-to-kill-your-culture-in-a-minor-recession-according-to-midlevels/) just released its midlevel associates survey, and as noted by Dan Roe, “measures to right the balance sheet don’t have to kill associate morale when firm leaders are transparent and willing to shoulder some of the burden themselves.” He goes on to explain that unfortunately, that hasn’t exactly been the midlevel experience at all firms:

Law firms are hounding associates on billable hours and getting stingier about expenses. Stealth layoffs are going unacknowledged, breeding panic and resentment among associate ranks. Sensing a labor market advantage, firms are reneging on flexible work policies that helped them land talent and prompted associates’ cross-country moves. At firms where there’s a general sense that things are getting worse, a lack of transparency around these and other decisions only fans the flames.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)

To come up with these results, Am Law asked midlevel associates to evaluate how satisfied they are with their firm on a variety of different questions: compensation and benefits; training and guidance; relations with partners and other associates; interest in and satisfaction level with the work; the firm’s policy on billable hours; and management’s openness about firm strategies and partnership chances. And what came up time and again in respondents’ answers? This year, firm culture is in the crosshairs, and billable hours expectations amid a “minor recession” are to blame. It seems that many top Biglaw firms aren’t “passing the vibe check.”

Some of the law firms that took the biggest dives in associate satisfaction compared to 2022 dealt with financial struggles as the economy turned in the middle of last year. At Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, which fell from 20th place in associate satisfaction last year to 52nd this year, several associates said the vibes around the firm got worse as the deal spigot ran dry.

“The firm culture has changed as the continued ‘financial crisis’ slows work down. Every penny spent is scrutinized,” said one Cadwalader associate. “I understand that it’s about the billable hours, but ‘what happened to everything else you valued during the busy times?’ is a question I ask myself lately.”

Cooley took a dive in the rankings—dropping from 22nd to 55th—and received an earful in open-ended responses from associates who noted the stark change in morale as hours dried up and layoffs began rolling through the firm.

“We preach ‘Be Cooley’ but that only applies when times are good,” said a Cooley associate. “When work slows, partners turn from being these ‘cool, fun’ people into rude, dismissive, cruel people.” Another associate said the firm’s attitude shifted from “we appreciate you” to “you are lucky to be here” after mass layoffs in late 2022. The firm also chafed some associates by strongly encouraging a return to the office—which some associates took as a mandate amid layoffs—after previously allowing remote work.

Another big rea of concern for midlevels was office attendance mandates. Everyone continues to enjoy the flexibility of working from home, but being forced to work from the office really put a damper on midlevel associates’ experience. The call for associates to return to the office has been met with great displeasure — especially because it seems to be all sticks and not enough carrots:

Midlevels are coming to terms with increasing office attendance mandates, although most were adamant that three days per week was plenty of facetime with their coworkers. Rather, associates’ biggest complaints around returning to the office were directed at firms’ lack of effort in making the office worth the commute.

“If you’re going to implement return to office, invest in workplace culture (more than free food),” said one Cooley associate. “We need time outside of billable hours to build teams and do professional development.”

That said, free food was enough of a carrot for a surprising number of associates.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It’s an unplanned expense they were not expecting.

— Owen Burman, a senior consultant at Wells Fargo’s Legal Specialty Group, in comments given to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/cravath-announces-raises-upping-pay-ante-large-law-firms-2023-11-28/) on [Milbank’s surprise salary increases](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/), which have since been raised even higher thanks to [Cravath’s money moves](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/). Burman said that elite firms with high profits will be able to match the compensation bumps, but others may have a difficult time doing so.

# Firm With Big Profits Per Partner Shares The Riches -- In Certain Cities....

Happy Friday, King & Spalding associates, you’re getting a raise! The Biglaw firm has [profits per partner of $2,515,000](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755653273?slreturn=20160517141746) — that’s a lot of cheese that is now being shared with the diligent associates toiling away in office buildings around the country. Well, maybe….

You see, K&S decided not to make a general announcement regarding the increases to associate compensation, but instead sent associates in the New York office individualized letters, inside sealed envelopes, letting them know their new base salary rate — what one of our sources called a “stealth announcement.” The raises are effective July 1 and, by all accounts, are consistent with the Cravath scale (up through eighth-year associates, which is where the Cravath scale stops).

No confirmed word, yet, about the other U.S. K&S offices, which include Atlanta (the mother ship), Austin, Charlotte, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Washington, D.C. If you’re in one of these offices and have raise news to share, please let us know ASAP.

UPDATE (2:54 p.m.): We hear that K&S has matched in D.C.

UPDATE (2:56 p.m.): It appears that summer associates are getting raises in offices where associates are getting raises.

UPDATE (2:58 p.m.): Houston, we do not have a problem — King & Spalding has matched there too.

UPDATE (3:41 p.m.): Austin is also moving to the Cravath scale. Atlanta associates were told they’d be getting a raise, but it would not match the Cravath scale.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Oh Hai Covington!
## It took a long time, but the D.C. market may be joining the $190K club in earnest.

Shares[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/oh-hai-covington/&text=Oh%20Hai%20Covington!)[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/oh-hai-covington/&display=popup&ref=plugin&src=share_button)[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/oh-hai-covington/)[](javascript:void(""#ea-share-count-email""))
Ten days ago, we heard that Covington had matched the recent round of salary increases. After loyal Covington tipsters wrote in suggesting that our sources may have been repeating the same rumor, we pulled back the story to wait for more details. It may have taken some time, but now we can welcome the D.C. firm to the ranks of the matching:


The match applies to all U.S.-based associates and includes the summer bonuses that most of the major firms have announced. As a quick refresher, Covington’s U.S. offices are in Washington, New York, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Los Angeles.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This marks a big moment for the DC market, where the major DC-based players have responded lethargically to the new round of salary increases. Covington, Arnold Porter, Wilmer, and even Williams & Connolly (who already exceeded the market, but hasn’t announced a raise to keep ahead) have all taken their sweet time to [respond to the new normal in associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/by-any-metric-these-firms-really-should-have-raised-associate-compensation-by-now/). Perhaps Covington just broke the ice for the others.

We’ll see over the coming days.

(Memo on the next page…)

If your firm matches (or exceeds!) please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”).

# Women Lawyers 'Speak Up' On RBG’s Birthday

What do RBG’s birthday, The Ms. JD annual conference, and my Dad’s birthday have in common? Well, this year, they all happened on March 15th. If you are unfamiliar with Ms. JD, it is a nonprofit organization that is dedicated to the success and support of women law students as well as aspiring and early career women lawyers. That’s right. There was a women lawyers conference, hosted by a nonprofit whose sole mission is to support women lawyers, on the patron saint of women lawyers’ birthday. What could possibly be better than that?

This year’s conference was held at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and co-hosted by the Penn Law Women’s Association, and the theme was “Speak Up.” The conference featured numerous panels, discussions, keynotes, and breakout sessions. I had the pleasure of being a panelist on the Alternative Career Roadmap panel and of attending several other sessions. Here are a few of the highlights and my takeaways from this fabulous event.

The first workshop, “Finding your voice and using it,” given by Gail J. Cummings, of Gail J. Cummings Consulting, LLC, truly encompassed the conference theme. Gail encouraged us all to speak up for ourselves in our careers and gave concrete tips on how to do so. For example, we should eliminate unnecessary “I’m sorrys” from our vocabulary and know and demand that we be paid our value. My biggest takeaway from this session came in the form of a reminder of something I already knew: true courage is not about being unafraid but being afraid and taking action anyway, despite your fears.

Next up was the first breakout session. Attendees had the option of three panels: Law Firm Life: How to make the most of your billable hour as an advocate for your clients and yourself; The Alternative Career Roadmap: Use your degree in a field that fuels your passion; or The Public Interest Path: Advocating for yourself while working for the common good. I spoke on the Alternative Career Roadmap panel along with Monsurat Adebanjo, Director of Business and Legal Affairs at Brown Girl For The Arts Media, and Cheryl Solomon, Founder of Row House Yarn.

Together, we fielded questions about the trajectory of our careers, why we decided to branch out from the practice of law, how we ensure our financial security, and what practical steps someone should take when opening a business, among many other great questions. I was surprised to learn that several of the attendees were still law students and were considering opening businesses completely unrelated to the legal field. It was inspiring to hear the stories of my fellow panelists and of the aspirations of the the attendees. My biggest takeaway from this panel was that a law degree can serve you well anywhere you take it — including an online knitting company!

I knew the lunchtime Fireside Chat with E.J. Borrack, General Counsel, The Stilwell Group, Jannie Lau, Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary, InterDigital, Inc., and Lisa Matson, General Counsel & Senior Partner, Penn Capital Management was going to be, well, on fire. However, as I don’t practice law, I wasn’t sure it would be relevant to me. Well, I was definitely wrong about that. These women are so badass and have had such interesting and challenging careers that it was impossible not to take away some great information. Some of the topics they spoke about were the balance (or the illusion of balance) in the context of law firms and in-house positions, the importance of women in management positions ensuring pay-equity for other women, and navigating a promotion.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
My biggest takeaway from this panel came from Jannie Lau. She shared a story about hiring a woman to work as a VP under her, and HR asked what she makes in her current position. Jannie told HR that it didn’t matter what the new VP makes now, rather they should base her compensation off of the job that she is being hired to do. Jannie explained that this is an important way to ensure women are being fairly compensated for the work they are doing. Her message clearly not only resonated with me, but the entire audience as well, who immediately broke out into applause.

Additional workshops and panels that I did not have the pleasure of attending covered topics such as personal branding, women working in tech, advice from women working as in-house counsel, women with legal careers in the military, negotiating for career success, and a conversation about what men can and should do to make the legal profession more inclusive with a few male allies.

In between the scheduled events, there were a few “inspiration breaks” where women shared their personal stories and, of course, a few RBG quotes. Overall, it was a wonderful day of women lawyers networking, connecting, and supporting each other. I can’t think of a better way to have celebrate RBG’s birthday. Can you?

Which 2016 Vault Top 30 firm has yet to join the exclusive MoneyLaw club?

Hint: All but one firm on the Vault Top 30 list has announced pay raises this month (excepting Wachtell Lipton, whose enormous bonuses put them at the top of the compensation game, and Williams & Connolly, which already paid first-year associates [$200,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-who-pays-a-starting-salary-of-200000-williams-connolly/).)

You know why we’re here. Another Biglaw firm just issued a salary increase and bonuses to its employees. Drumroll please… it’s Holland and Knight! Here’s the scale:





Congrats on making the big bucks! Why not share the wealth with the [Hillsborough Literacy Council](https://hillsboroughliteracy.org/)? Like Holland and Knight, they are centered in Florida and spend a lot of time having adults sift through material. Pay your blessings forward. Because who knows? A Literacy Council beneficiary (or their children) could one day walk the halls!

We like hearing about raises and bonuses almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

He is a former boatbuilder who cannot swim, [a published author on critical race theory, philosophy, and humor](https://www.academia.edu/33296970/Lets_Be_Frank_Parrhesia_and_the_Black_Comedic_Tradition), and has a love for cycling that occasionally annoys his peers.

An anonymous Illinois bar applicant took to Reddit [to confess to cheating on the exam](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/step-1-cheat-on-the-bar-exam-step-2-announce-on-reddit-that-you-cheated-on-the-bar-exam/). Perhaps “anonymous” should be placed in quotes because the author proceeded to provide a ton of identifying details triggering a bar examiner investigation. Also, new data suggests [lawyers should raise rates](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/lawyers-should-raise-their-rates/), but is that really true? And merger mania is [back in Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/worlds-biggest-law-firm-gobbles-up-indian-firm-gets-even-bigger-in-historic-move/) with two [top-tier mergers](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/top-50-biglaw-firm-to-merge-with-prominent-litigation-boutique/). All that and a brief aside about Liechtenstein admiralty law.

Professional Development teams play an essential role across all types of firms in keeping lawyers informed both professionally and personally. This month, PLI is recognizing its inaugural [PD Appreciation Month](https://bit.ly/38aTnpf), and for this year’s theme, it’s putting the focus on wellness.

“Wellness” is everywhere in the legal community these days — and with good reason. With the uncertainties of the job market, remote work, and schooling, and everyday worry over the pandemic, lawyers and legal professionals may be more stressed than ever. During November, PLI is debuting its [Empowering Professional Development 2020: Well-Being in the Legal Industry](https://bit.ly/3mPEcG8) series. For the first three Thursdays of November, esteemed leaders in professional development and well-being will address these important topics for law school students, attorneys, and professional staff. 

Kirsten Talmage, PLI’s Senior Director for Product Strategy & Development, discussed the program and importance of the PD community. 

Why have a PD Appreciation Month?

PLI has always valued the professional development community; we enjoy a close working relationship with the individuals involved and their consistent feedback has led to the development of new programs, products and other offerings. Over the last three years, we’ve launched the [PD Center](https://bit.ly/2I5EWaY), which houses content created exclusively for the community, including our PD Insider interview series and PD Interactive webinars, as well as resources on creating effective training and instructional design. We thought it was important to continue to build on the PD Center by offering a dedicated, yearly program to this community and to recognize their tremendous efforts in directing attorney training. 

How did PLI select well-being as the focus of the inaugural program?

We have increased our resources and programs about attorney wellness over the last five years. We’ve also noted and want to be responsive to the increase in instances of attorney depression, addiction and suicide, and feel that we, as an organization, can provide proactive resources to the legal community that promote wellness and provide effective methods for living a healthier lifestyle and understanding and coping with stress and depression. 

The PD community is uniquely situated to promote and advocate wellness at all levels within a firm and to provide training and support to their peers. Many firms now have committees and even departments dedicated to well-being for attorneys and professional staff. So, really, it was an easy decision to focus on well-being.

What will the program cover?

We purposefully split the program into separate panels to focus on three different demographics within the community: law students, attorneys, and professional staff within firms. We thought it was critical to address all three areas, as wellness and the impact of wellness within a firm begins in law school, continues through practice, and implicates everyone within the firm. 

[The panel on law schools](https://bit.ly/32a4Z83) will address well-being challenges faced by both students and schools and the role that the profession can play in supporting law students’ well-being efforts. [The panel on attorney well-being](https://bit.ly/3jSe5fS) focuses on best practices to incentivize attorneys and staff to attend well-being programs as well as the most (and least) effective live programs, coaching, apps, and online programs. Finally, [the panel on well-being for professional staff](https://bit.ly/32cqXrf) will help them to find value and fulfillment in the face of declining attorney well-being, and provides tools to manage increased stress caused by always-available technology, attorney mental health or substance abuse challenges, and unrealistic attorney expectations. 

Who is the intended audience? 

The program is intended for anyone in the PD community regardless of experience or title. While we planned the program around the PD audience, all attorneys will certainly benefit from the three panels, and take away a better understanding of why wellness should matter to them, the importance of well-being practices beginning in law school, and the value in having the professional staff also supported in their own wellness journey. We purposefully made the program complimentary for all attendees because we feel that well-being is such a critical topic. 

What other resources does PLI provide that focus on wellness training? 

PLI has a variety of programs that address the area of well-being and attorney mental health, available under “[Attorney wellness and stress reduction](https://bit.ly/3eprw5Q)” on our website. Notably, our December 10 program, [Taking Control of Your Well-Being: Mental Health and Wellness for Attorneys](https://bit.ly/3jUhOK1), tackles the very important topics of overcoming the stigma of mental health and substance use challenges in the legal profession, and shows how to leverage your legal organization’s wellness program and steps to take if your firm doesn’t have one. 

Note: The American Bar Association has a list of [assistance programs by state](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/resources/lap_programs_by_state/) that provide confidential services and support to individuals facing substance use disorders or mental health issues. If you or someone you know are struggling, reach out to an assistance program or call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) for immediate support. 

[](https://bit.ly/34XJclV)Practising Law Institute is a nonprofit learning organization dedicated to keeping attorneys and other professionals at the forefront of knowledge and expertise. PLI is chartered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York and was founded in 1933 by Harold P. Seligson. The organization provides the highest quality, accredited, continuing legal and professional education programs in a variety of formats which are delivered by more than 4,000 volunteer faculty including prominent lawyers, judges, investment bankers, accountants, corporate counsel, and U.S. and international government regulators. PLI publishes a comprehensive library of Treatises, Course Handbooks, Answer Books and Journals also available through the PLI PLUS online platform. The essence of PLI’s mission is its commitment to the pro bono community. View PLI’s upcoming live webcasts [here](https://bit.ly/34XJclV).

2023. What a year! Artificial Intelligence (AI) has upended industries worldwide, and the legal sector is no exception. Whether you are a believer or a skeptic, whether you are an early adopter or a laggard, it is hard to avoid being sucked into the vortex of questions, expectations, and concerns.

The fact is that a shift has happened. Technology is now allowing us to do or at least imagine how we might be able to do things that we couldn’t before.

Whether we are going to go through a few rounds of resetting expectations, we will inevitably see an increased use of AI, both as specific tools and within tools that we use daily. Consequently, this will — sooner or later — shine a light on our enterprise content’s readiness for AI. For many organizations, this is creating a here-and-now desire to get ready for AI. The risk of doing nothing and falling behind is too significant to ignore. Equally, the opportunity to get ahead is too attractive to dismiss with conservative skepticism. 

In parallel, users need answers, guidance, and training, whether jumping in with both feet or just dipping their toes. 

Start by Focusing on Your Cases 

Organizations are now faced with many choices. Wait or go early. Build in-house or buy third party. Give access to everyone or only specialists. Expose all or just small sets of content to AI.

To determine the right approach and have a higher chance of success, firms should start with a clear definition of what they want to do with AI and how it will impact their business. It is, after all, technology, and all technology should be purchased and implemented with specific intent. 

It is certain that Generative AI will not be suitable for all tasks or use cases and in most cases, firms will not let it anywhere near anything with a hint of client-facing advisory work. 

The best way to start is to identify core use cases that deliver value through improved productivity, growth or supporting new business models. Prioritize those that meet as many of the following criteria as possible: 

- There are clear and limited datasets that can be associated with the use case.
- The associated data is low-sensitivity and does not contain PII (personally identifiable information). 
- The use case does not involve many different groups of people, particularly complex cross-organizational processes.
- The use case is conceptually simple and can be modelled through manual steps.
- If implemented successfully the use case will have high visibility and impact.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
People will be at the heart of successful outcomes. The explosive adoption of Generative AI in the mainstream of technology usage has caused many myths, misunderstandings, and false expectations. It has also given rise to a whole new set of AI experts perpetuating said myths, misunderstandings, and false expectations. 

Onboarding AI — particularly Generative AI — as a technical capability within a firm therefore needs a bit more thinking than your average technology roll-out. In some cases, you will need to move some users back to “square one” and reset their thinking, before moving forward as a whole. 

Equally, it is vitally important to address the user community’s desire for using AI tools, sooner rather than later, to avoid the proliferation of shadow AI. 

We recommend starting with a primary and firm-wide internal communication and education initiative, provided alongside a safe and secure, organizationally controlled AI interface where users can experiment with zero risk. 

Educate and allow users to experiment with: 

- Basic prompts to understand a GPT LLM’s limitations. 
- Prompts known to provide incorrect answers. 
- Similar prompts to understand the nature of LLM responses being “non deterministic” (i.e., you might not get the same answer every time). 
- Prompts where the LLM will be leveraging an authoritative source of your data  as part of generating a response. 
As part of the education, provide clear guidance and communication to further people’s understanding of Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, and how/why it can sometimes be prone to answer incorrectly (with great confidence as well!) and how users can avoid exposure to risks caused by, among other things: 

- lack of transparency, 
- accuracy and bias of models, 
- intellectual property (IP) issues, 
- sustainability concerns. 
Like end-users being responsible for the content in their emails, firms are likely to put the onus on end-users to check any work drafted by Generative AI. For this and many other reasons, organizations will need to implement policies and controls to detect the use of data in prompts, biased/inaccurate outputs, and so forth. 

But rolling out AI is also about getting the basics right. It can be met with or create profound cultural resistance — sometimes for good reasons. Unsurprisingly, given the amount of misinformation about AI, it can foster anxiety, nervousness and fear. 

Effective change management and communication strategies are necessary to ensure smooth adoption and overcome user resistance or fear related to implementing any AI use case to end users. 

Depending on the use cases chosen as high priorities, the change programs can — and should — be highly adaptable, and you can learn from each of these before moving on to the next one. 

But when it comes down to real business and for AI to be effective, knowledge management teams — and subject matter experts such as PSLs — are the perfect home for honing AI-related skills and ensuring the truth and validity of the firm’s data is both protected and leveraged in what we refer to as the AI Sweet Spot (more about this below). The KM function has, in effect, never been more important or relevant than it is now. 

We recommend creating a a cross-functional and cross-practice Center of Excellence (CoE) within your firm to build and disseminate the expertise and experience gathered around Generative AI. The CoE can ensure the firm maximizes the potential of AI through centralized governance and strategy, helping to bring together the right people, clarifying the objectives, owning the use cases, executing the implementation, and measuring progress. 

Content-Centric Actions 

As organizations start to experiment with AI interfaces that work with organizational content, outcomes typically fall short of the end-user expectations. This is mainly caused by one thing in particular: Content is not yet ready. 

This lack of data readiness stems from an overall — and often historic — lack of data governance. Data is typically over shared, under tagged, lacking in consistent version control, and abundantly duplicated and outdated, to name some problems. 

Another practical issue is that the content is not available in a system or form that the AI can work with. For instance, Microsoft 365 Copilot will require high-quality data to be available in SharePoint Online so it can be indexed in the Microsoft Graph to be made available via the Semantic Index.

For those that have worked on enterprise search solutions, you will notice some similarities in these challenges and indeed, many of the same hygiene factors that an efficient and trustworthy search solution requires will need to be in place for AI. 

In this context, we talk about an AI Sweet Spot, which is “good content” that can be used for anchoring AI and providing better “grounding” during the prompt process. 

At one end of the scale, content is just a binary object (a file) with a little bit of metadata (such as a filename, date and author) which provides little context outside of the actual document content. 

At the other end of the scale, a file might be tagged with related sectors, legal subject areas, and legal jurisdiction, turning it into content that can be used as knowledge in the proper context. From that, content can now be connected to create expertise. 

This end of the scale, where content exists as knowledge and can be linked together as expertise, is where AI can thrive. This is the AI sweet spot. 



The technology architecture behind this dictates that the more that can be inferred from what we know about content, the better we can identify content relevant to the user’s prompt. The reason is that the user’s prompt is broken down into different “sub prompts,” some of which can simply be thought of sub-searches that are happening behind the scenes. This is why the challenges with AI are very similar to those of enterprise search.

But arguably, when — and if — you consider using Generative AI to draft an overview of relevant specialisms for a proposal, article or summary, for instance, the challenges and consequences go deeper. 

To illustrate this, consider the following prompt (ignoring any system prompt): “For a tender response to Bank of Laska, provide an overview of our relevant specialisms, each with a header and a 100-word description, based on other tender responses to the same or similar clients.” 

An experienced human would obviously conduct a few searches and put the answer together with a high degree of confidence. 

But what will the Gen AI do? First, we must assume it can access “your data” across your platforms. Second, it must be able to infer similar clients from the content or metadata. Third, it will have to search for the most relevant documents from which it will extract content. And so on. 

Just by looking at these three steps, we can quickly identify areas to focus on when getting ready for AI. 

- Consolidate content in a modern content management system, such as Microsoft 365, or connect and streamline content indexing from multiple systems (iManage, Netdocs, etc). 
- Enrich your content with metadata, making it more identifiable and permitting the relationships to be more confidently inferred. 
- Remove redundant and outdated content and *at minimum* adopt proper file level version control rather than named versions. 
This solves a big part of the headache, but interestingly, we are still left with some more esoteric challenges. When looking at the content, faced with 100 examples of previous tender responses, which ones come first? (Don’t say all of them, as this has massive cost implications.) 

This moves us to the next level of content preparation, which might include: 

- Identifying the “right” types and rules for content that is to be made available for Gen AI. 
- Checking for accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability. 
- Cleaning and preparing content repositories, accordingly, including checking permissions. 
Considering that most organizations will hold hundreds of gigabytes of data per employee, it is not surprising that most CIOs, CISOs and CDOs will look at these challenges as a very big mountain to climb. Possibly too big a mountain.

The alternative is to focus on making the higher graded content, the gold standard content, available to AI. The organizations with the most foresight and ambition will implement a modern knowledge platform to better create, maintain and manage (including disposing of) this higher graded content effectively and dynamically. 

Your high-priority use cases will be those that determine if *all content* should be in scope or if you can prepare and make smaller sets of content available for specific use cases and tasks. 

We believe the latter will be the popular choice for most, and indeed, in Atlas, we developed an innovative concept to support this. Called “knowledge collections,” this allows organizations to efficiently manage how their content is made available for specific tasks and use cases. 

How an Intelligent Knowledge Platform Can Accelerate the Journey 

To make AI sing to your tune, a lot of groundwork is needed. 

A Knowledge Platform with capabilities to prepare for, utilize, or deliver on use cases supported by Generative AI can significantly accelerate the journey. Such a platform, also known as an Intelligent Knowledge Platform, should be seen as an orchestration tool for leveraging AI capabilities while delivering on hygiene requirements and advanced features for driving knowledge-centric productivity, collaboration, and communication. 

Atlas – an Intelligent Knowledge Platform – accelerates the journey in several ways, including those in the table below:

Intelligent Knowledge Platform characteristics	How it accelerates the AI journey 	Other benefits
Auto-tagging of content across at least five  categories of tags	Content that is richly tagged and described will provide better quality outcomes in Generative AI, allowing for better anchoring and grounding.	Comprehensive tagging is the foundation for successful search scenarios, including greater usability and contextual search results.
Consistent and scalable content governance controls	Consistency is fundamental for confidence in AI generated outcomes. Therefore, efficient management of content across 1000s of Sites, Libraries, Teams, Channels, etc. is a must.	Reduces the risk of data leakage; increases ability for auto-labelling; improves ability to set “just enough” permissions.
Automated application of security or sensitivity labels	Areas of content or individual content items that have labels can be excluded from various scenarios and views – including Microsoft 365 Copilot usage.	Labels can help automatically exclude content, set ethical walls, and also assist in content lifecycle management by allowing policies for retention, archiving or disposal to be applied.
 

Collaborative knowledge bases for subject matter experts, with ring-fenced management and content grading	Give knowledge managers and subject matter experts full control of the management and grading of their knowledge.	Helps drive a firm wide knowledge agenda by enabling delegated and decentralized knowledge creation and management, underpinned by global governance controls.
Creation of dynamically maintained “knowledge collections”	Enabling authorized knowledge owners to define dynamic collections of knowledge that can be consumed by AI empowers business users to create their own GPT data sets.	Reduces reliance on IT operations and reduces overall cost of creating, running and operating RAG vectorizations at scale.
AI Assistant User Interface 	A safe environment, fully controlled and governed by the firm, for users to work with Generative AI while leveraging organizational data.	Visibility and control of usage costs. Control of access by user or group. Logging of prompts (and optionally responses) plus additional metrics. Custom Terms of Use policies. Elimination of Shadow AI.

Thanks to the Delta variant and vaccine hesitancy, the U.S. remains the country with the highest rate of new COVID cases. Law firms across the country are taking action on this important matter, and have decided to take their employees’ health and safety to heart when instating new office return policies, including recent vaccination mandates.

For reference, the following firms are requiring all employees to be vaccinated before they return to the office: [Akin

Another Biglaw firm that recently made a move on vaccines is Paul Hastings. Last week, the firm not only decided to reinstate its face covering policy in all U.S. offices, but it also rolled out a new vaccine plan for all personnel working in a U.S. office or attending in-person firm events. Effective August 10, all U.S. employees are expected to be fully vaccinated and practice universal masking. Per a memo from co-managing partners Greg Nitzkowski and Ronan O’Sullivan, these measures will “lesson the likelihood of contagion at the office, and reduce the potential for a vaccinated individual to bring the virus home to family members.” Sources we’ve heard from report that they’re “very happy” about the firm’s vaccine mandate.

Will your firm be changing its plans when it comes to vaccination for attorneys and staff thanks to the Delta variant? Please let us know.

(Flip the page to read the memo from Paul Hastings.)

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

“Unprecedented” has become an instant cliche — the most ubiquitous shorthand for the developments of 2020. And even as new vaccines hold the promise of an eventual return to pre-pandemic life, we’re beginning 2021 in an era marked by rapid transformation.

That’s why we’ve launched this project: We want to ensure you’re up to date on the latest issues affecting the profession — be they rulings regarding contract termination rights, developments in government stimulus, or how law firms are planning for office reentry. 

This [page](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/unprecedented/) will include original surveys and research, the latest in CLE offerings, feature articles focusing on varied practice areas, podcasts from our editors, special guest appearances, and much more.

# Got A Lateral War Story? Tell Us About It!
## If you have participated in a lateral group move, we want to hear from you.

When a large number of lawyers leave one firm for another, the effects can be far-reaching. A mass lateral raid [marked the end of Bingham](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/bingham-to-go-bust-in-wake-of-morgan-lewis-raid/) almost a decade ago. More recently, [Stroock was struck](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/the-end-may-be-near-as-stroock-loses-more-than-half-its-partners-to-hogan-lovells/) by a similar fate. On the flip side, a mass exodus from Lewis Brisbois [crashed and burned](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/lewis-brisbois-barber-ranen-daugherty-lordan-closure/). Even if the consequences aren’t quite so dramatic (see e.g., [Top Biglaw Firms Trade Partner Raids In Rainmaker Battle](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/top-biglaw-firms-trade-partner-raids-in-rainmaker-battle/)), the moves are bound to leave an impact.

Above the Law is partnering with a team of researchers at the[ University of Cincinnati Business School](https://business.uc.edu/) who are studying the mass movements of lawyers between law firms.

Toward that end, we are looking for war stories.

If you have either participated in or witnessed firsthand a mass movement of lawyers from one firm to another — whether it was a group of partners who left together to join another firm or a slow drip of departures from one firm to another — we want to hear from you.

How did the event come about and what were its effects? While we’re interested in the underlying facts — who initiated the move, how the group was formed, why they left, and what was the impact — we’re also eager for any juicy details about the move and its aftermath, among the attorneys themselves as well as the two firms involved.

If you have insights into such lateral upheavals, now’s your chance to dish! And rest assured, the[ survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0jJ2PIa2ytUcJM2) is both short and entirely anonymous.

# Biglaw Firm Accused Of Firing Immunocompromised Paralegal Who Asked To Work From Home
## The Am Law 100 firm is being sued under under state, federal, and New York City laws.

As Biglaw firms attempt to get their employees [back into the office at any cost](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/law-firm-reopenings/) in the wake of the pandemic, one Am Law 100 firm now stands accused of firing an immunocompromised staff member in retaliation for his request to work from home after receiving a cancerous diagnosis.

Steven Miller had worked as a litigation paralegal in Pillsbury’s New York office since 2013. In a suit he filed against the firm last week, he claims that despite talks of returning to the office during the coronavirus crisis, Pillsbury had previously allowed him to work from home following his 2021 diagnosis with JAK2, a “cancerous condition” that put him at high risk of contracting COVID-19. At the time, he’d submitted a letter from his doctor that urged him to work remotely, and the firm complied with his doctor’s orders, seeing as everyone else was still working from home.

As noted in the complaint, Miller was fired on February 15, 2022, shortly after he sent HR a January 26 letter from his oncologist requesting that he be allowed to work from home until July 2022 — a time that stood in conflict with the firm’s planned return-to-office date of February 22. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/24/pillsbury-fired-immunocompromised-paralegal-for-work-from-home-request-suit-alleges/) has the details on what Miller alleges happened next (which sounds quite reminiscent of a stealth layoff):

Supervisors had cited poor performance as the reason for Miller’s termination, even though Miller’s most recent performance review had been positive, according to the complaint. Miller claims that Pillsbury discriminated against him “based on his disability and retaliated against him for requesting reasonable accommodations for his disability.”

Miller is suing Pillsbury under state, federal, and city laws, and discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act as well as retaliatory termination can be found among the seven causes of action listed in his complaint.

A Pillsbury spokesperson offered the following statement on Miller’s lawsuit: “These allegations are without merit, and we are confident in our defense. We continue to be recognized by the leading organization for business disability inclusion as one of the best places to work.”
