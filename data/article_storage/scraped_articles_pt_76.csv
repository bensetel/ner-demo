# First Monday Musings By Dean Vik Amar: A Guided Tour Through The Debate Over Changing The ABA Employment Data Form
## It's a complicated mix of arguments about substantive policy, procedural thoroughness, and outside perception.

It is, I think, a sign of the lingeringly tight job and law school applicant markets that over the past few weeks many law deans have been weighing in on a contentious change in the form the American Bar Association (ABA) uses to record and communicate employment outcomes for each law school’s most recently graduated class. As I explain below, the issue involves a complicated mix of arguments about substantive policy, procedural thoroughness, and perceptions by the outside world.

As other commentators, such as Kyle McEntee (for this [website](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/aba-takes-giant-step-backwards-on-transparency/)) and Jerry Organ (on [TaxProf Blog](http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2017/08/without-any-transparency-in-the-process-the-council-for-the-section-of-legal-education-and-admission.html)), have documented in great detail, the ABA Council on Legal Education earlier this summer amended the form to be used to depict employment results, beginning with the Class of 2017. The amendments are supposed to promote simplification, but in addition to containing technical mistakes the new form collapses certain categories that many observers think deserve separate treatment. For example, the new form lumps together all law firms that employ 100-500 lawyers, even though some folks think that a firm of 101 lawyers is qualitatively different than one that has 350 lawyers. Much more controversially, the new form does not – in a way the old form did – display the number of jobs a school’s graduates hold that are funded by the law school itself and that are open only to graduates of that law school, so long as the job lasts a year and pays $40,000. So-called “school-funded” jobs have been a contentious issue for several years, and it is thus unsurprising that when people found out what the Council had done to alter the reporting of such jobs, many folks [sat up and took notice](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/aba-takes-giant-step-backwards-on-transparency/).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Some deans (often from schools that have a significant number of school-funded positions, which causes many to discount their views but that also means these deans know about at least some of these jobs) argue that school-funded jobs that pay a decent wage should not be “discriminated against” by separate treatment on the ABA form. They point out that: (1) many school-funded jobs consist of public interest fellowships; (2) $40K is a representative salary for public interest fellowships generally; (3) the ABA should be encouraging public interest; (4) many if not most of these fellows go on to get decent jobs a year later, and some third-year students pursue a school-funded fellowship even if they could have gotten a (sometimes high-paying) job in the private sector straight out of school; (5) there are other ways consumers can find out about the number and nature of school-funded jobs, at least at some schools; and (6) if the school-funded jobs are treated separately on the form, then U.S. News, for purposes of its rankings, will discount such jobs, which wrongly discourages schools from offering these jobs.

On the other side, many deans argue that: (1) school-funded jobs have been a source of unproductive manipulation by schools in the not-so-distant past and that we should therefore keep an eye on them, which requires gathering and reporting data on them; (2) there is a categorical difference between jobs that are open to all applicants and jobs that are limited to a school’s own graduates, and the world is entitled to know how many of a school’s graduates have jobs that were not open to general competition; (3) not all school-funded jobs involve public interest at all; (4) more generally, school-funded jobs vary by school, and we should not assume that all schools act honorably with respect to them; (5) the ABA should not concern itself with what use U.S. News may or may not make of relevant, nonmisleading data for the public; and (6) it would be a simple enough matter to break school-funded jobs into two separate categories – school-funded jobs reserved for home-grown graduates but that pay $40K, and those that pay less – so that schools could then make the case directly to U.S. News and others that the former subcategory should not be discounted vis a vis jobs funded by the outside world.

I leave it to readers themselves to decide which set of arguments is more persuasive.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In addition to the substantive question of what the form should look like, many, many observers object to the truncated process the ABA Council used to make the changes, ostensibly to clarify the form. I think these process criticisms have merit. There are many ways to clarify the form (see #6 in the second set of deans’ arguments above) that wouldn’t involve melding all $40K school-funded jobs with non-school-funded jobs. Notably, the short memo the Council considered that argued in favor of a new, streamlined form never even discussed whether jobs that are reserved for a school’s own graduates should be collapsed with those that are open to all applicants throughout the country. Also, there was no notice and comment period on the need for or specific proposals for amendment. And so forth.

To be honest, I have not seen or heard any dean really defend the abbreviated and private process that led to these important substantive changes.

Optics:

All of that brings me to a comment voiced by many deans – that it looks terrible to cut back on the finely grained information provided by the form (even if the form needs some clarifying tweaks) at a time when members of public (and regulators in government) remain somewhat skeptical about the way some law schools have conducted themselves in the last two or three years as the job and application markets have shrunk. As just one indicator of the level of public interest, consider that Jerry Organ’s [TaxProf Blog piece](http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2017/08/without-any-transparency-in-the-process-the-council-for-the-section-of-legal-education-and-admission.html) mentioned above – which is sharply critical of the substance and procedure behind the Council’s revisions of the form – garnered over 6,000 “shares” in just three or four days after it was posted. Given that there are fewer than 500 law deans/career service department heads who work directly on this seemingly technical, inside-baseball, kind of issue (and paying due respect to the TaxProf Blog, which I consult myself not infrequently), that’s a lot of eyeballs. Practicing lawyers, judges, prospective law school applicants, government officials, and others are still watching law schools very carefully, and we should be mindful of that. (I might point out that a similarly interesting blend of substantive, procedural, and optical arguments characterizes the debates raging in California [over whether its “cut-score”](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/first-monday-musings-by-dean-vik-amar-tightening-bar-pass-standards-and-the-california-problem/) — the passing threshold for its bar exam — should be lowered.)

To the extent that these matters are heavily influenced by job and admissions markets, let me highlight two positive developments over the summer: (1) Given smaller entering and graduating class sizes in recent years, the Class of 2016 had a higher percentage employed in full-time, long-term, law jobs than did the Class of 2015, and projections for the Class of 2017 are that this metric will improve a bit more; and (2) the number of LSAT takers in June 2017 was up about 20 percent from June 2016, with the registration for the September 2017 test administration also apparently up double digits from last year.

A typical day for a midlevel employee benefits and executive compensation attorney varies dramatically depending on the firm itself and the focus of the practice group. For example, employee benefits and executive compensation teams at many large law firms focus almost exclusively on supporting the corporate department on mergers and acquisitions and other transactions. However, other law firms may offer different opportunities, depending on their client base.

An associate in a large law firm may represent large single-employer, multi-employer and collectively bargained pension plan clients, including pension, profit-sharing, annuity, 401(k), employee stock ownership and other types of employee benefit plans. Representing these plans involves daily calls and e-mails with clients troubleshooting legal issues, as well as assisting clients with:

- Advising on plan asset rules under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) relating to the investment of retirement plan assets in private equity funds and hedge funds, negotiating side letters, and reviewing limited partnership and other operating agreements.
- Correcting plan qualification defects through the Department of Labor (DOL) Employee Plans Compliance Resolution Service.
- Drafting and reviewing participant communications to comply with ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code (Code).
- Drafting plan documents and summary plan descriptions to comply with ERISA and the Code.
- Negotiating service provider, investment management and consulting agreements.
- Advising on participant claims relating to plan investment losses or restrictions on coverage.
In addition to representing employee benefit plan clients, associates may assist partners representing companies and executives in the negotiation and implementation of employment agreements, including provisions dealing with post-employment restrictions.

- Who do you work with?
Because there are many different types of professionals who advise employee benefit plans in some capacity, associates may work directly with plan administrators, human resource professionals, plan actuaries and accountants and, in the context of multi-employer collectively bargained plans, plan trustees and labor union co-counsel.

Typically associates work primarily with partners on larger client matters. However, one unique aspect of this practice area is the opportunity to interact directly with clients as a relatively junior associate. Midlevel associates routinely handle calls as the first line of communication from plan administrators, human resource professionals, actuaries and other entities involved in retirement plan administration, in consultation with the responsible partner. They may also attend trustee meetings for multi-employer, collectively bargained plan clients.

With regard to executive compensation, associates typically work with a partner to negotiate the relevant employment agreements, participating in calls with opposing counsel to finalize the agreement. They may also attend meetings for compensation committees in connection with required executive compensation rules and disclosures. These committees are typically composed of senior executives in public companies.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Many employee benefits and executive compensation attorneys must decide at some point how to focus their career within this practice area. For example, some associates exclusively practice executive compensation and focus on transactional matters, others focus on Title I of ERISA, and still others focus on employee benefit plan compliance matters. It is possible at some large firms to create a career path that includes all of these specialties, but it is more common to become an expert in one or two of these categories.

An employee benefits and executive compensation associate can climb the traditional ladder at a law firm, becoming a midlevel and then senior associate with more significant responsibilities and aspiring to become senior counsel or partner. Alternatively, associates may also choose to develop their experience at a large law firm, and use that experience to leverage a career in-house as an employee benefits counsel to a company or pension fund. Others choose less traditional paths and become either attorney editors who write about this area of law or consultants at an employee benefits consulting firm, such as Mercer.

- If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?
Although this practice area is relatively small, there is an enormous variety in the type of work associates do, depending on the firm’s clients and the individual’s expertise and seniority. An associate may be working on a transaction (or several transactions) while simultaneously handling calls relating to employee benefit plan compliance issues, drafting participant communications or negotiating service provider agreements for retirement plans. Associates who also practice executive compensation may also be negotiating several employment agreements or drafting equity plans.

- How much wear and tear?
Employee benefits and executive compensation has the reputation of being a slower-paced, more manageable practice area than litigation or corporate, for example. That does not always hold true, however, particularly for transaction-based practices. If you are talented, qualified and easy to get along with, the pace of work will be demanding regardless of what practice area you choose.

- Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?
Employee benefits and executive compensation is not necessarily considered one of the sexiest, most exciting practice areas. In transactional work, it is rare for an employee benefits issue to drive the transaction (although, in some cases, large underfunded retirement plans or high-profile executive compensation negotiations may become significant issues). In a non-transactional practice, some associates may feel as though the work is tedious because it is a technical area of law with complex regulations that can be difficult to navigate.

- Of the people in this group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?
The people working in this practice area are known for being friendly, and the world of practitioners is small and tight-knit. Associates get to know a wide variety of attorneys from different firms, and there are opportunities to get involved with professional organizations and participate in speaking engagements from an early stage in your career. Attorneys in this area also love being able to develop a long-term relationship with their clients from a relatively junior point in their career.

From a substantive perspective, this practice area may be appealing to those who love to analyze complicated tax regulations and how they fit together, or who prefer negotiating contracts and counseling clients rather than heading to the courtroom to litigate.

- Are there common avenues out of this practice area?
Yes; it is common for employee benefits and executive compensation associates to go to corporate counsel positions for law firm clients, for example. Typically, however, these positions are specifically for employee benefits or executive compensation counsel. Some attorneys also choose to move to the government sector and work for a related agency, such as the DOL or Internal Revenue Service.

- What are some market trends that impact this practice area?
Economic trends affecting the stock market impact work in this area because associates are dealing with either the rules governing the prudent investment of plan assets or an executive’s compensation package. As a transactional attorney, the typical ebb and flow of mergers and acquisitions will affect the number of transactions that associates are working on at any given time.

Political trends also impact this area as it is heavily regulated by administrative agencies. The current environment is a great example in that the Trump administration is working to reverse course on several laws and regulations that were enacted during the Obama administration, such as the Affordable Care Act, the fiduciary investment advice regulation, and the Dodd-Frank Act.

- If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?
In one sentence: someone who likes the challenge of coming up with creative solutions to complicated client issues, is familiar with the workings of the Internal Revenue Code and tax regulations, and does not have an ego about being in the spotlight.

# Biglaw Firm Changes Course On Mandatory Arbitration... For A Limited Time
## Employees will have the option not to arbitrate at this firm.

Biglaw firms that employ mandatory arbitration agreements as a condition of employment are having a PR problem. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, a ton of attention is being paid to firms that still employ the agreements. Harvard Law student activists, organized as the [Pipeline Parity Project](http://www.pipelineparityproject.org/about/), have made it their mission to take down firms that require employees to arbitrate employment issues. Additionally, other [student organizations at elite law schools](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/t14-law-school-groups-taking-a-stand-against-biglaw-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/) have called out forced arbitration as “a process which advantages sophisticated, repeat players at the expense of individual claimants.”

And all the sturm und drang about the practice has translated into real change. After Munger Tolles was [called out on social media for the practice ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-firm-tries-to-force-summer-associates-to-arbitrate-sexual-harassment-claims/)and changed their policy, other firms [voluntarily did away](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/this-biglaw-firm-is-the-first-to-step-forward-and-do-away-with-mandatory-arbitration-for-all-employees/) with the [practice](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/another-biglaw-firm-kicks-mandatory-arbitration-to-the-curb/). Others [required some good, old-fashioned pressure](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/law-school-students-stand-up-to-biglaw-firm-win/), but eventually eliminated the agreements. While there have been some [notable holdouts](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/law-school-students-are-taking-to-the-street-over-biglaw-firms-with-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/), the tide might [finally be turning](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/another-biglaw-firm-kicks-mandatory-arbitration-to-the-curb/) against mandatory arbitration agreements.

Yesterday, Paul Hastings announced a change to their arbitration policy. While the firm still firmly believes in employment arbitration, they are allowing employees to opt out. (Though as they note, they do not have a confidentiality clause as part of their arbitration agreement.) New employees will have the option to opt out when they join the firm, and existing employees have until June 21 to opt out of mandatory arbitration.

Now, an opt-out process is far from perfect. A busy attorney can easily forget to fill out the paperwork, and find themselves bound to arbitration. A better process would be to have all employees affirmatively choose between the options. Then employees who arbitrate would have actually decided to do so, and not just let trial prep get the better of them.

Still, it is better than Paul Hastings’s previous position on arbitration.

Read the email from Paul Hastings about the arbitration policy below.

# Brace Yourself For More Compensation News!
## At least one former partner's aching for this kind of money right about now.

Remember when Bracewell was “Bracewell & Giuliani”? That legal dream team [aged pretty poorly](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/rudy-giuliani-defames-plaintiffs-on-the-courthouse-steps-on-the-first-day-of-defamation-trial/), huh? Bracewell managed to escape its association with the leaky lawyer to establish itself at No. 121 on the Am Law 200 with $303M in gross revenue last year. Now we’re told it’s going to match Cravath salaries effective January 1.

As a reminder, this is what matching Cravath looks like.

Class	Bonus
Class of 2023	$225K
Class of 2022	$235K
Class of 2021	$260K
Class of 2020	$310K
Class of 2019	$365K
Class of 2018	$390K
Class of 2017	$420K
Class of 2016+	$435K

As of now, the firm hasn’t moved on the bonus issue yet, though we have no reason to believe they won’t be matching eventually. I mean… salary is the heavy lift, right?

So we’ll update when we hear about bonuses.

Please help us help you when it comes to salary news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Salary) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Salary”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Getting It Right When We Get It Wrong
## Lawyers hate admitting mistakes, and the profession is worse for it.

Anybody that’s built a billion-dollar company from the ground up has probably had a couple of good ideas about the business world over the course of their career. Jeff Bezos has had more than that. Bezos is the founder and CEO of Amazon, arguably the billion-dollar company in the world today. From the smart speaker in your home to the omnipresent delivery drivers on the streets to the drones that may soon be patrolling the skies, Amazon is as successful as companies come.

So it intrigued me reading a [profile](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/this-is-number-1-sign-of-high-intelligence-according-to-jeff-bezos.html) of Bezos the other day promising to reveal the quality that he values most in his potential employees and colleagues. Most hiring committees will tell you they look for candidates with a proven track record of success. Bezos, on the other hand, is on the hunt for people who will admit to how often they’ve screwed up.

Before you start freshening up your résumé to send off to Bellevue, understand that Bezos isn’t looking for people who simply make errors. Rather, he’s looking for people who are capable of recognizing quickly and accurately, even at cost to themselves, when they’ve gotten something wrong, and who are willing to course-correct based on new, better ideas or data.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Striking A Balance

In the psychology and business studies fields, this sort of capacity is usually referred to as “intellectual humility.” Intellectual humility is the ability to commit to making informed, tough decisions, but to then remain open to changing course based on new information, new ideas, better reasoning, or unexpected feedback. It’s the ability to choose to go a hundred miles per hour, and then stop on a dime and head a different direction when emerging circumstances demand it. It’s the ability to make a reasoned change of opinion, even when that means recognizing failures on one’s own part.

It’s important to distinguish intellectual humility from self-deprecation or a lack of confidence. Intellectual humility actually requires a hell of a lot self-confidence. It requires someone to know that they’re smart and capable, to trust their own decision-making skills and ability to lead, and to get others to buy into the decisions they’ve made. It’s tough to do all of that without falling into straight-out arrogance, but the intellectually humble person has to be comfortable reexamining their prior decisions, and be open to the possibility they’ve made mistakes, or made a choice that is no longer the best one. It’s a hard balance to strike, which is why those who pull it off have Jeff Bezos’ attention.

You Are What You Do

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Answer me honestly: is Biglaw any good at cultivating or rewarding intellectual humility? I hate to say it, but I think the answer is no. I’m sure any reader of this blog has a wealth of anecdotal evidence at their disposal of intractable, arrogant lawyers committing to an idea and refusing to move off of it until far, far too late. I’m sure most lawyers’ spouses would also agree. “Humble” is not a word that gets bandied about much in the corridors of Am Law firms, unless we’re talking about how we humbled the other side of a case or a deal. Something about the private practice of law seems to discourage the development of intellectual humility.

The reasons for this disconnect are likely many, but the one that jumps out at me initially is that law is not structurally conducive to an intellectually humble mindset. Intellectual humility is based on the fundamental principle that the decisions in one’s past may have been good, or may have been sub-optimal or poor, and only by continually analyzing those decisions in light of new data will we understand how we ultimately did. An intellectually humble person is willing to jettison all the arguments that they thought were right if they’re presented new, better evidence or arguments.

Finding The Means To Justify The Ends

This is just about the opposite of a private practice lawyer’s work flow. Being a practicing lawyer means steeping oneself in the techniques of motivated reasoning — identifying the conclusion one wants to reach and then searching for arguments to justify reaching that conclusion. Preparing for a legal fight? A lawyer will start with the premise that their client’s position is the valid one, then go back to try to fill in the gaps to explain why.

Lawyers spend every day racking their brains searching for arguments to justify their clients’ desired endpoints. Those are the mental muscles we choose to exercise, and so we can’t be surprised when those techniques seep into our everyday thought patterns. When we spend all day trying to retroactively justify others’ business decisions, we train our minds to instinctively justify our own business decisions, even when those decisions were bad. We spend so much time convincing others that our analysis is correct in certain circumstances that we end up convincing ourselves that we’re never, ever wrong.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
At its worst, the lawyerly brain fools its owner into deploying seemingly reasonable arguments in defense of our knee-jerk, emotional decisions. Running a law practice is hard, especially in large firms. Any decision that gets made likely had opposition, and people who got entrenched in their opposing arguments and that want to see themselves vindicated in the end.

An intellectually humble attorney might look back on the decisions they had a hand in developing and ask questions about whether goals were met, whether unexpected outcomes cropped up, and whether the other approaches that weren’t taken might have been better at solving the problems the firm sought to address. An intellectually humble attorney must be willing to admit if they were wrong and accept that they may have to reverse course. An intellectually humble attorney will eat crow in front of an entire firm and ask that the project they’ve worked on for months be scrapped or entirely reconfigured beyond recognition.

How many attorneys do you know that would do that? How comfortable would you feel doing that, if you had to? How would a senior associate feel about their prospects of partnership a year removed from standing up in front of the firm and admitting they advocated for what turned out to be a bad idea? How many partners in your firm would feel safe in their jobs admitting “my bad” to their coworkers?

Biglaw would do itself a favor if it came to grips with [the existence and inevitability of failure](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/the-reverse-golden-rule/). Like the poet said, [be humble.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvTRZJ-4EyI) We’re going to screw up, and we’ll be better business people, and frankly just better people, if we can learn to admit it.

The New York Times: Dealbook had a brilliant article yesterday, written by Noam Scheiber, called [“An Expensive Law Degree, and No Place to Use It.”](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/business/dealbook/an-expensive-law-degree-and-no-place-to-use-it.html?_r=1) Don’t let the 2009-era headline fool you, this thing is actually a case study of one, totally screwed, lower tier law school. It’s jammed packed with personal anecdotes that put a human face on the tragedy of bad law schools.

I encourage you to [read the whole thing](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/business/dealbook/an-expensive-law-degree-and-no-place-to-use-it.html?_r=1). The school is Valparaiso and… Jesus, the confluence of bad decisions is just amazing. Look at the first student profiled, a 39-year-old former cop who is trying to start a criminal defense practice:

By most measures, John Acosta is a law school success story. He graduated from Valparaiso University Law School — a well-established regional school here in northwestern Indiana — in the top third of his class this past December, a semester ahead of schedule. He passed the bar exam on his first try in February…

Yet in financial terms, there is almost no way for Mr. Acosta to climb out of the crater he dug for himself in law school, when he borrowed over $200,000. The government will eventually forgive the loan — in 25 years — if he’s unable to repay it, as is likely on his small-town lawyer’s salary. But the Internal Revenue Service will treat the forgiven amount as income, leaving him what could easily be a $70,000 tax bill on the eve of retirement, and possibly much higher.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Just marvel at the things that are wrong in those two paragraphs:

* You don’t borrow $200,000 to go to Valparaiso Law. If somebody gave you $200,000 and you spent it on Valpo Law, you should be kicked in the nuts, daily.
* You don’t borrow $200,000 to go to ANY law school, if your goal is to hang out a shingle as a criminal defense attorney.
* You are not a “success story” if you can only crack the top third at freaking Valpo. Going to Valpo and finishing out of the top five percent means you failed.

John Acosta had a good job and not $200,000 of debt, and he traded it for a Valparaiso Law Degree and the magic beans of hope.

And Acosta isn’t in the worst shape. The article closes by profiling a woman who graduates in 2015 and now works at Meijer (Meijer is like K-Mart and Gristedes had a baby that grew up homeless in Flint) having failed the bar twice. Staring into the abyss, this light of humanity closes with:

“I wouldn’t trade my law degree for anything,” she added. “I would trade the debt.”

That’s like saying “I wouldn’t trade all of my unprotected sex for anything… the AIDS though, I’d get rid of that.”

Kyle McEntee and Paul Campos pop up throughout their article. They’re there to try to keep the focus on the larger racket that the school is running, instead of the individual marks the school has duped.

When the article does turn to the school, it lightly exposes how the administration has taken advantage of these people. One of the most damning sections addresses how the admissions committee decided to deal with the drop in student applications at the turn of the decade.

The [admissions] committee agonized over whether it should accept fewer students or keep its class size roughly constant and admit weaker candidates. In the end, it opted for the latter, a decision [Bruce Berner, retired Valparaiso associate dean] admits wasn’t entirely on the merits, since fewer students would have meant less revenue.

“There was a lot of pressure, of course, from the central administration to keep the numbers up,” he said. (Mark A. Heckler, the university president, said that admissions decisions were entirely up to the law school but that the financial model was for the school to fund itself.)

By 2014, the limitations of the strategy had become apparent: The figures the school reported for the rate at which its graduates passed the Indiana bar exam, which had already been dipping, crashed to about 61 percent, from about 77 percent the year before. An enormous number of students wouldn’t be able to work as lawyers in the state even if jobs were theoretically available.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
This is a significant passage. It’s almost impossible to get law school people to admit to what they actually did. Here, we have a guy who was in the room saying the OBVIOUS truth, law schools made a conscious decision to admit less qualified applicants in order to keep the money coming in.

We know this to be true because the choice for a law school like Valparaiso is so obvious that the Times even came out and said it:

[S]chools like Valparaiso essentially face the following choice: Admit a large number of marginal students, or shut down.

Y-e-p.

Again, you should read the whole thing. There are so many good nuggets. There’s a group of like five gunners that the faculty call “The Legion of Boom,” which really could have been an entire post on its own. There’s the professor who encourages his students to work at “We Buy Liens.” There’s the student who wonders what’s the point of passing the bar when you’re going to end up “working at Starbucks for less than $40,000 per year.”

If this article wasn’t published in the New York Times, it would have been called “When The Toilet Is Clogged: All Of The Lives That Can Be Ruined By Law School.”

# Yet Another Am Law 100 Firm Defers Incoming Associates To January 2024
## This is unwelcome news for those who expected to start working at the firm this fall.

Biglaw [deferrals](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/deferrals/) continue to be announced, offering incoming associates some months-long involuntary vacations, extra stress before the bar exam, and a dearth of expected income, right when student loan payments are expected to come due again.

Sources tell us that Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft — a firm that brought in $544,832,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it in 84th place in the most recent Am Law 100 — has deferred its incoming associates’ start date to January 2024. We’ve been told that the firm is offering a $15,000 stipend to those affected.

Fresh off a 10 percentage point decline in revenue, CWT’s deferral comes in the wake of job cuts made back in April, which presented as a mixture of both [stealth and outright layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/cadwalader-layoffs-2023/). We believe that Cadwalader is now the seventh firm (that we know of) to defer its incoming associates’ start date to the new year.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We reached out to CWT for comment, but the firm did not immediately respond.

Best of luck to Cadwalader’s would-be first-year associates.

# What Have We Learned From Biglaw Bonus Season So Far?
## Making sense of the first two weeks of bonus season.

When Cravath broke its bonuses early this year — at least early based on the last few years — firms across the legal landscape scurried to react to the latest salvo from the once and future compensation lodestar. Is it problematic that industry-wide compensation is set by a tacit agreement to issue carbon-copy compensation based on one player? YEP! But welcome to the legal profession.

While we don’t have a particularly large sample size of matching firms yet, we can still take a step back at this point and divine a few clues about the legal industry based on what we’ve seen so far.

Where is everybody?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Last year, by our count, 26 firms announced bonuses within five days of Cravath’s announcement. This year, even forgiving a Thanksgiving holiday in the middle, we’re not approaching that two weeks in. So what’s going on? Are firms gun-shy after a round of summer salary increases and bonuses? Have we finally hit the breakpoint — long whispered about — where the Am Law 50 is going to break away from the Am Law 51-200, with the latter simply unable to match what the top tier is paying? Has Thanos obliterated the leadership of mid-tier Biglaw?

Perhaps this speculation is still premature. It could also be that the rest of the legal world was simply caught off guard by Cravath’s sudden announcement. Global firms with multiple stakeholders may have already scheduled their bonus meeting for late this week, never expecting Cravath to jump the gun and return to the earlier date that used to prevail.

Still, as days pass, associates get more and more concerned. Even at shops that will ultimately match, what confidence do young lawyers have if the firm is timid enough to pause when confronted with a direct match of 2017’s numbers — plus whatever was given over the summer, of course.

It pays big to go small

While the Biglaw firms just outside the very top tier may have some financial jitters, the elite boutique world continues to pay off as well or better than Biglaw. From [Kaplan Hecker & Fink](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/the-first-firm-to-blow-cravath-bonuses-out-of-the-water/) to [Wilkinson Walsh + Eskovitz](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/litigation-powerhouse-blows-biglaw-bonuses-out-of-the-water/), boutiques are continuing to deliver top-notch bonuses, exceeding what the bigger firms are generally paying.

And that’s not really a surprise. These firms recruit the most sought-after young legal talent to tackle complex matters efficiently.

But there’s a lesson here for Biglaw: if large firms want top talent, they should consider thinking outside the box. And, no, just offering premiums for high billers isn’t the point. Rewarding those who put in more hours fulfills the compensatory role of a bonus, but doesn’t necessarily address the talent retention role. The best lawyers sometimes have slow years — in fact, anecdotally, they often do as their time gets monopolized by a handful of partners keeping the talent from getting spread thin — so just bumping up pay for high hours isn’t really useful.

Whatever the solution, bonus season is proving once again that Biglaw is stuck in a rut and it needs to find a way out.

‘Holiday Bonuses’ are actually about the holidays again

There are still firms out there committed to pushing their bonus distribution date into 2019, but so far the movers are mostly handing out bonuses in time for the holidays.

It was always a bush league move to hand out bonuses deep into the following year — a transparent ploy to disrupt the plans of associates aiming to depart the firm after receiving their bonus. If a firm’s associates are handcuffed to the firm for another three months, they miss out on the opportunities pursued by everyone else.

But these days, the lateral market is a year-round endeavor and firms are even offering to cover the difference on bonuses for talented lawyers to jump ship early. The value of jerking around an associate just isn’t as pronounced as it was 10 years ago. So far, it seems as though firms have recognized that.

The market is playing it safe

After paying out higher salaries and summer bonuses, the market has opted for stability with the same bonus schedule as last year. Not that anyone’s complaining, especially armed with those summer bonuses, but one can’t help but wonder if the market — even at the top — is a little worried about over-extending themselves right now.

Demand growth is still modest and the economy continues to send off jittery vibes. If you understand the summer flurry as primarily a cost of living adjustment, then Biglaw has really delivered a reasonably cautious year when it comes to compensation. What will 2019 bring?

Probably a lot more of the same.

# How Law360 Pulse Tracks Diversity In The Legal Industry
## Data projects leader Kerry Benn discusses law firm diversity data and upcoming offerings from Law360 Pulse.

When it comes to gender and racial diversity, the legal industry still has a way to go. 

Kerry Benn, the director of Series, Surveys, and Data at Law360, dropped by the Evolve the Law podcast to discuss the legal news outlet’s latest Diversity Snapshot and Glass Ceiling Report. The reports examine the state of racial diversity at law firms, as well as how women are faring. While the results aren’t exactly heartening, Kerry offers some ideas for firms looking to make greater progress on diversity and inclusion.

Kerry also dives into some of the new data visualization tools from Law360, including a law firm merger tracker. The tool is one of just many exciting developments to come from Law360 Pulse, which uses powerful data and analytics to deliver exceptional business of law coverage. Readers can check out Law360 Pulse’s insights at Law360.com/pulse.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

ETL: Tell us a little bit about the Diversity Snapshot Report.

We essentially ask firms for the demographics of the attorneys who work there. I’m sure you won’t be surprised to hear that the numbers on the Diversity Snapshot are pretty bad, right? 

It’s something that firms are focusing on a lot, but it’s definitely got a long way to go. We created a set of benchmarks and measured firms on how they did against those benchmarks. 

We look at what percentage of law school graduates are people of color, as that would provide the potential pipeline of hiring for firms. If they’re meeting that number or exceeding it, great. If they’re falling behind, that shows someplace where they can improve. 

We’ve also measured equity partners against the percentage of associates who were people of color. So, where is it falling off? Is it at the hiring level? Is it people leaving before they could become a partner? Is it people just getting passed over for promotions? 

We felt like that hopefully helps firms and gives them a more complete picture of the process.

ETL: What are the big takeaways for law firms that might be interested in this report and trying to do better on diversity and inclusion?

I know since the murder of George Floyd, which was last May, this is something that firms have really tried to step up their commitment to. We’re hoping we’ll see that play out. 

For example, I think we’ve seen like a one percentage point uptick in the number of people of color at firms over the past five or six years. It’s really just barely moving. 

And I think based on our reporting, a lot of what we’ve seen is that there’s a couple of factors at play. One is this institutional bias that comes with the policies that a firm has in place. 

For example, one thing people mentioned often is the assignment of work, and the way origination credits work at firms. That benefits the people who are already in power — the majority of whom are white men. There hasn’t been a lot of movement to change that yet, but I think firms are starting to look at that and say, “Oh, wait, if this is keeping the status quo, maybe it’s time for a shake up on that front.”

ETL: Hopefully this can give some ideas to law firms on how to try to create more diversity and inclusion in our industry.

A couple other things I would say, too, is often we hear from people we interview that people of color don’t feel like they have mentors who look like them at firms. 

I think it’s like 7% of equity partners at firms are people of color. So, you don’t see mentors who look like you, if you’re in that position. 

Also, there’s a huge institutional issue here, where a lot of students of color have difficulty even achieving the goal of getting to law school. It’s something that’s out of reach for many people. 

But then we see a lot of firms, especially big firms, who say, “We’re going to only look for the top 14 law schools in our hiring.” And if they’re not including any of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities in that group, and you’re basically looking at Harvard and Yale — maybe that’s part of the problem, too. Expanding that hiring focus could be an important step.

ETL: Tell us about the Glass Ceiling Report.

It’s based on a survey that we send out to all the biggest firms. We’re looking to see their percentage of women in any level, but especially at higher levels. 

Unfortunately, it is also pretty bad. 

It’s better than the Diversity Snapshot, in terms of raw percentages, but it’s still improving at the same pretty slow rate. 

This year’s report shows that about 38% of attorneys — and less than a quarter of equity partners at firms — are women, which is pretty similar to last year. And of course, women of color face additional challenges, including being overlooked for good assignments and lacking mentorship opportunities. 

At U.S. law schools, women of color make up 20% of first year students, but at the firms we surveyed, women of color only represent 9% of attorneys and 3% of equity partners. That’s a pretty big drop-off.

ETL: Law360 continues to put out a suite of data visualization tools. Tell our audience about some of these tools.

We’ve really been making a huge effort to step up our visualizations and build some new tools. 

In some cases, like on our satisfaction survey, we built an interactive graphic where you could sort by women and men, or by firm size. You can tailor it to your own experience, and say, “Oh, other women in their thirties are more satisfied or less satisfied than I am. What can I do about that for myself?” 

We’re also working on building a law firm merger tracker. And we’ve got a tracker on our website that we’re updating a few times a week about how firms are going back to the office.

ETL: Is there anything else that you’d like to share?

We’re going to launch our partner compensation report to potential respondents, and I’ll be interested to see how that shakes out. 

We’re doing a lot of research and data collection on what makes a great law firm. And we’re planning this big, new law firm ranking that we’re going to release in early 2022 that will look at a bunch of different attributes of firms and try to evaluate who’s the cream of the crop.

# Biglaw Firm To Eliminate Salary Cuts And Award Lump Sum True-Up Payment On New Year's Eve
## Happy new year, associates!

With holiday season upon us, it looks like Biglaw firms are doing more to spread good cheer than just announce bonuses. Some firms have decided to do away with their COVID-19 austerity measures.

Yesterday, Kelley, Drye & Warren — a firm that placed 135th in the latest Am Law 200 rankings, with $232,400,000 in gross revenue in 2019 — announced that the salary reductions it made earlier this year will be completely eliminated on the first day of the new year. Here’s an excerpt from a memo that [James Carr](https://www.kelleydrye.com/Our-People/James-S-Carr), the firm’s chairman, sent to everyone on Thursday:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We are now in a position to restore salaries to pre-COVID levels and will eliminate the remaining COVID salary reductions effective January 1, 2021, for stipulated payment partners, special counsel and associates, and impacted administrative staff. Salary withheld from May 1 through December 31, 2020 will be repaid in a lump sum on December 31. Equity partner draws will return to pre-COVID levels beginning in January. This decision reflects our optimism for the continued financial health of Kelley Drye as well as our sincere gratitude to everyone who worked so hard to make this possible.

If you recall, the firm [cut salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-200-firm-cuts-salaries-firmwide-defers-first-year-associate-start-dates/) by 10 percent across the board for all lawyers and employees earning over $100,000, and slashed equity partners’ draws on a a proportional basis by as much as 20 percent. In September Carr announced that those [reductions would be halved](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-firm-dials-back-austerity-measures-for-everyone-except-partners/) for everyone except partners. As if the end of the cuts wasn’t exciting enough, we imagine that everyone at Kelley Drye must be thrilled they’ll be receiving big checks with their withheld salaries as a New Year’s Eve gift.

Let’s hope more firms are able to roll back COVID-19 austerity measures before the end of 2020. That would help everyone have a really happy new year.

# The 100 Pointer Law Firms: PPP Growth Outperformers Over The Past Decade
## Don't Be a Laggard: See How Your Firm Compares to Davis Polk.

If you’re a high-performing associate with aspirations to make partner, you have many choices in the current booming lateral market. If and when you do ascend to the partnership, you would certainly rather do so at a firm with a strong profitability growth trajectory. Law firm success tends to beget success, and if you’re going to work as hard as Biglaw requires, you might as well do so at a firm that is firing on all cylinders.

To help provide a quantitative indicator of firms’ relative momentum, Lateral Link analyzed growth in profits per partner (PPP) over the decade from 2011-2020, drawing on data published in the Am Law 200. This exercise is instructive both for identifying firms that have outperformed in profitability growth and also for identifying firms that might have been expected to outperform, but didn’t.

The outperformers

Let’s start with the positives. Sixteen firms in our data set more than doubled their PPP over the decade from 2011 to 2020. We’re designating these firms “100 Pointers” — their profitability trajectories have been the envy of the industry.

Firm	PPP multiple (2020 vs 2011)	PPP in 2020 ($m)
Davis Polk	2.76x	6.35
Fenwick & West	2.46x	2.85
Cooley	2.33x	3.18
Nixon Peabody	2.31x	1.63
Choate Hall & Stewart	2.31x	3.24
Fried, Frank	2.29x	3.62
Nelson Mullins	2.21x	1.32
Ropes & Gray	2.20x	3.37
Debevoise & Plimpton	2.19x	4.55
Vinson & Elkins	2.17x	2.94
Kilpatrick Townsend	2.15x	1.36
Fragomen	2.06x	3.23
Polsinelli	2.05x	1.11
Robins Kaplan	2.05x	1.59
White & Case	2.05x	3.02
Kirkland & Ellis	2.03x	6.19
Some of these 100 Pointers will come as no surprise. For example, the outperformance in recent years of the Davis Polk and Kirkland — the only two firms on the list with PPP over $6 million — has been well documented. But even among those two we find an interesting nuance: although Kirkland had materially higher PPP than Davis Polk in 2011 ($3.05m vs. $2.3m), Davis Polk’s remarkable outperformance — close to tripling PPP over the decade — saw it overtake Kirkland by 2020. (David Polk also outperformed Kirkland in Revenue per Lawyer growth during this period: 1.52x vs. 1.46x.)

The strong performances of Fenwick and Cooley also make sense, in the context of a market that has offered rich targets for firms that focus on technology clients. On the other hand, fewer readers might have expected Nixon Peabody to have outperformed so impressively. It is interesting to see that despite the general market narrative of the richest Biglaw firms getting richer, it’s not just the highest PPP firms that have made strong relative gains.

The laggards

Just as some less renowned firms made the 100 Pointers list, some high-prestige firms turn out to be relative laggards. In a decade in which transactional work grew at a torrid pace, the strongest predictor of a firm’s PPP growth underperformance seems to be its reliance on litigation. Some of the weakest performers in the data set include Boies Schiller, Jones Day, and Curtis, Mallet. Each of these firms had a lower PPP in 2020 than in 2011. DC litigation specialist Williams & Connolly achieved slight PPP growth (2020 PPP was 1.19x 2011 PPP), but its RPL declined (0.89x). The largest pure litigation firm, Quinn Emmanuel, also delivered only modest PPP growth (1.12x), though its RPL growth was more respectable (1.42x).

Among the firms with more diversified offerings, it’s interesting to see some firms that have a reputation for growth turn in relatively mediocre performances in this analysis. For example, Gibson, Dunn grew its PPP over the decade by 1.67x, the same multiple achieved by Blank Rome and Stoel Rives. That’s a solid performance relative to a firm like Jones Day, but considering Gibson’s narrative of having grown into a true national powerhouse, it is striking to see the gap between its PPP growth and that of the 100 Pointer firms.

Implications: know your market value

If you are a current or future partner, the difference between being at a firm with strong PPP growth versus being stuck at a firm that is flat or declining is highly significant, to the tune of several million dollars over the course of your career. Simply put, if you are a partner at a firm on the upswing, you will attain outsized rewards. If you are at a flat firm, you will likely not realize the rewards of building your practice, as you will mainly find yourself feeding others. And if you are at a declining firm and you stick around too long, you will have left a huge sum on the table, which you will never recoup. Given that you are likely to work equally hard in all three scenarios, it’s not difficult to see which one is preferable.

Bottom line: it pays to understand how your firm is doing relative to your other options in this active lateral market. The time it takes to get ahead of the trends and learn your market value is time well invested. If you find that your current situation undervalues you, now is an opportune moment to make a move to a firm that is on a more promising trajectory.

# More Judicial Nominations From The Trump Administration
## We were right about a number of nominees; let's look ahead to the next batch.

‘You’re hired!’ (via YouTube)

Last week, I shared the names of [several possible judicial nominees](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/circuit-court-nominees-in-the-trump-administration-a-nationwide-round-up/) from the Trump administration. Last night, Adam Liptak of the New York Times broke the news of [ten forthcoming judicial nominations](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/07/us/politics/trump-lower-court-nominees-conservatives.html) from the White House — and of the five appeals-court nominees, four appeared on my earlier list: Amy Coney Barrett (Seventh Circuit), Joan Larsen (Sixth Circuit), Kevin Newsom (Eleventh Circuit), and David Stras (Eighth Circuit). (I missed [John K. Bush](https://www.bgdlegal.com/professionals/866/john-k.-bush/), who will be nominated to the Sixth Circuit.)

The nominees should please mainstream conservatives. As White House Counsel Don McGahn put it, the nominations deliver on President Trump’s campaign promise “to appoint strong and principled jurists to the federal bench who will enforce the Constitution’s limits on federal power and protect the liberty of all Americans.” Writing for the [National Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/447399/trump-proposes-excellent-slate-appellate-judicial-nominees), Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network hailed them as “an exceptional slate that carries on the tradition this president began by nominating Justice Gorsuch.”

At the same time, the nominees are mainstream thinkers and superbly qualified candidates, who should win confirmation with bipartisan support (well, at least in less polarized times). As [summed up](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/05/07/here-come-trumps-judges-president-to-put-forward-more-strong-judicial-nominees/?utm_term=.89a3f5bea7e2) by Professor Jonathan Adler, “The nominees make up an impressive list of highly respected jurists, attorneys and legal thinkers. Those of us who doubted Trump would take judicial nominations seriously may have some crow to eat.”

In addition to the circuit court nominees mentioned above, President Trump is nominating Dabney Friedrich to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Terry Moorer to the Middle District of Alabama, David Nye to the District of Idaho, Scott Palk to the Western District of Oklahoma, and Damien Schiff to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Interestingly enough, as pointed out by Vanessa Blum of the [National Law Journal](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202785505571/Trump-Set-to-Nominate-10-Federal-Judges?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL), Nye and Palk were previously nominated by President Obama but never confirmed. (But note that both Idaho and Oklahoma have two Republican senators each, so presumably the Nye and Palk nominations reflect support from their home state senators as opposed to Trump cutting a deal with Democrats.)

UPDATE (10:45 p.m.): The ten nominees are now official; see this release from the White House press office, [President Donald J. Trump Announces Judicial Candidate Nominations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/08/president-donald-j-trump-announces-judicial-candidate-nominations).

According to the senior White House official quoted by Liptak in the Times, we should get new nominees on a monthly basis. So let’s look ahead and try to predict who might wind up in future waves (in addition to the individuals I mentioned [last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/circuit-court-nominees-in-the-trump-administration-a-nationwide-round-up/) who didn’t make today’s round-up).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

I repeat the explanatory note from my [prior post](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/circuit-court-nominees-in-the-trump-administration-a-nationwide-round-up/): I communicated with many sources for this report, and I sent requests for comment to every possible nominee mentioned below for whom I could find contact information; they all did not get back to me or declined to comment. All of my sources insisted on strict anonymity, given the sensitivity of the subject and the fact that the appointments discussed herein have not yet been officially announced. So this story will contain very few direct quotations and be told from the perspective of an omniscient narrator, to preserve anonymity, but rest assured that it reflects extensive reporting.

Where are the openings in the federal judiciary? Current judicial vacancies are listed [here](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/current-judicial-vacancies), and anticipated vacancies are listed [here](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/future-judicial-vacancies). (Do a “find” on the page for “CCA” (“Circuit Court of Appeals”) to find the circuit seats on each list.)

As I did before, I’ll go circuit by circuit, but this time I’ll discuss district court as well as circuit court seats in each circuit. You’ll note that some courts get more coverage than others; this simply reflects where my sources come from. If you’d like more coverage of your judicial district or circuit, please help out by providing me with information, [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Judicial%20Nominations) (subject line: “Judicial Nominations”) or by text message (646-820-8477, including the words “Judicial Nominations” somewhere in your text).

Second Circuit

According to the [Buffalo News](http://buffalonews.com/2017/04/12/three-lawyers-two-republican-one-democrat-seek-federal-judgeship/), the two leading candidates for the open seat on the Western District of New York are [Amy Habib Rittling](https://www.lippes.com/talent/profile:amy-habib-rittling/), an employment and commercial litigator who’s a partner at Lippes Mathias Wexler Friedman, and [Jeremy Colby](http://www.websterszanyi.com/our-people/jeremy-a-colby/), former Erie County Attorney and current partner at Webster Szanyi. (Fun fact: check out Colby’s blog, [A Buffalo Lawyer](http://abuffalolawyer.blogspot.com/). Social media can sometimes get potential nominees in trouble, but my quick skim of the blog — which hasn’t been updated since, interestingly enough, right before Trump’s election — reveals nothing problematic.)

It’s not clear, however, that we’ll see movement on this seat anytime soon. Representative Chris Collins (R-NY) told the [Buffalo News](http://buffalonews.com/2017/04/18/collins-trump-may-not-appoint-judge-u-s-attorney-year/) that New York is on the back burner because [“blue slips”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-one-obstacle-to-an-originalism-driven-judiciary/2017/04/11/57aa2ae2-1e4e-11e7-a0a7-8b2a45e3dc84_story.html?utm_term=.ca3a871501ac) remain intact (for now) and the state has two Democratic senators — including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who apparently favors [Kathleen Sweet](http://www.gmclaw.com/atty-kathleen-sweet.html), a partner at Gibson, McAskill & Crosby, for the open seat.

Fourth Circuit

There’s an opening in the Eastern District of North Carolina. Rumored contenders including Magistrate Judge [Robert Numbers II](http://www.nced.uscourts.gov/pdfs/RTNBio.pdf), who practiced at Womble Carlyle before taking the bench in 2014, and [Thomas Farr](http://ogletree.com/people/thomas-a-farr), a shareholder at Ogletree Deakins. Numbers enjoys support from the Federalist Society, in which he played a local leadership role before becoming a judge, and Farr enjoys support from Republican Party figures.

The main problem for Farr is age (he’s in his 60s), although another issue is that he’d have to recuse from certain cases because of his past legal work for the Republican party. The White House Counsel’s office and the Republican senators diverge on some seats, and this one might be one of them: the White House likes younger nominees (like Numbers), while senators pay more attention to political concerns (like rewarding Farr for his service to the Republican Party).

Sixth Circuit

I previously [mentioned](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/circuit-court-nominees-in-the-trump-administration-a-nationwide-round-up/2/) Judge Allison Jones of the Kentucky Court of Appeals as a possibility for the second Kentucky seat on the Sixth Circuit (Judge Amul Thapar has been nominated to the first one), and I heard good things about her from folks on both sides of the aisle. For example, one progressive said to me, “Judge Jones for the Sixth Circuit? I’m a Trump-hating liberal, but I’m good with that. Good judge with a compelling personal story.”

But Judge Jones didn’t get the nod, at least not this time. Instead, the seat is going to [John Bush](https://www.bgdlegal.com/professionals/866/john-k.-bush/), a partner at Bingham Greenebaum Doll, where he co-chairs the litigation department. Bush has an impeccable résumé — Vanderbilt (summa cum laude), Harvard Law (cum laude), a long list of successful representations — and ties to both the Federalist Society and the Republican Party. (He currently serves as president of Fed Soc’s Louisville Lawyers Chapter.)

Here is one Kentucky source’s interesting take on Bush v. Jones:

Bush is a top-shelf corporate litigator, one of the best in that part of the country. Naming him is the Kentucky equivalent of, say, a Cravath litigation partner being named to the Second Circuit. He’s represented both KFC and Senator McConnell, and has a long history deep in the Republican Party and in the Federalist Society. Usually people like him don’t become judges because they don’t want to give up the big money, but maybe he’s made enough already.

If it really was between him and Allison Jones, then it’s potentially a “Trump betraying his base!” story. Bush is a big-shot corporate lawyer in Louisville, which the rest of Kentucky hates. Jones was elected to be a judge by all those Trump voters in rural Kentucky.

And wait, there’s more Kentucky judicial dish. There are two open district court seats in the state — one in the Eastern District, one in the Western — and for the Western District seat, one possible nominee is [Caroline Pitt Clark](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-clark-53709357/). Clark heads up government relations at KU Energy and is the daughter of M. Stephen Pitt, [general counsel](http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-governor/2015/11/10/steve-pitt-gov-bevin-general-counsel/75516502/) to Governor Matt Bevin.

Eighth Circuit

For the Eighth Circuit, I previously discussed the about-to-open Nebraska seat and also the Minnesota seat (which I correctly predicted going to Justice David Stras of the Minnesota Supreme Court). But what about the North Dakota seat?

We’ve heard several names, all of them plausible: Judge [Ralph Erickson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_R._Erickson), of the District of North Dakota; [Daniel Traynor](https://www.traynorlaw.com/daniel-m-traynor.html), who [previously served](https://www.rnla.org/bio/BioDetail.asp?MemberID=64) as state chairman for the Republican Party in North Dakota; and Justice [Jerod Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_E._Tufte), of the North Dakota Supreme Court.

Also in the mix, but less likely: assistant U.S. attorney [Jennifer Klemetsrud Puhl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Klemetsrud_Puhl), who was nominated to the Eighth Circuit under the prior administration ([thanks, Obama](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thanks-obama)). Senator Heidi Heitkamp is pushing for Puhl’s renomination, but she probably won’t get it unless some sort of deal is cut.

As for district courts within the Eighth Circuit, a seat in the Eastern District of Arkansas [will open up next year](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/future-judicial-vacancies), when Judge [J. Leon Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Leon_Holmes) takes senior status. Two possible nominees are [Chad Pekron](http://www.qgtlaw.com/attorney/chad-w-pekron/), a top commercial litigator and partner at Quattlebaum, Grooms & Tull, and [Bud Cummins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Cummins), a solo practitioner who [served as the Trump/Pence campaign chair in Arkansas](https://twitter.com/budcummins?lang=en) and [as U.S. Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Cummins) under President George W. Bush. (His departure from the post was part of the [U.S. attorney firing scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismissal_of_U.S._attorneys_controversy) — the 2006 controversy under President Bush, not the [2017 controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_dismissal_of_U.S._attorneys) under President Trump.)

Normally past service as a U.S. attorney gives someone the inside track on a district judgeship, but Cummins has the obstacle of age: he turns 58 this year. And we’ve discussed before the [importance of youth](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/who-will-president-trump-nominate-to-the-circuit-and-district-courts/) to the current White House when it comes to picking judicial nominees. (Similarly situated to Bud Cummins: Thomas Farr, discussed above, and Boris Feldman and Judge Michael Mosman, discussed [last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/some-possible-nominee-names-for-the-ninth-circuit/).)

UPDATE (11:25 p.m.): Judge Holmes’s retirement is a long way off (he’s not going senior until March 31, 2018), and vetting of possible successors has not yet begun.

Tenth Circuit

Tenth Circuit Judge Paul Kelly of New Mexico will be [going senior soon](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/future-judicial-vacancies) (exact date TBD). Many will seek his spot; two possibilities we’ve heard discussed are Judge [James O. Browning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_O._Browning), of the U.S. District Court for New Mexico, and Judge [J. Miles Hanisee](https://ballotpedia.org/J._Miles_Hanisee), of the New Mexico Court of Appeals.

Judge Browning, a graduate of Yale College and UVA Law, “is a solid conservative and generally viewed as one of the smartest people in the state,” according to one source. “He very nearly got the last New Mexico spot on the Tenth and would be the obvious pick except for age” (born in 1956, making him 61 this year). Judge Hanisee, while less of a known quantity than Judge Browning, is “generally conservative, and certainly younger.”

Speaking of the Tenth Circuit, I previously predicted Justice Allison Eid for the Colorado seat vacated by Justice Neil Gorsuch (with former Colorado solicitor general Daniel Domenico as an outside possibility). I stand by that prediction — as long as the seat gets filled, that is. As reported by [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/901822/judicial-conference-to-propose-57-new-federal-judgeships), the Judicial Conference of the United States will propose to Congress the creation of 57 new Article III judgeships — more spots for President Trump to fill — but will also advise Congress and the White House that two vacancies, Justice Gorsuch’s former Tenth Circuit seat and a District of Wyoming seat, don’t need to be filled because of low filing rates in those courts.

The Judicial Conference’s recommendations are not binding, so the Trump administration might ignore them — especially because it’s surely eager to place the highly regarded Justice Eid, one of candidate Trump’s [SCOTUS shortlisters](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/), on a federal appeals court. But if Democrats want to fight Justice Eid, precisely because she might be on a [“rocket ship to the Supreme Court,”](http://underneaththeirrobes.blogs.com/main/2005/04/judicial_sighta_4.html) this recommendation could serve as ammunition for them. Cf. the occasional (partisan) disputes over whether the D.C. Circuit needs to have all its seats filled.

# Morning Docket: 08.30.18
## * Trump Tweets out his demand that Chief Justice Roberts crack down on Judge Collyer for not using the FISA court to undermine the Russia probe. Did Trump do misspell Judge Collyer's name in the process? Oh you know by now that of course he did. [[Reuters via Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-bruce-ohr_us_5b879a1ee4b0162f471fa020)] * No sooner did a jury actually convict a cop of killing an unarmed black teen, did they turn around and sentence him to less than even the defense attorneys dreamed of. [[Courthouse News Service](https://www.courthousenews.com/jury-sentences-texas-killer-cop-to-15-years/)] * The SEC fined Moody's over poor controls, which seems about a decade too late, but whatever. [[Corporate Counsel](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2018/08/29/in-a-first-sec-fines-moodys-over-poor-controls-and-unclear-rating-symbols/)] * Is Rudy Giuliani using his relationship to the president to further his lobbying career? That would be really shocking for someone involved with this administration! [[National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/2018/08/29/giuliani-says-he-had-no-intention-of-hiding-effort-to-influence-romanian-government/)] * Eighth Circuit approves corporate discrimination efforts. [[The Recorder](https://www.law.com/2018/08/29/wells-fargo-lawfully-fired-employees-over-background-checks-appeals-court-says/)] * FIFA convict compared to John McCain... I guess because they'll both be spending time in captivity? [[NY Post](https://nypost.com/2018/08/29/convicted-fifa-bosss-lawyer-compares-him-to-john-mccain/)] * Clifford Chance slapped with fine for discriminating against non-U.S. citizens. You can take the firm out of Rogers & Wells, but you can't take the Rogers & Wells out of the firm. Seriously though, this was just a misunderstanding of ITAR regulations.

Twitter HR after being expected to do their jobs.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Each category related to law firms saw a drop in interest from existing lawyers and clerks, whereas the desire to go in-house rose significantly to 14% and the interest to go into government stayed consistent at around 16%. This data set shows that once practicing at a firm, many clerks and associates are interested in practicing law in a different, non-law-firm environment.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Based on survey responses, Gen-Zers’ long-term career objectives are veering away from traditional law firm paths.

— Excerpts from a new [report on Gen-Z lawyer preferences](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/10/gen-z-less-interested-in-big-law-and-traditional-law-firm-paths/) from Major, Lindsey & Africa, which noted that only 39% of law students who said they wanted to work at a law firm after graduation wanted to pursue Biglaw careers, which was about a 20% drop since 2020. On top of that, just 23% of Gen-Zers said their long-term career goal was to make partner at a law firm. Gen-Z lawyers who already work in Biglaw said more money and more opportunities for advancement would keep them in their jobs.

# Lawyer Suspended After Submitting An Inflated Résumé To A Biglaw Firm
## Lesson learned. We hope.

Don’t fake your résumé. Don’t fudge a few details; don’t be tempted to embellish just a smidge, I don’t care how cute [Second Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Act_(film)) was. The consequences, particularly for lawyers, can be quite severe if (when) you’re caught. Just ask Seth Asher Nadler.

Nadler has received a one-year suspension from the New Jersey Supreme Court over an inflated résumé and a falsified transcript that he submitted to Williams & Connolly. The highlights of his grade inflation include bumping up his GPA to 3.825 from 3.269, claiming he received honors in legal writing when the class was pass/fail (he got a P), and listing an article that he researched and wrote with three other people only without listing his co-authors. As the Disciplinary Review Board [notes](http://drblookupportal.judiciary.state.nj.us/DocumentHandler.ashx?document_id=1122516), his deception was quite extensive. In addition to the résumé boosting he did, Nadler admitted to a whopping 26 misrepresentations on the unofficial transcript that he submitted to Williams & Connolly. Yikes.

Williams & Connolly become hip to Nadler’s scheme when an alumnus of his law school — University of Minnesota — suspected something was amiss:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Sanjiv Laud, Esquire, a Williams & Connolly attorney and alumnus of the law school, reviewed respondent’s employment application. In August 2015, Laud contacted Erin Keyes, the [University of Minnesota] law school’s assistant dean of students, and expressed concern about respondent’s unofficial transcript. Keyes compared the unofficial and official transcripts, and confirmed that there were significant discrepancies. After Keyes contacted the law school’s career center, she concluded that inaccuracies existed between the résumé and unofficial transcripts that had been uploaded to the career center’s program and those that respondent had sent to Williams & Connolly.

Nadler [reportedly ](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer-suspended-for-boosting-law-school-grades-in-williams-connolly-application)says he had a justification for some of his résumé entries:

Nadler maintained that his legal writing professor told him that he could truthfully represent that he received honors in legal writing because of his arguments in the appellate advocacy section of the course. He also said he was told that he could cite the article without reference to the co-authors.

But the majority of the disciplinary review board did not cotton to the excuses:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The degree and scope of respondent’s deception, his steadfast commitment to demonstrably false claims, and his attempt to place blame on someone else, demonstrate a disturbing pattern of dishonesty, a refusal to admit wrongdoing, and an arrogant lack of contrition that cannot be countenanced. Moreover, nothing in the record serves to mitigate his misconduct, including his alleged depression, which is undiagnosed and untreated, other than a weekly conversation with someone at the NJLAP. Moreover, although respondent was an inexperienced attorney at the time of these events, one need not have experience to know that one should not lie. Inexperience may serve as mitigation for some shortcomings, but not for engaging in repeated acts of dishonesty, deception, and fabrication of documents.

That opinion pulls no punches. After reading that, you might think Nadler had the book thrown at him. But, though a majority of the disciplinary review board recommended a two-year suspension, the New Jersey Supreme Court settled on a one-year suspension. Let’s hope he’s learned a valuable lesson about embellishing your résumé.

# Reinventing The Law Business: A Potential Impediment To Growth, Culture, And Client Development (Part 2)
## If you run a law firm, you have to get “out and about” and talk directly with everyone involved in the enterprise.

Bruce Stachenfeld

In my [last article](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/reinventing-the-law-business-a-potential-impediment-to-growth-culture-and-client-development/), I wrote about the problems that arise when a law firm gets too big for a single person – a single brain – to be able to keep track of everything that is going on within the firm, including not only legal matters with clients, but culturally as well. Speaking from my vantage point as managing partner of my [law firm](http://www.dsllp.com/), I identified two major concerns that flow from this situation:

The obvious first problem is that I don’t know if bad things are happening, even though I am responsible for them. For all I know a partner is abusing an associate – a lawyer is mistreating a client – or any of a myriad of bad things is going on.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The second problem is even harder, which is how does each lawyer know what the other lawyers are doing?  This is a pernicious issue and has numerous repercussions. For example, if lawyer A doesn’t know that lawyer B is an expert in widget law, she will miss the opportunity when the client says to lawyer A:  “I wish I could find a widget lawyer somehow…..”

I promised in my last article to do my best to come up with solutions to the first problem in this (second) article and in my next (third and last) article to come up with solutions to the second problem. Here are my solutions to the first problem, i.e.. how does the boss learn if bad things are happening:

First – I make it super clear – incredibly clear – ridiculously clear – that not only will I not shoot a messenger that gives me bad news; instead, I will laud that messenger. This cannot be overdone or overstated. I have to assume that people at a lower rung on the ladder will be afraid to speak up against someone higher on the ladder. This is simple self-preservation and human nature. If someone summons up the courage to do so, it is important for me to strongly validate that action. Indeed, if someone really does speak up and gets shut down (or worse) for doing so, that result spreads like wildfire underground, and it will be a long time before I get any important information from the rank and file.

Second – I have learned I have to be even more proactive. I have found I learn a ton by periodically meeting with different groups at the firm. For example, I meet with the junior associates – the summer associates – the mid-level associates – the paralegals – the administrative team – the associates en masse – and so on. I don’t do this perfectly, of course, and sometimes kick myself for not doing it enough, but I make it my business to do so. These meetings always start off awkwardly but, once it is clear I am super sincere about earnestly soliciting guidance and advice and will take it seriously, people open up and I learn what I need to know.

Third – I walk around and talk informally with people. Actually, being honest, I am terrible about this. I don’t do it enough. I have the excuse that I am busy, but it is just an excuse. I know I am missing out by not doing this and I should do it more. Indeed, today I am going to spend some time just wandering around!

Fourth – I have found that it is critical to identify others in the associate ranks that are very “into” the firm and enlist their aid. I have found that typically there is an associate (we sometimes jokingly call a [“quidnunc”](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/quidnunc) (look it up)), who always knows what is going on and will give me the lowdown on things that need fixing, someone who is upset, someone needs help, etc. There is nothing better than sitting down for coffee with a quidnunc – trust me here.

Fifth – I have learned over the years that I absolutely cannot achieve a goal like this by myself. Somehow I have to get my partners to join with me. I have found that – luckily – in my firm this is not a problem. I am not “just saying” that I have good partners who genuinely care about the firm and those who work here – I genuinely do. Long ago, I tried to be responsible for this initiative myself and I plain old failed. Today, my partners do as much in this area as I do and, many of them do much more. It is a group effort. My influence is critical in making clear – as managing partner – how important I believe this is for our success that we do not let this problem harm us, but ultimately I am one out of about thirty partners.

Sixth – I make it my business to interact as much as I can with clients even if I am not doing the day-to-day work. I don’t just look to avoid screw-ups – I do a lot more than that. I probe to find out whether the client is incredibly over-the-top over-satisfied and thrilled with our law firm and its services. If not, then I consider this an alarm-bell problem that must be promptly rectified. I have learned I will not get this information by just sitting in my office. I have to go out and get it firsthand.

Along these lines, there is a great book written by Andrew Grove, the late founder of Intel Corporation, called [Only the Paranoid Survive](http://amzn.to/29Bx5Nx) (affiliate link). I read it long ago, but in it Grove emphasizes how easy it is – and how dangerous – for the CEO to cut herself off from what is happening with the outside world. She is the last to know that customers are pissed off since the pissed-off customer rolls his eyes at the salesman (who is way down in the pyramid) and no one wants to deliver this news up-chain. The CEO is sometimes the last to know of critical problems. Hence, the title “Only the Paranoid Survive”.

To summarize all of the above – which neatly knits into a single concept – if you are running a law firm (or any business) and want to solve, or avoid, this pernicious and dangerous problem, you have to get “out and about” and talk directly with everyone from the people at the bottom of your administrative team to your most senior partners to your clients and everyone else that has an effect on your enterprise. If you just sit in your office, you simply have no clue what is happening good or bad. And, since you are running the show, you are responsible, whether or not you know about it. Ignorance is no excuse.

# Law Firms Should Not Own Law Schools
## While the ""Cravath School of Law"" sounds interesting in theory, it will not work in practice.

Law schools need a serious overhaul. Attendance is dropping year after year, students with high GPAs are considering other options, and those who are attending are being more aggressive about seeking tuition discounts (at least they should be.)

What is going to make law school great again? Jay Conison, the former dean of Charlotte School of Law, thinks that [law firms should own law schools](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/should-law-firms-own-law-schools_us_59305b70e4b09e7836228f70).

He claims that law firm ownership would provide large-scale benefits. He does not give specific examples. Instead, he claims that ownership would somehow increase efficiency and collaboration between the law school and the firm. He also claims that it could achieve the recommendations of the [Report of the Task Force on the Future of Legal Education](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/report_and_recommendations_of_aba_task_force.authcheckdam.pdf) by enabling the profession to “recapture its former substantial role in the education of new lawyers.” He then points to three specific recommendations: providing value to students, recognizing that law school exists to develop competencies, and changing faculty culture and work.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Let’s talk about value. Law school is a professional school. While almost all law students want to learn about the intricacies of the law, they also want to earn a living practicing law. So the “value” of a legal education is measured by cost of attendance and the job prospects after graduation. The so-called “intrinsic value” of a legal education can be obtained during bar review courses and work experience.

As for competencies, while a law firm setting might be a better place to teach practice skills, those skills might be applicable only to that particular firm. I would be concerned about whether those skills can be transferable to a peer firm, a smaller or larger firm, or an in-house or government position.

Finally, his call to change faculty work and culture sounds suspiciously like eliminating tenure and replacing it with most law firms’ cutthroat partnership promotion model. It will be amusing to see how many tenured professors would agree to this.

Conison then lays out the benefits of the law firm ownership model for the firm and the school:

Owning a law school can aid the work of the firm. One benefit could be the creation of a pipeline of new attorneys. These attorneys, in fact, may have been educated under an educational program that the firm helped develop in light of the firm’s approaches and needs. Another benefit could be a pipeline for firm diversity, something with which firms continue to struggle. Ownership of a school could also create a new source of revenue for the firm. And over time, as the school develops an alumni network, that network could be a source of firm clients.

Conison’s other proposed benefits are not likely to materialize. While law firms can shape its students in their own image, will that make the students marketable to other law firms? As for [diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/back-in-the-race-law-firms-privately-do-not-care-about-hiring-a-diverse-workforce/), law firms care only to the extent it will help business. Also, most law schools today are losing money as they adjust to the new normal. And if there is an alumni network, are members going to refer clients to the mother firm, or to other alumni working elsewhere who might charge less?

Next, Conison discusses the benefits to the students:

Being owned by a firm could advance the career-related goals some schools now pursue in establishing their own firms or other legal services organizations. Thus, the firm-school structure could provide a path to entry-level (and other) jobs for graduates, as well as internships for current students. It could also provide students and alumni with access to firm clients, who might be another source of internships or jobs. The firm-school relationship could also provide a source of faculty, particularly ones who understand the school’s curriculum and culture, and who could step in as adjuncts or full-time faculty quickly. The relationship could also immediately provide a strong brand for the school. If the Smith & Jones firm is a well-known and respected firm, the Smith & Jones School of Law would instantly benefit from the firm’s brand halo.

In short, he thinks a firm-owned school can better assist its graduates in the job market. While all of the above sounds good in theory, I am skeptical because this will not solve the unemployment and underemployment problem caused by lawyer oversupply.

I sincerely would like Professor Conison’s idea to work. If a firm-owned school can successfully place most of its graduates into desirable jobs through its own connections, it won’t have to deal with headaches like managing its national rank, and maybe even some of the more burdensome ABA accreditation rules. Second- and third-year (if needed) students can opt to gain work experience at the firm instead of taking classes.

But I see two major problems. The fixed costs alone of running a law school will make it almost impossible for solo practitioners or small firms to do this. Also, most law firms – even the large ones – probably won’t have enough work to give to their students, and will not be able to absorb graduates into full-time positions at the firm.

The only way I see this model working is if the school is owned and operated by a reputable firm and it accepts only a small number of students to minimize overhead expenses and to ensure that their graduates are able to work for the firm or transition elsewhere. The students can take classes in the firm’s conference room and can work at their designated areas. Also, it would be more economical for law firms to create the school from the ground up rather than buying out an existing one, especially ones that have reputation issues and consistently low bar passage rates.

While the “Cravath School of Law” sounds interesting in theory, it will not work in practice. It does not solve the lawyer oversupply problem, and law firms are not likely to be receptive to this model. And no major law firm is going to be the white knight for an existing “opportunity and diversity” law school because it will be cheaper for them to start their own from scratch. While we all should explore new ideas for reforming legal education, this idea should stay academic.

# West Coast Represents In The Salary Wars!
## This must be a relief to WSGR associates -- and associates at peer firms -- that they've made their announcement.

It’s salary raise season in Biglaw, and that means your friendly neighborhood Above the Law editors are getting a lot of complaints from associates that have been left out in the cold by their firms. One of the most repeated concerns was the lack of West Coast representation on [the list of firms that have increased associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/). Sure, Irell was an early adopter, but none of the big Bay Area/ Silicon Valley firms have ponied up market salaries.

Until now. Wilson Sonsini just announced they were increasing associate salary, and giving out a special summer bonus in accordance with the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale. As the new standard for associate compensation has been spreading through the Am Law 100 a lot more slowly than the associate raises of 2016, it is probably a relief to WSGR associates — and associates at peer firms — that they’ve made their announcement.

And now, here are the increasingly familiar base salaries at WSGR as well as the special bonuses:

# Is The Second-Tier NYC Salary Market Emerging?
## It's OK to not match Cravath as long as you're consistent with attorney expectations.

We have another salary increase, and while most of our posts on that subject can have a deja vu feel, occasionally we get one that bucks the full Cravath match. Usually such a firm is opting out of driving salaries through the roof in a [smaller market](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/) or is [up for some shaming](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/one-firm-decides-to-pump-the-brakes-on-this-whole-raise-thing/) for trying to cheap out on its labor force.

But then there are some firms that probably should fall into a second-tier when it comes to associate compensation — and should embrace that role before they [bankrupt themselves trying to compete with Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/).

[Olshan Frome Wolosky](http://www.olshanlaw.com), a [respected midsize firm](http://www.olshanlaw.com/resources-mentions-Olshan-Midsize-Hotlist.html), informed its associates that it would be boosting first year salaries to $170K, with more senior salaries communicated individually. We’ve posted the memo on the next page.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Olshan was already paying first-years $150K, so this maintains their approach of paying $10K below the high end of the market. However, it’s interesting to see someone openly resist the urge of so many non-elite players to match Cravath. We don’t have any data on the salaries beyond those of first years, but it’s probably safe to say these don’t ratchet up at the same pace they would at Cravath.

And that’s perfectly fine. Associates who move to Olshan did so with their eyes open. They did it to be well-compensated at a rate just a notch below the top of the market in exchange for an opportunity that fit their careers better than staying chained to a Biglaw behemoth ever would. So, as long the firm keeps itself in line with what they expected, everyone should be happy.

Is it possible a second-tier salary comp market is starting to reveal itself?

When your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

It’s officially Biglaw bonus season (even though only one firm has [announced 2020 bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) thus far), so why not give employees the added bonus of eliminating COVID-19 austerity measures and reinstating all salaries in full?

That’s what’s happening at Schiff Hardin, a firm that brought in $186,437,000 gross revenue in 2019, ranking 158th on the Am Law 200. If you recall, back in April, the firm instituted some of the [largest associate pay cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/50-percent-pay-cut-schiff-hardin/?rf=1) we’d heard about during the coronavirus crisis. While the majority of attorneys saw a 15 percent compensation cut, certain practice areas took an astonishing 50 percent hit. Staff making $100,000+ were also subject to up to a 15 percent cut, and the firm also laid off some staff members.

After months of suffering, all of this bad news is finally coming to and end.

A spokesperson for Schiff Hardin provided the below statement, which details all of the steps the firm took to make associates and staff whole:

Like other firms, Schiff Hardin has been carefully managing its business in response to the economic impact of the pandemic. Beginning in April we reduced some attorney and staff salaries. Despite the challenges 2020 has presented, the firm has performed well. We restored everyone’s salaries for the second quarter in August and for the third quarter in October. We are pleased that we will also restore salaries for the fourth quarter at the end of December, so that our attorneys and staff receive their full salaries for the entire year.

Congratulations to Schiff Hardin for its excellent performance. With their salaries restored, the firm’s employees are sure to have an extra happy holiday season.

# Sure, Goodwin Just Laid Off A Bunch Of Lawyers, But That Doesn't Mean They're Going To Stop Adding Laterals
## Good news for the firm, not good news for the attorneys who were recently laid off.

In ordinary times, news of a practice group lateraling from one Biglaw firm to another would be treated in a pretty perfunctory way. Sure, it’s good news for the group’s new firm and not great news for the old firm, but so it goes in the Biglaw lateral carousel. But, when we have Biglaw firms laying off ~90 attorneys, we are no longer in ordinary times.

You’ll remember, of course,[ Goodwin Procter’s decision](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) earlier this month to cut back on its headcount. Overall, it laid off 5% of its workforce, saying, “After much thought and careful reflection, we concluded that—regrettably—our current staffing levels are too high for our current and projected demand.” But not all staffing decisions are the same.

We’ve learned that a group of Troutman Pepper partners in the Health Sciences group are leaving the firm for… Goodwin. From an internal email sent around Troutman last week:

While exact numbers are in flux, the lateral move is likely to ultimately include associates as well. A tipster at the firm notes associates potentially making the move with the partners who have turned in their notice are excited to “finally” get paid market salaries. I guess there has to be some benefit to moving to a firm so recently in the news for layoffs.

I’m sure this group has an impressive book of business that Goodwin is excited to add to their ledgers. But the timing is… not great. It’s bad enough to get axed from your firm, but when that’s coupled with the same firm excitedly expanding in other areas it has to add salt to that wound.

When reached for comment, a representative for Troutman Pepper had this to say, “We can confirm that certain attorneys have given notice of their intention to leave our firm. We appreciate their contributions to Troutman Pepper and wish them well in their future endeavors.”

# RBG's Words Are A Literal Work Of Art
## A true legal fan is going to snap this up.

Justice Ginsburg’s transformation into a pop culture icon was certainly a gradual process for years, but it feels like it kicked into warp speed over the last couple years. She’s been featured in books, earned a badass nickname, landed in an acclaimed documentary, and a feature-length historical drama. Back in 2015, the noted fan could only be excited to be the [subject of an opera](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/atl-opera-review-scaliaginsburg/). In retrospect, that was probably the inflection point where she began rocketing toward superstardom.

Now she can add, “work of art” to her list of accomplishments. As [Law.com reports](https://www.law.com/2019/02/21/an-artist-transforms-this-rbg-landmark-ruling-into-her-portrait/):

Geoffrey Stein is [showing](https://www.denisebibrofineart.com/artworks/r-b-g/) the 30 x 30 inch-collage, R.B.G. 2019, at Denise Bibro Fine Art in New York City. Ginsburg’s 1996 opinion in United States v. Virginia, which struck down the male-only admissions policy at the Virginia Military Institute, is the material for the collage. Stein worked with acrylic and pencil on canvas.

The work, which shows Ginsburg’s headshot superimposed over a collage of the majority opinion doesn’t have an official price — so if you’re in the market, you’re going to have to lob an inquiry to the gallery — but one imagines some Biglaw firm would get in the running for a work like this to adorn the halls. It’s hard enough to find engaging art for a top-flight law firm, let alone art that also strikes a legal theme.

Plus, with a prominent woman of the law staring at attorneys every day, it might just make them take a second and wonder if they’re doing all they can to ensure the firm’s female population isn’t confined to the walls.

# Those Predicted Big Biglaw Rate Increases? They're Going To Be Bigger
## Big bills ahead in 2023.

Biglaw didn’t have a great 2022. Demand was down — particularly in some corporate practices. Layoffs are happening. And profits are expected to be down. With the economic uncertainty looming in the background of all this, the question many legal industry watchers have is, “How will Biglaw respond?”

At the end of last year, Wells Fargo Legal Specialty Group [predicted](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/clients-better-get-ready-for-some-supersized-biglaw-rate-increases-in-2023/) the industry would respond with 7-8% rate hikes for 2023; after all, the billable hour remains the number one way firms make their money. But based on new data [collected by Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/rising-rates-are-law-firms-salve-as-layoffs-and-pay-cuts-surge), those increases look like they’re going to be even bigger.

By taking a look at bankruptcy court filings, Roy Strom is tracking the rate increases of 2023:

The firms don’t readily advertise their billing rates. But bankruptcy courts provide a source of transparency. Firms are required to disclose how much they bill, and they notify courts—and bankruptcy watchdogs at the U.S. Trustees’ offices—when they plan to raise rates.

This year, at least 11 law firms have notified courts they are charging more for their services.

Of those increasing billing rates, the average increase for partner rate is a 9.7% increase — higher than the predicted bump. However, the mode of rate increases — 6 of the 11 — increased partner rate between 7% and 8% as expected. Associate rate increases spanned a greater range, from a 0% increase to 19.6%, with the average settling at a 9% bump.

Of course, no matter how illuminating this data is, it’s from only 11 firms. But clients should definitely be aware — your legal bill is probably going up.

# Legal Recruiting And You: How The Sausage Is Made
## NALP is a quasi-governing body that oversees legal recruiting from both the law school and Biglaw perspective.

So far, and indeed going forward, this column has focused on providing advice for law students and alumni on the ins and outs of the legal hiring process as seen through the lens of the Career Services Office. But I also want to use this space to pull back the curtain a bit and show those who might not be familiar a bit of what the legal recruiting system looks like from my side of the desk.  Because their [Annual Education Conference](http://www.cvent.com/events/2018-nalp-annual-education-conference/event-summary-5ea5f2f388a0499c978e607e69f9fe87.aspx?CFID=4763925&CFTOKEN=95332688) is currently happening, there is no better place to begin this look than with the [National Association for Law Placement (NALP)](https://www.nalp.org).  As I explain to my first-year students each fall, NALP is a quasi-governing body (though in reality, it is more of a forum) that oversees legal recruiting from both the law school and Biglaw perspective, akin to the NCAA, except that NALP thinks its members deserve to be duly compensated for their work.

NALP provides a number of services that all law students should be putting to good use.  The [NALP Directory of Legal Employers](https://www.nalpdirectory.com) is a fantastic repository of all types of information regarding its Biglaw members, including an array of hiring statistics and compensation figures.  Of particular interest to those just starting law school, the Directory might be the single best place to find firms that hire 1Ls as part of their summer program.  For those pursuing a career in public interest, the [Public Service Job Directory](https://www.psjd.org/) is a well-known repository of job postings and employer profiles, but less well-known is that the PSJD is a NALP initiative (a fact that is on the home page, albeit in very small font).  NALP also provides reams of data on all aspects of legal recruiting and employment, including [law firm diversity](https://www.nalp.org/diversity2).  NALP members can even review [statistics](https://www.nalp.org/legalcareerprofessionals) on the nature of Career Services Offices themselves, including salaries.

But perhaps the most important NALP product is the “[Principles and Standards for Law Placement and Recruitment Activities](https://www.nalp.org/fulltextofnalpprinciplesandstandards).”  In short, these are the rules of legal recruiting.  Why do firms give students 28 days to accept a summer offer?  Part V.B.1 states, “Employers offering full-time positions to commence following graduation to candidates not previously employed by them should leave those offers open for at least 28 days following the date of the offer letter or until December 30, whichever comes first.”  Why can students only hold five offers open at once during fall recruiting?  Look to Part V.A.3.: “A candidate should not hold open more than five offers of employment at any one time. For each offer received that places a candidate over the offer limit, the candidate should, within one week of receipt of the excess offer, release an offer.”  Any law student who is even considering taking part in the fall recruiting cycle should read the Principles and Standards thoroughly and know them as if it were their Torts outline.  Also, as you go through the recruiting process, if you think a law firm is in violation of the Principles and Standards, reach out to your school’s CSO immediately.

As mentioned above, this week is the NALP Annual Education Conference in “South Florida” — as a native Miamian, anything North of [Joe Robbie Stadium](https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/11/11/16628422/miami-stadium-name-dolphins-hurricanes) (yes, that will always be the stadium’s name) might as well be Georgia or Alabama — and while I am not in attendance, I took a look at the [Conference agenda](http://www.cvent.com/events/2018-nalp-annual-education-conference/agenda-5ea5f2f388a0499c978e607e69f9fe87.aspx) as it provides good sense of the important issues currently floating around the recruiting world.

Some of the discussions center around relatively mundane topics such as which CSO database is superior between Symplicity and 12twenty, to which I channel Washington State football coach Mike Leach.

But other panels touch on topics of vital importance.  Evergreen issues such as the need to develop and retain a more diverse and inclusive set of law students and lawyers will be discussed on multiple occasions, including how best to engage and empower first generation law students.  How not to overload 1Ls when their heads are already spinning from everything else that the first few months of law school throws at them will also be discussed as will how to deal with students dealing with mental illness or substance abuse.  Topics which are more of the moment include how best to deal with an ever-shortening recruiting timeline that is creeping ever further into the summer and how to adjust recruiting efforts in this #MeToo moment.

NALP is a vital organization for not only those of us directly involved in legal recruiting, but for everyone in the legal realm.  Over the next several days by the beach, its members will tackle some of the most pressing issues in legal recruiting, hopefully coming up with some answers, or at least a bit more understanding.

Nicholas Alexiou is the Director of LL.M. and Alumni Advising as well as the Associate Director of Career Services at Vanderbilt University Law School. He will, hopefully, respond to your emails at [abovethelawcso@gmail.com](mailto:abovethelawcso@gmail.com).

# Which Biglaw Firms Have The Biggest And Best 401(k) Plans?
## One firm -- guess which one -- has a plan with an average account balance of $2.1 million.

If you’re a Biglaw associate, what should you do with that nice bonus check? It’s okay to drop some cash on [holiday shopping](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/the-lawyer-holiday-gift-guide-the-best-gifts-for-the-attorney-in-your-life/), and you should also share your bounty [with the less fortunate](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/how-will-you-be-spending-your-biglaw-bonus/).

But you would also be well advised to put some of your bonus money toward retirement saving. Millions of Americans — including lawyers, and even [Biglaw partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/are-you-and-your-law-firm-ready-for-retirement/) — [don’t have enough saved for retirement](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/empire-of-the-fund-an-interview-with-william-birdthistleor-4-tips-for-lawyers-on-saving-for-retirement/).

If your firm offers a 401(k) plan, you should try your best to [“max out,”](https://www.betterment.com/resources/retirement/planning-ahead/why-you-should-max-out-your-retirement-accounts/) i.e., contribute as much as you legally can. If you’re lucky enough to have an employer who matches your contributions up to a point, you should definitely get all the matching money on the table.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And make no mistake, some Biglaw firms have very big 401(k) plans. From [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/is-big-law-ready-to-retire-largest-401k-plans-in-the-industry/) (via [Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/morning-docket-12-02-16/)):

The 401(k) plan at Latham & Watkins LLP is the largest plan among the nation’s 50 top-grossing law firms, according to Bloomberg BNA’s analysis.

Latham’s plan has more than $1.2 billion in assets and 4,899 active participants. The second place in terms of plan size goes to Kirkland & Ellis LLP. The firm’s retirement plan has more than $941 million in assets and 4,155 participants.

You can check out the complete top 10 over at [Big Law Biz](https://bol.bna.com/is-big-law-ready-to-retire-largest-401k-plans-in-the-industry/).

That’s a ranking by total assets. Which plans have the largest average accounts? The top plan shouldn’t come as a huge surprise:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
In terms of the size of the individual account balances, employees at Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP have some of the largest 401(k) accounts in the legal industry. The almost 200-year-old firm has one retirement plan in which its 133 participants, mainly partners and selected employees, enjoy an average account of $2.1 million, according to the firm’s latest annual report.

Based on the high average balance and fairly low number of participants, I’m guessing that associates are in a separate plan. (Associates are able to contribute to a 401(k) plan, per [Cravath’s website](https://www.cravath.com/benefits/).)

The second-ranked firm by average balance limits its plan to partners and certain counsel:

O’Melveny & Myers LLP also has a profit-sharing plan in which its 227 participants — partners and eligible counsel attorneys — have accumulated an average balance of $1.1 million in their accounts.

Retirement plans at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, Shearman & Sterling LLP, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, Millbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy LLP, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP follow closely behind. These firms have plans in which average accounts per participant range from $467,299 to $865,353.

Without knowing more, it’s hard to make “apples to apples” comparisons of these plans. As Big Law Business notes, there’s a lot of variation. Some firms have a single plan for all employees, while others have separate plans for different groups. The plans have different features and investment options. And some firms also have [traditional pension plans](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204571404577258082978298056), generally for partners, that come on top of 401(k) plans.

Working in Biglaw isn’t easy. A few years ago, a career satisfaction survey concluded that “Associate” is the [unhappiest job in America](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/03/unhappiest-job-in-america-take-a-guess/) (and “Partner” [isn’t a bowl of cherries](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/07/is-being-a-partner-the-worst-job-in-biglaw/) either). But there’s no denying that practicing law at the highest levels comes with [rich financial rewards](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/where-do-lawyers-fall-in-the-top-income-brackets/).

Larry Nassar (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)

You think your job is bad? Does it include cleaning up the mess following (arguably) the worst sexual abuse scandal to ever rock higher education that left more than 250 victims in its wake? No? Then maybe you don’t have it so bad.

The in-house legal department at Michigan State University — the school that until recently employed Larry Nassar, the doctor sentenced to [40-125 years](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/in-an-utterly-unsurprising-move-judge-throws-the-book-at-larry-nassar/) in prison for abusing young athletes entrusted to his care — is dealing with the repercussions of Nassar’s actions. [According to Law.com](https://www.law.com/2018/04/23/10-reasons-to-be-glad-youre-not-an-in-house-lawyer-at-michigan-state-university/), that includes 10 ongoing investigations.

Here are the some of the most serious matters on MSU’s legal plate:

Clery Act Investigation 

On January 18th the Department of Education announced they were looking into MSU’s compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The law requires schools that participate in federal financial aid programs to maintain and disclose various crime statistics

On February 26th, the Department of Education announced they were also looking into MSU’s compliance with Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, saying:

“This new Title IX investigation will look at systemic issues in the university’s handling of sex-based incidents involving Dr. Larry Nassar. Our Office for Civil Rights team will be in East Lansing shortly where they will join the Federal Student Aid team already on site [performing the Clery Act review].”

NCAA Inquiry

MSU is also under pressure from the NCAA:

“The NCAA has sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University regarding potential NCAA rules violations related to the assaults Larry Nassar perpetrated against girls and young women, including some student-athletes at Michigan State.”

Michigan Attorney General Investigation

The state AG’s office has started their own investigation:

“It is abundantly clear that a full and complete investigation of what happened at Michigan State University, from the president’s office on down, is required. This investigation is and will continue to be independent, thorough, transparent and prompt.”

And the former dean of the MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine (Nassar’s supervisor), [William Strampel](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/G/GYM_DOCTOR_SEXUAL_ASSAULT_MICHIGAN_STATE?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT), has been indicted on criminal sexual misconduct, willful neglect of duty, and misconduct by a public official charges.

Higher Learning Commission Inquiry

MSU is under “governmental investigation” by the Midwestern accreditation commission.

The purpose of the designation “is to inform the public that an investigation by governmental agencies warrants concern from HLC as the accrediting agency,” the commission said in its statement. It noted accreditation implications related to “institutional integrity, effective leadership, and processes for complaints and grievances, given the allegations present in the ongoing investigations of the university.”

Plus there are inquiries from the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Senate Commerce Subcommittee, Michigan Senate and Michigan House of Representatives. Let’s not forget that former MSU General Counsel Robert Noto resigned in February amid criticism of his handling of the Nassar matter. That means that outside attorney [Robert Young Jr.](http://www.dickinson-wright.com/our-people/robert-young?tab=0), of counsel at Dickinson Wright, is leading the school’s responses.

Given the scope and horrific nature of Nassar’s crimes it makes sense that the legal clean up will be arduous.

# Did A Biglaw Partner Get Fired For Supporting LGBT Causes?

Alfred Zaher

Whenever a partner abruptly leaves a firm, there is a story there. Now most of the time we never hear the details, but sometimes we strike gold. According to a lawsuit filed last week, a former [Blank Rome](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/blank-rome/) intellectual property partner, [Alfred Zaher](http://www.bipc.com/Alfred-W-Zaher/), claims he was terminated by the firm for hosting an event for LGBT lawyers. As Law360 [reports](http://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/755568/ex-blank-rome-ip-atty-says-he-was-axed-over-lgbt-support):

Alfred W. Zaher claimed he was abruptly terminated after Chairman and Managing Partner Alan J. Hoffman allegedly expressed disapproval of Zaher’s staging of a meeting of 70 LGBT Philadelphia attorneys at Blank Rome’s offices.

Blank Rome allegedly said it fired Zaher because he had “lost the confidence of his partners,” according to the suit. But Zaher on Wednesday said the claim was pretextual and that the firing was motivated by Hoffman’s alleged personal animus toward Zaher.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Seems like a strong reaction to using a conference room. But perhaps there was some bad blood between the two partners. The lawsuit also claims that [Alan Hoffman](https://www.blankrome.com/index.cfm?contentID=10&bioID=410) made comments about Zaher’s appearance and mannerism during meetings.

The complaint does more than just air Zaher’s grievances against Hoffman, as he claims there was some shady stuff going down over his book of business. According to the lawsuit, when Zaher was leaving the firm the IP group’s chair, [Timothy Pecsenye](https://www.blankrome.com/index.cfm?contentID=10&bioID=1716), took an associate and visited Zaher’s clients, saying Zaher was leaving the firm due to “ethical issues.”

As one might imagine, Blank Rome intends to defend itself against these allegations, as it explained to Law360:

“For more than 70 years, Blank Rome has been committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse work environment,” the firm said. “We are proud of the distinction we received under Alan Hoffman’s leadership and support for achieving a perfect score of 100 percent on the 2016 Corporate Equality Index in recognition of our policies and practices related to LGBT workplace equality.”

# More Law Firms Should Buy Work-From-Home Items For Employees

Many individuals within the legal industry are working from home in order to promote social distancing and keep everyone safer as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage. Although some law firms have inexplicably [reopened their offices too soon](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/law-firms-should-be-shamed-for-reopening-offices-too-soon/), most managers realize that employees can complete almost all of their work tasks from home instead of trekking to an office. Many partners have lamented in recent months that having employees work from home has decreased productivity and hurt the profits of many shops. In order to boost the productivity of workers, and give employees the support they need, more law firms should be open to the idea of purchasing work-from-home items like furniture, computer monitors, and other equipment for employees.

There is nothing new about employers purchasing work-from-home items for employees. Most law firms provide their employees with laptops that they can use to complete work tasks from pretty much anywhere. In addition, some employers take their commitment to virtual work a little further and are open to purchasing computer monitors, furniture, and other items needed to effectively work from home.

About five years ago, my brother worked at a financial company that allowed employees to work from home once a week. The employer bought computer monitors for my brother so that he could more easily see the spreadsheets and other financial documents he needed to review in order to successfully complete his job. The investment required to equip my brother with the monitors and other items needed to be more productive working from home cost only several hundred dollars, but this investment likely paid dividends in the output my brother was able to provide his employer and their clients.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There is no reason why more law firms could not make a similar investment in work-from-home items, which would empower employees to be more productive while working from home. Law firms already pay for their employees to attend conferences, comply with CLE rules, attend business development outings, and other professional development expenses. The several hundred dollars it would take to equip each employee to work from home would be just a drop in the bucket compared to all of these other costs.

In some instances, employees could really use the equipment firms would purchase in order to be productive at home. Many workers across the country are making do with whatever arrangement they have at home to perform work. Numerous individuals are working from the couch, and I have seen a few attorneys I know set up card tables and folding chairs in order to create makeshift home offices. Such arrangements are not ideal, since they do not provide workers the best opportunity to type and be effective at their tasks. In addition, and I am no expert, but sitting on a folding chair or in other arrangements can hurt your back and potentially cause health issues.

Employers may argue that it is up to employees to create a proper home office so that they can be productive at their jobs and they can always come to the office if they can’t work from home. However, some people simply do not have the money needed to properly create a home office. It can cost hundreds of dollars or more to outfit a home office depending on the equipment a worker already has at home and what they may need to effectively complete their work. Many people are having a difficult time getting by in these tough times, and it may be onerous for some workers to pay for work-from-home items themselves. In addition, since there is less job security than there was in recent years, workers may not feel comfortable shelling out money to outfit a home office that may be useless if they lose a job. Employers should step up here by providing employees the support they need to thrive at virtual work. Arguing that employees can come to the office if they can’t be productive at home is no excuse because health worries and social distancing makes this impractical in most situations.

Some employers may argue that it is difficult for them to purchase all of this equipment for workers. Indeed, employers may believe it onerous to have such equipment returned after an employee leaves a firm and to process all of the requests to have work-from-home items paid for by a law firm. However, the amount of money needed to outfit most home offices is relatively small, and if law firms are so worried about practicalities, they can just let workers keep the items when they leave the firm. Indeed, I have heard of employers doing this in the past, since some employers do not care about recouping the several hundred dollars of work-from-home items they may have paid for an employee. Maybe employers can emblazon any work-from-home equipment with their firm’s name like they do for other swag so that even if an employee keeps the items, the firm gets free advertising!

All told, partners should not lament a reduction in productivity during the pandemic unless they have done everything needed to support the virtual work of their employees. Paying for work-from-home items could help employees be more productive and assist workers at a time that they could really use the support. Although some practical matters need to be hammered out, this should not keep more firms from paying for work-from-home items needed to boost the productivity of virtual workers.

# Struggling Firm's Bank Refuses To Issue Money For Paychecks

You will have heard from your Employee Representatives on Thursday that salaries were due to be paid on Friday last or yesterday. I am very sorry to have to tell you that this payment will not be paid, and no further salary payments will be made (with the exceptions set out below).

Barclays, our bankers, indicated to me on Thursday evening that they were not willing to approve the salary payments due to you. I made a proposal to the bank on Friday to counter this, asking that essential payments including salaries be paid. This proposal was rejected on Friday. I made a further proposal to ensure salary payments could be made on Sunday and this, also, was rejected. A final proposal was submitted to the bank last night and, with deepest regret, this too was rejected this morning.

— [Tim Bednall](http://www.kwm.com/en/au/people/tim-bednall), the managing partner of the European arm of [King & Wood Mallesons](http://www.kwm.com/en), explaining in an internal email sent to staff members that [they would not receive their paychecks](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2017/01/10/the-bank-has-put-us-in-an-impossible-situation-bednalls-email-to-kwm-europe-staff/) because Barclays refused to authorize further payment. All staff members at the firm have worked for free since the start of the new year, and will now be forced to apply to the firm’s administrators to [claim their pay](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202776483655/Barclays-Refuses-Payments-to-KWME-Staffers?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=10). The firm has struggled since other Biglaw firms began poaching partners, and has since filed a notice to appoint administrators.

‘Your firm is HUGE!’ (Image via Getty)

Ever since the recession hit, law schools have enrolled and graduated fewer and fewer students, and the legal profession as a whole took a major hit, having lost about 500,000 to 600,000 jobs that may never return. But despite the layoffs en masse that were a toll of the recession, the biggest of Biglaw firms are still employing thousands and thousands of attorneys — and they’ve been quickly growing in size.

But which U.S. Biglaw firm is the biggest of them all? [Law360](https://www.law360.com/ip/articles/1158713/law360-reveals-400-largest-us-firms) (sub. req.) can help us answer that question. Last night, the website released its master list of the top 400 law firms in the U.S. by headcount, revealing that Kirkland maintained its stranglehold on the No. 1 spot, growing by more than 14 percent over the course of 2018 (with over 300 domestic attorneys more than the firm in second place on the ranking).

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Compared to last year’s ranking, the biggest of all Biglaw firms have remained the same, but have shifted ever so slightly in their positions, growing at an average rate of 3.86 percent, compared to the rest of the Top 100, which grew at a rate of 4.74 percent thanks to some major merger activity last year.

Below, you’ll find a list of the Top 10 largest law firms in the country by headcount:

1. Kirkland: 2,116 U.S. attorneys
2. Latham: 1,788 U.S. attorneys
3. Greenberg Traurig: 1,750 U.S. attorneys
4. Morgan Lewis: 1,712 U.S. attorneys
5. Jones Day: 1,687 U.S. attorneys
6. Sidley Austin: 1,661 U.S. attorneys
7. DLA Piper: 1,505 U.S. attorneys
8. Skadden: 1,456 U.S. attorneys
9. Lewis Brisbois: 1,308 U.S. attorneys
10. Holland & Knight: 1,232 U.S. attorneys

# New York Is Where It's At For Biglaw

New York City (Photo by David Lat)

The biggest and the best New York Biglaw firms are out-performing the industry average. Based on 2023 data collected by ALM, we’ve learned not only have elite New York firms rebounded the sluggish 2022 but they’re kicking ass compared with the rest of the country.

Patrick Smith at Law.com [looked at the performance](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/04/08/elite-new-york-law-firms-outperformed-market-as-firms-invested-in-both-equity-nonequity-tiers/) of 19 elite New York firms, and the results are remarkable. In almost every category they kicked butt —  year-over-year revenue was up on average of 7.4%, revenue per lawyer rose 4.5% in this group, profits per equity partner saw a rise of 8.8%, and net income was up by 10.1%.

While the overall numbers were up in these major categories, you get more differentiation when you break the numbers out by firm.

Indeed, there’s a wide disparity among New York firms’ performances. For instance, based on American Lawyer data, changes ranged from Shearman’s 7.7% revenue fall to Milbank’s 17.8% revenue growth. On the profits side, net income changes ranged from Debevoise & Plimpton’s -8.2% drop to Cravath’s 22.5% jump.

So who were the winners and losers? In revenue growth:

Among the 19, 16 saw revenue growth, led by Milbank (17.8%), Cravath Swaine & Moore (15.8%) and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (15%). The three with revenue falls include Shearman, Cahill Gordon & Reindel (-2.9%) and Proskauer Rose (-0.7%).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

There was also a divide at the revenue per lawyer metric: “The top three firms for RPL growth were Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (20.6%), Shearman (13.1%) and Cravath (11.8%), while the sharpest declines in RPL were seen at Proskauer (-6.5%), Debevoise & Plimpton (-2.9%) and Cahill (-2.1%).”

And along other categories as well:

On the PEP side, Cravath led the charge (up 29.1% to $6.05 million), followed by a tie between Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson (up 20.9% to $4.355 million) and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett (up 20.9% to $6.43 milion). The largest drops in average PEP among the 19 were seen at Cadwalader (-9.6% to $2.78 million); Debevoise (-8.5 to $4.04 million); and Schulte (-7.7% to $3.34 million).

Net income growth was some more of the same, with Cravath leading percentage-wise, (22.5%), followed by Simpson Thacher (20.3%) and Milbank (20%).

Overall attorney headcount growth percentage saw a tie at the top, with both Milbank and Willkie, Farr & Gallagher seeing 7.6% growth year over year. Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett was third with 6.8% growth. Shearman, facing a merger with Allen & Overy next month, saw the largest headcount drop in 2023, down by 18.4%, followed by Wachtell, down by 4.6%.

Despite these differences, as a group, the elite of NY Biglaw did better than the rest. As Gretta Rusanow, managing director and head of Law Firm Advisory Services, Law Firm Group at Citi, noted, they ”outperformed on demand and productivity,” had “higher than industry average revenue growth” and “better expense management.”

So, yeah, New York is King of Biglaw.

# The New Mantra For Lawyers: Don’t Rely On AI
## Remember when Dave Bowman couldn't get the HAL-9000 to open the pod bay doors? Yeah.

There’s so much going on with AI right now that it’s hard to know which way to turn. Now that the [kerfuffle with Open AI’s CEO Sam Altman](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/24/1215015362/chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-fired-explained) appears to have simmered down, what’s next? Is that a question that we should ask ChatGPT? That’s what I did.

Here’s its verbatim response:

I don’t have real-time information, and my training only includes data up to January 2022, so I can’t provide updates on specific events or developments that may have occurred after that date. As of my last update, I don’t have information on future events, including the future activities or decisions of OpenAI and its board of directors.

For the latest and most accurate information, I recommend checking recent news articles, official announcements from OpenAI, or their official website. Keep in mind that the future actions of organizations can be influenced by various factors, and predicting specific outcomes can be challenging.

All righty, then. Note that ChatGPT right now only includes data up to January 2022. Thus, you are out of luck finding the most recent cases on your topic. Arrrggghhhh! Does that mean that you must Shepardize? (I know, an archaic, dinosaur term.)

It’s hard enough for a lawyer’s ego when he loses a case to another lawyer or law firm. But what about when a [law firm loses a case to an entity](https://www.lawnext.com/2023/11/in-case-of-real-lawyers-against-a-robot-lawyer-federal-court-dismisses-law-firms-suit-against-donotpay-for-unauthorized-law-practice.html), that is, a robot law firm not authorized to practice law? Ouch! That’s the fate that befell an Illinois law firm that sued DoNotPay alleging “false association and false advertising under the federal Lanham Act and Illinois state law.” Since even a robot law firm knows that “only a fool has himself for a lawyer,” DoNotPay hired real live counsel. DoNotPay human lawyers succeeded in getting the case dismissed.

Have you ever heard the term “[social loafing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mlfn5n-E2WE)?” It doesn’t refer to laziness on social media, but to another kind of laziness, the willingness to let AI do the heavy lifting, while kicking back. The issue is whether it makes us more efficient and our lives easier, or whether it makes us slackers, and for lawyers as well as for other professionals, that is not a good thing.

We’ve already [seen lawyers sanctioned](https://www.reuters.com/legal/new-york-lawyers-sanctioned-using-fake-chatgpt-cases-legal-brief-2023-06-22/) for reliance (to their detriment) on AI for brief writing. What’s next? When there’s a human and a robot working in tandem, [guess who does the work](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/does-working-with-robots-make-humans-slack-off/ar-AA1kmUYa)?  According to a Wall Street Journal article:

A study published in October in the journal Frontiers in Robotics and AI has an answer: A person who works alongside a robot is less likely to focus on details than when he or she works alone. Anyone who has worked in a team knows that one or two people usually carry the load while the others sit back and watch; researchers call this ‘social loafing.’ It turns out that people treat robots the same way.

Remember how the Rules of Professional Conduct require lawyers to take responsibility for any screw-ups and not blame snafus on staff? What’s the likelihood that lawyers will start blaming the robots? And how do you think judges will react? If it’s anything like that now notorious case where ChatGPT created cases out of whole cloth, [it will not go well](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/nyregion/lawyer-chatgpt-sanctions.html). What’s the moral here? Don’t rely on AI for finished and correct work product. How about this for a slogan? “Don’t rely on AI?” Catchy and it rhymes.

State bars are starting to think about the various ramifications of AI for legal practice. [Florida is warning its lawyers](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ai-tools-pose-risks-to-client-data-florida-bar-warns-lawyers) that they must tell clients when they use and bill for AI and that the lawyers are responsible for reviewing AI work product. But that’s not all. Client confidentiality is a huge concern, along with oversight, advertising, legal fees, and costs.

The Florida Bar’s Board Review Committee on Professional Ethics has issued for comment a [proposed advisory opinion](https://www.floridabar.org/the-florida-bar-news/proposed-advisory-opinion-24-1-regarding-lawyers-use-of-generative-artificial-intelligence-official-notice/) on all the ways in which AI impacts the practice of law and the ethical obligations that arise from its use. This is just the first, but certainly not the last, of various state bars weighing in on the issues.

And not to be outdone, [California has published a report](https://www.govops.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/11/GenAI-EO-1-Report_FINAL.pdf) on the rewards and risks of Generative AI in the public sector. What’s the difference between plain old vanilla AI and Generative AI? Here’s an explanation from the report for the dinosaurs among us:

GenAI builds on advances in conventional AI and uses very large quantities of data to output unique written, audio, and/or visual content in response to freeform text requests from its users and programmers. GenAI tools have the capacity to produce entirely new content instead of simply regurgitating inputted data. Unlike conventional AI systems designed for specific tasks, GenAI models are designed to be flexible and multifunctional. GenAI products are already available as standalone applications such as ChatGPT, Dall-E, and Bard.

Look at the helpful list of citations/references at the report’s end!

And last, but certainly not least, the Fifth Circuit is considering a rule that will [require lawyers to certify use of AI](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/lawyers-must-certify-ai-review-under-fifth-circuit-proposal?source=newsletter&item=read-text&region=digest). Rule 11 sanctions lurking? The court would be the first in the nation to require certification, but I can’t believe that other circuits won’t be far behind. Remember: you sign the pleading; you certify its accuracy and authenticity. I don’t think it’s gotten to the state of “use AI, go to jail,” but that might not be as far-fetched as it seems, so keep your Monopoly “Get Out of Jail Free” cards nearby.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# With Corporate Work In Limbo, Associates Encouraged To Focus On Training Instead Of Billables

Now is the time to be creatively proactive to move your career along. That is the sentiment from management.

— An anonymous Cooley associate, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2022/10/04/rising-client-expectations-escalate-pressure-on-law-firms/), on how corporate work had “hit a lull” at the firm, such that associates have reportedly been encouraged to work on training and development opportunities in lieu of billables. The unnamed associate, who billed 2400 hours last year, and is on track to hit 1900 this year, said colleagues are worried about the prospect of layoffs. Cooley has reportedly instituted a [hiring freeze](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/hiring-freezes-and-stealth-layoffs-hit-top-50-biglaw-firms/).

# Remote Research? No Problem – Meet PLI PLUS
## From the way you meet clients to the way you do research, everything’s more virtual in today’s pandemic climate. Practising Law Institute (PLI), known as the industry’s established provider of continuing legal education, also provides authoritative, practical guidance in an online format that makes finding information easy – even if your ‘office’ is in your dining room.

Alexa Robertson, PLI’s Senior Director of Legal Information Services, answers some questions about PLI’s publishing offerings, including PLI PLUS, PLI’s online legal research system.

Many lawyers will know PLI for CLE. How would you describe PLI Press and the PLUS platform to those unfamiliar with this side of your organization?

As a nonprofit learning organization, we’re dedicated to keeping attorneys and professionals at the forefront of knowledge and expertise – this includes not only CLE and other training programs, but publications as well. [PLI PLUS](http://bit.ly/3hb1RiJ) is our legal research database. We make all our publications available, so you have the benefit of finding answers in any of our renowned treatises, journals, or program course handbooks and transcripts. Subscribers to PLI PLUS have unlimited access to all PLI publications and course materials.

What makes your offering stand out in the crowded marketplace of research and ideas?

It is often said in legal publishing that “content is king.” For us, that is especially true. Our authors are experienced thought leaders who provide detailed and practical materials.

For example, we’ve been told that while there are other titles on regulation of broker-dealers, only the PLI treatise Broker-Dealer Regulation by Clifford Kirsch has a chapter that walks you through the FINRA registration process. These types of elements underscore the practicality of our titles, which can be guides that help you in your day-to-day practice. You can find these standout insights across our titles, including The Corporate Tax Practice Series, Sack on Defamation, and Kane on Trademark Law: A Practitioner’s Guide. A PLI treatise is a comprehensive resource.

What makes PLI PLUS especially useful is that it offers the complete library of these resources, so you can easily find the answers you’re looking for. And though it is a robust database covering 25 practice areas, we’re committed to making it as easy to use as possible so our customers can focus on the content, not the platform itself. For example, we call out the legal forms and checklists in our titles and allow you to download them to Word so they are easy to use. And with the “My Preferences” feature, users can customize the database settings to suit their needs.

What changes have you seen as a result of the pandemic?

When the legal world quite abruptly moved to remote work in March, we saw the effects right away; there was no one in their offices to receive our books. We immediately provided PLI PLUS access to print subscribers as a stopgap measure, because attorneys and law schools across the country were shifting to remote work and remote learning. Throughout the summer and fall, we saw a large number of our print subscribers opt for electronic access through PLI PLUS. We hear people talk about the “new normal” and an increasing preference for resources that cater to remote work – that is something we will continue to respond to as we look ahead to the post-pandemic world.

How can non-subscribers benefit from PLUS?

Even if you don’t subscribe, we make some content freely available. The PLI [Chronicle](http://bit.ly/2WFtc3a) is our newest publication, aimed at giving voice to the diverse array of professionals working in the legal industry. It features concise articles contributed by legal scholars, practitioners and other experts on a range of timely topics that are practice-specific (such as renewable energy, SEC policy, copyright law, and pro bono advocacy) as well as relevant to the profession (such as negotiation skills, well-being in law firms, and remote work policies).

We also offer the[ Journal](http://bit.ly/3rm5W8t), which is an essential resource for timely, in-depth and authoritative analysis of topics impacting the law and the legal profession. Articles in this publication are more heavily researched, with footnote citations to relevant case laws and statutes, as well as links to interesting articles for further reading.

Looking ahead, what enhancements does PLUS have planned for the coming year?

Our enhancements come directly from customer requests we receive throughout the year – we have an ongoing dialogue with our customers that we find very beneficial. Next year we are focusing on integration between our programs and publication products, in response to our customers’ desire for easy access across all formats. We also plan to modernize the PLUS interface so that it is more in line with the main PLI website. We’re looking forward to working with our customers throughout the year to ensure we’re developing an enhanced site that meets their needs.

[](http://bit.ly/3nI2yCJ)Practising Law Institute is a nonprofit learning organization dedicated to keeping attorneys and other professionals at the forefront of knowledge and expertise. PLI is chartered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York and was founded in 1933 by Harold P. Seligson. The organization provides the highest quality, accredited, continuing legal and professional education programs in a variety of formats which are delivered by more than 4,000 volunteer faculty including prominent lawyers, judges, investment bankers, accountants, corporate counsel, and U.S. and international government regulators. PLI publishes a comprehensive library of Treatises, Course Handbooks, Answer Books and Journals also available through the PLI PLUS online platform. The essence of PLI’s mission is its commitment to the pro bono community. View PLI’s upcoming live webcasts [here](http://bit.ly/3nI2yCJ).

# Large Firm Unexpectedly Closes Its Doors, Leaves Nearly 700 Jobless
## This is a complete catastrophe. Which firm just left hundreds of lawyers and clients in the lurch?

Law firms come and law firms go, but if they go suddenly and unexpectedly, they leave complete catastrophes in their wake. Lawyers and staff members will find themselves out of work overnight, and thousands of case files will be left in limbo. A law firm’s closure is never a pretty situation, and unfortunately, hundreds of attorneys and legal professionals are currently experiencing the horror that goes hand-in-hand with a a firm’s failure.

As we [mentioned](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/morning-docket-05-20-15/) previously, [Butler & Hosch](http://www.butlerandhosch.com/), one of the country’s largest foreclosure firms, abruptly closed up shop late last week, leaving all of its employees, not to mention its clients, totally in the lurch. The firm broke news of its impending doom with a surprise 5 p.m. call from its wind-down attorney and an after-hours email from its CEO and senior partner, who announced that he’d resigned from his positions, effective immediately.

Unlike some of the recent law firm failures we’ve covered (see, e.g., Dewey and Bingham), it doesn’t look like compensation guarantees played a role in the decimation of Butler & Hosch. Instead, it seems that through a series of acquisitions and mergers, the firm grew much too large, much too quickly. [Bob Hosch](http://www.butlerandhosch.com/index.php/attorneys/robert-h-hosch-jr/), the firm’s former head honcho, detailed exactly what happened in his firmwide email (available in full on the next page):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Beginning in 2013, for the first time, BH made the decision to grow, not from within, but with strategic acquisitions of members of its competitive set. Market conditions presented several attractive suitors. The first such acquisition involved a competitor in distress, which was acquired out of a Delaware bankruptcy case. This strategic acquisition resulted in the integration of several platforms, including Cal-Western Reconveyance in Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, as well as RTS Pacific in Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.

The last strategic acquisition presented the most exciting opportunity and BH’s biggest challenge: a merger of equals. Following its closing on February 1, 2015, BH now had a national footprint spanning 27 States and the District of Columbia.

As a direct result of the latest merger, BH was (i) actively prosecuting 50,000 to 60,000 foreclosure files at any given moment, (ii) employed nearly 700 attorneys, paralegals and back office staff, and (iii) had access to 90% of the foreclosure industry in the United States.

Having a presence in 27 states and D.C. wasn’t enough for the Florida-based firm, which already had offices in Orlando, Miami, and Tampa. Butler & Hosch also felt the need to open offices in Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. In addition, many of the firm’s files had been picked up from former Florida foreclosure kingpin David J. Stern (who was forced to abdicate his throne when his firm closed thanks in part to its participation in the [great robo-signing scandal of 2011](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/03/is-the-florida-foreclosure-king-abdicating-david-j-stern-will-close-his-law-firm/)).

Here’s what Bob Hosch had to say about his firm’s downfall: “The challenge was to integrate the merger of equals while spurring growth in a declining market environment in our industry. BH failed to meet this challenge and I too share in that failure. I am sorry. Thank you again for your past support and loyalty to BH during its nearly 35 year legacy.”

Sorry, Bob, but your plaintive apologies aren’t going to help the hundreds of legal professionals who have been left without work thanks to your tireless efforts to control the foreclosure market. We’d say that Butler & Hosch could expect a WARN Act lawsuit in its future because the firm didn’t provide the appropriate 60-day notice prior to laying off its entire workforce, but in this case, according to Roy Kobert of GrayRobinson, the firm’s wind-down attorney, no one was being laid off — the firm was merely unable to make payroll. That’s a very creative legal argument there, Roy. Per Julie Kay’s report from the [Daily Business Review](http://www.dailybusinessreview.com/id=1202726745592/Foreclosure-Firm-Butler-amp-Hosch-Shuts-Down?slreturn=20150420092708), as could be expected, Korbert had no comment as to whether Butler & Hosch had actually violated the WARN Act. Here’s more from the DBR:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The law provides exceptions for “unforeseeable business circumstances,” which may apply to Butler & Hosch, according to labor and employment lawyer Brian Lerner of Kim Vaughan Lerner of Fort Lauderdale.

“That’s a heavy burden to meet,” he said. “This is one where I suspect employees would line up for a class action. Everyone is affected by the same issue.”

The firm’s millions of dollars in debt to creditors and potential WARN Act liabilities to its former employees are just the beginning of its future woes. What’s going to happen to the thousands of cases that are now sitting in dockets across the country without attorneys to litigate them? According to our tipsters, there’s “no clear plan to cover court [appearances] and foreclosure cases [are] already getting dismissed because of it.” For the time being, foreclosure defendants who are underwater on their mortgages can breathe a sigh of relief, but we imagine it won’t be long until other foreclosure firms take over those cases.

In the meantime, a website that’s still very much under construction with very little information for Butler & Hosch’s vendors, creditors, and employees has been set up at [http://www.bandhassignee.com/](http://www.bandhassignee.com/). We wish the hundreds of lawyers and legal professionals affected at Butler & Hosch the best of luck while they seek new jobs.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs or stealth layoffs or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive — we’ll never ignore you.

# A Delayed And Incomplete Pay Raise -- But Associates Seem Happy, Actually
## When it comes to compensation, it's all about managing expectations.

The partners at [Holland & Knight](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/holland-knight/) must be a little… annoyed. In late March, H&K got some positive press in these pages for [raising associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-a-biglaw-firm-moves-closer-to-market/). But two months later, [Cravath showed up](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) and took NY (and [everywhere else](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/)) to $180K, making Holland & Knight associates once again below market (and [not happy about it](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/days-go-by-and-associates-keep-getting-angrier/)).

So this morning, managing partner [Steven Sonberg](https://www.hklaw.com/Steven-Sonberg/) sent out a memo to all associates announcing another pay raise. Here’s the key info (full memo on the next page):

[T]he firm will increase Level 1 associate salaries in the Boston, Stamford, New York, Mid-Atlantic, Chicago, Dallas, and California offices to $180,000. The Level 1 salaries in the South Florida offices will increase to $160,000. The Level 1 salary in Atlanta will increase to $155,000.

The firm will make corresponding adjustments to the current Level 1 salaries in its other offices based on market conditions. The Level 2 salaries in all markets will also be adjusted based on specific market conditions. In addition, the salary ranges applicable to more senior associates in all markets will be increased. All of these adjustments will be announced by August 1, 2016.

The salary of each upper-level associate will be determined under the same criteria used in the past. These determinations will be communicated to individual associates by the end of the first week of September.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As you may recall from [prior coverage](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-a-biglaw-firm-moves-closer-to-market/), “Level 1” and “Level 2” associates are first- and second-year associates in H&K-speak, and they are paid on a lockstep basis. More-senior associates get individualized salaries that are within what the firm calls “market range.” The new salaries will take effect on October 1.

With a fairly late implementation date (October instead of July), and with third-year associates and up getting mystery meat in their payday sandwiches (as opposed to the [full market/Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/)), you might expect H&K associates to be unhappy. But they’re not — at least not the ones we’ve heard from. For example:

We feel happy because we really expected HK to forgo a raise altogether, since they [just raised us](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-a-biglaw-firm-moves-closer-to-market/?rf=1) from $145K to $160K (long overdue). Things were looking bleak. Honestly, without [pressure from you all](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/days-go-by-and-associates-keep-getting-angrier/), doubtful this would have happened at all, so thank you.

The recruiters wouldn’t stop calling a handful of us. Once it was shown on the site that many of the other firms electing not to raise to $180K were bringing in far less than HK, that was tough to swallow. A lot of us have friends at other Biglaw firms and they would commonly tease us: “Wow, HK was at market for a whopping month.”

So we are pleased to be on the level of many others. Honestly, besides the compensation issues prior to today, the firm itself has been a pleasure to work for.

Note that Holland & Knight has an impressive [A-minus grade](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/holland-knight/) in the ATL Insider Survey, despite paying a bit below market for a number of years. As we’ve said before, [money isn’t everything](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/biglaw-its-not-all-about-the-benjamins/) when it comes to a satisfying legal career. (We just happen to focus on money because lawyers like metrics, and pay is easier to measure and to compare than, say, subjective satisfaction.)

# Is Biglaw In For A Big Reckoning?

What if it were possible to have a career where you moved seamlessly from work to life and back to work again, all while living in integrity with who you are? What would it be like to be fully engaged while at work, while being keenly present at home, all without worrying about the “hit” your career might take? If you had this life, how would your health, work, and relationships evolve?

Unfortunately, at this current moment in time, our world does not support this vision … yet. But it’s changing. LeanIn.org and McKinsey & Company just released their [“2022 Women in the Workforce” report](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/women-in-the-workplace), which showed that “women leaders — already underrepresented in corporate settings — are switching jobs at the highest rate in years, significantly more than men in leadership. They’re ditching their companies for ones with more opportunities, flexibility, and commitment to inclusion.”

I don’t know about you, but I didn’t need this report to tell me what I’ve seen for decades — women in corporate America, including Biglaw, are fed up operating in an entrenched and broken system that has been built by white men. The McKinsey report has the data to back this up.

So, what are we going to do about it?

The McKinsey report includes an excellent roadmap of what companies can do to combat this problem. I want to focus on what you can do to create exactly the life you desire and deserve.

Based on my experience working in Biglaw and coaching women executives, we have three options. First, do nothing. Second, stay and change the DNA of the organization. Or, third, leave and create our own business that leverages, values, promotes, and utilizes the strengths of women.

Maintain The Status Quo

For generations, women have been working in accordance with other peoples’ expectations of how they should behave — and by that I mean white men. Here’s what we have to show for it: Women are [32% more likely](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/11/01/burnout-rates-up-women-middle-managers/10655108002/) to experience burnout compared to men and [twice as likely](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression/art-20047725) to be diagnosed with depression. [The leading cause of death for women is heart disease, 45% of women aged 20 and over have hypertension, and 41% are obese.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/womens-health.htm) And despite making up 45% of entering associate ranks, [women only comprise 18% to 31% of partnership roles.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/female-representation-in-biglaw-partnerships-a-long-way-to-go/)

Anecdotally, here’s what I hear from my clients.

“I’ve lost my joy.”
“My health is suffering.”
“The money isn’t worth it.”
“I’m falling deeper into the crevices, and I can’t pull myself out.”
“I don’t have the same level of ambition as I did early in my career, and I hate myself for it.”
“I can’t ‘cut it’ and feel like a failure.”
“I’m ashamed.”

If we do nothing, at best, many of us are in a state of [languishing](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html), where we aren’t depressed but we’re not flourishing either. At worst, we are killing ourselves physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

Change The DNA

With the accelerated flight of women from traditional corporate settings and Gen Z’s refusal to participate in toxic and dysfunctional cultures, now is the time to influence real change within our current organizations.

Here are three ways we can do this.

- Practice Conscious Leadership. Conscious leadership first involves guiding others with full awareness of self. It includes promoting innovation and change by having a deep understanding of the ecosystem and individuals within that system. It’s an inclusive focused strategy versus an ego-centered approach. Avoid self-judgment. Show courageous decision-making. Use intuition and logic. Empower your team. Practice active listening. 
- Advocate for Fierce Congruence. One reason women lawyers are suffering is because they’ve moved so far away from what’s important to them. When we feel the pressure of things we have to do or act out of fear, our brain biology changes and stress hormones are released. The model of [congruent leadership](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2022/04/29/congruent-leadership-is-authentic-leadership/?sh=1083ecd24110) is one where the “activities, actions, and deeds of the leader are matched by and driven by a leader’s values and beliefs.” This type of leadership is executed with ease and less stress. Don’t compromise. Consistently act in alignment with your values. Hold others to the same standards as you hold yourself. Be transparent. Model the healthy behaviors.
- Show Up in Love. Yep, you read that right. [“The key [to] leading with love is to nurture a culture where people feel safe enough to be vulnerable.”](https://www.thnk.org/blog/leading-with-love/) This can be difficult in Biglaw, but “[research shows](https://hbr.org/2014/01/employees-who-feel-love-perform-better?referral=03758&cm_vc=rr_item_page.top_right) that people who work in a culture where they feel free to express affection, tenderness, care, and compassion for one another were more satisfied with their jobs, committed to the organization, and accountable for their performance.” Express kindness, empathy, and genuine appreciation for your colleagues and leaders. Build connections with those who are different from you. Communicate your own fears and failures.
Leave And Create A New Economy

If staying feels too onerous, like an uphill battle that will take generations, then leave and create a business that’s fueled by your values, without having to give up income, ambition, or family relationships.

I know this sounds scary and unrealistic, especially for the typical risk-averse attorney, and there are endless objections. But what’s the price of not taking action?

Here’s how to get started.

- Create White Space. Find a space free of noise, distraction, tech, clutter, kids, etc. Sit quietly. Start with 10 minutes every day and work up to an hour or more. Do this regularly. [White space](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2019/09/27/why-senior-leaders-need-white-space-in-their-calendars-and-how-to-make-it-happen/?sh=47d178ab46b3) allows you to decompress and access your higher cognitive functions, including creativity. During this time, ask yourself: What would be your biggest regret if this were your last day on this planet? What would you stop doing right now? How would you like your life to be different a year from now? What is one step you can take toward that goal?
- Believe in the Possible. Attorneys are increasingly creating their own ways of using their degrees. Reach out to them for inspiration and ideas. Do not engage with people who tell you that you cannot do this. Hire a coach who will hold up a mirror to your soul; tell you the truth when you don’t want to hear it but know you need it; keep you accountable; and help you see, realize, and execute the possibility of who you were put on this earth to be.
- Take Fast Action. Attorneys are notorious overthinkers, especially when it comes to making radical moves. We already know the answer yet keep churning the question over in our brains. Our logic prevents us from recognizing the truth and doing something about it, and instead we talk ourselves out of what we feel called to do. The antidote to that is to make a move, right now. DON’T THINK. And watch the power of you accelerate exponentially.
Women lawyers are in a pivotal moment of power. What would Biglaw look like if we chose to change the DNA or simply left?

Let’s take inspiration from our corporate counterparts and the Great Break-Up and say, “no, thank you” (or something stronger) to the white-shoe law firm of yore.

It’s time to take back what we’ve allowed others to control. Will you join me?

# Remote Work May Make It Harder To Train Associates
## Something is lost when attorneys work virtually on a regular basis, and law firms should consider how training processes are impacted by remote work.

I recently attended a friend’s birthday party, and since my friend is a lawyer, many of the people who attended the party were attorneys as well. Naturally, many of the lawyers at the birthday party talked about the remote work policies at their offices, since numerous law firms are slowly returning to offices, and this is a topic of discussion among many legal professionals. As someone who has been self-employed for over three years now, I inquired as to why law firms would be so intent on returning to offices since remote work has been happening pretty seamlessly for years now. One of the lawyers in attendance proffered that one reason why working in an office is preferable to many firms is since it is much easier to train associates in person than through virtual means.

This was an interesting perspective that I had not given much thought to before. Most of the people advocating for a return to the office cite in-person collaboration as one of the reasons why working in an office is more preferable than remote work. Some other law firm managers convey that in-person work is important to socialization and creating a culture at a firm. However, I have not really heard about the importance of training associates in person as being one of the motivating reasons for returning to the office.

Some firms do not really invest too much time and resources in their associates. Indeed, some law firms operate under a business model of paying associates low salaries and not caring much if associates leave after spending less than a year at a firm. In addition, many other law firms focus on hiring seasoned attorneys who already have many of the experiences that they need to succeed as an associate at that firm.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
However, many larger law firms invest considerable time and resources in training associates. These firms usually like to hire associates at the beginning of their careers so that the firms can begin the training process early before attorneys get used to how things operate at other firms. Law firms often invest substantial sums on summer programs so that promising law students will forge a connection with a law firm early in their careers so that law firms can get access to legal talent after the students graduate from law school.

The training process at many Biglaw shops can take years. For instance, at the Biglaw firm at which I worked, it would often be six or more years until a lawyer would take a deposition in a case. Before associates took depositions, they would be tasked with increasingly more sophisticated jobs related to depositions, such as writing deposition outlines, case summaries, and the like, and partners would assess this work product and provide advice about this critical part of litigation along the way. This ensured that when a lawyer was finally deemed fit to take a deposition according to the firm’s standards, they would have an assortment of tools in their arsenal to get the best testimony possible from a witness.

It is not always easy to train an associate remotely. Although it is easy to talk to others through remote means, it is not always easy for partners and associates to review documents together remotely, make annotations to materials, and complete other steps that are typically taken during the training process. In addition, people are less likely to be focused on training processes when this is conducted remotely, since people often have other — personal — issues with which they must contend when they work from home and not from the office.

For instance, when I was an associate in Biglaw, I had a dedicated writing mentor who would help me improve my legal research and writing skills. The writing mentor would read many pieces of my work product, and we would have a meeting to discuss the documents and ways that I could improve the work. Sometimes, we would sit in my mentor’s office for hours going over a brief and dissecting how the research and writing could be improved in the future.

Of course, Zoom calls and tracked changes can be used so that these types of exchanges between mentor and mentee can occur remotely, and many firms no doubt have carried out such activities virtually during the pandemic. However, it is easier to refer to work product and to pay attention during such training sessions that are held in person. Moreover, the mentor/mentee bond is important at many firms since it ties associates to their firm and ensures that mentees will remember the tutelage they received when it comes time for them to train the next generation of lawyers.

In the end, I am all for remote work, and I have published many articles extolling remote work throughout the pandemic. However, something is lost when attorneys work virtually on a regular basis and law firms should consider how training processes are impacted by remote work. In-person communication between mentor and mentee is important at many firms, and this might be an important consideration for law firms deciding when to bring lawyers and staff back to offices.

Strap in, it’s going to be a bumpy ride in Biglaw. The trend of Biglaw firms tightening their financial belts in order to survive the economic upheaval surrounding COVID-19 continues, the most recent example comes from the growing Am Law 200 firm of Clark Hill.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/02/more-am-law-200-firms-cut-costs-to-ride-out-economic-downturn/) Law.com, Clark Hill has instituted a potpourri of cost-cutting measures designed to help the firm weather the economic downturn. That includes a pay reduction for attorneys and staff, a freeze on discretionary spending, and revision of certain benefits (Above the Law tipsters say 401k matching is suspended). And, not to bury the lede, but the firm has also instituted furloughs of some employees. Oof.

According to a firm spokesperson:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“We hope that this will be a temporary measure, and anticipate that as we emerge from this period of global health and economic crisis, we will be able to revisit these difficult decisions.”

ATL joins the firm in hoping all this mess across the whole industry is temporary, and the jobs, salary, and benefits lost during COVID-19 rematerialize. But we won’t be holding our breath.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

# Latest In Vanderpump Rules #Scandoval Is The Best Biglaw Advertisement Ever
## The Biglaw partner behind 'Send it to Darrell.'

Even folks who turn their nose up at reality TV have, at this point, have heard about the Vanderpump Rules love triangle. For the uninitiated, Tom Sandoval and Ariana Madix of Vanderpump Rules fame have split, and a relationship between Tom and co-star Raquel Leviss is at the heart of it all. Scandal! — or rather #Scandoval!

And, because it’s reality TV, the co-stars/friends of the one-time couple are deeply involved. Leviss’s attorney apparently sent a letter to several Vanderpump Rules co-stars, including Lala Kent, asking them to delete and not distribute an intimate video of Leviss that is reportedly at the heart of the cheating scandal.

Kent… did not take kindly to getting the legal correspondence when she has an attorney to handle these things. She took to the socials:

“Raquel, tell your little Mickey Mouse lawyer that if he has stuff to send over, he can send things to my lawyer, same with the rest of my friends and cast, all right?”

“I’ve never in my life had a lawyer contact me in my personal email, all right?” Kent continued. “… You have something to send over, you can send it to my lawyer. That’s why we HAVE counsel, ‘kay? I don’t want to deal. I have a life going on. I got a little baby to take care of. I don’t want to see that in the morning. I don’t want to see that ever.”

And then the money line that launched a thousand memes:

“Send it to Darrell!”

This begs the question — who *is* Darrell?

Well, he’s Fox Rothschild partner [Darrell Miller](https://www.foxrothschild.com/darrell-d-miller). The Georgetown University Law Center graduate is the founding chair of the entertainment & sports law practice at the Biglaw firm. And when Kent’s post went viral, Miller was informed by attorneys working for him. And, as he [told Law360](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1584246), he was a little baffled.

“They ran in and said, ‘You’re a meme!'” Miller recalled with a laugh. “I was like, ‘What are you talking about? What is a meme?'”

And it’s been, well, a WILD ride for Miller.

“This has been the most hilarious thing that I’ve ever experienced,” Miller told Law360 Pulse. “And no, this is never something that I’ve been part of in all my 30 years of practice.”

He’s much more comfortable working behind the scenes:

“I’m a worker bee more than I am trying to be visible in pop culture,” he said.

Miller would rather his hard work do the talking, “That’s really my day-to-day — phone calls, deal-making, conversations, crises management. Adding pop culture on top of that is never a good combination.”

“At the core of who I am is just a boring guy who’s always got my head down,” Miller said. “I like to work really, really, really, really hard.”

So back to that viral post… what even happened with that letter Kent received:

“But in the unscripted world where these ladies go back and forth, it’s not uncommon,” he said. “I think they were panicking, trying to cover up something and threaten people not to talk about something that they didn’t want public.”

Miller noted that the attorney who reached out to Kent never did “send it to Darrell.”

“I think that lawyer is terrified,” Miller said. “But Darrell is sending something to that lawyer.”

And *that* is why you hire a Biglaw attorney.

David Lash

Despite the outsized prevalence of pro bono work being done by attorneys from big law firms, the volunteer role of small firms and sole practitioners is, and historically has been, critical to the delivery of legal services to the poor. Statements to the contrary notwithstanding (see [Back In The Race: No Bono — 4 Reasons Why Solo And Small-Firm Lawyers Minimize Pro Bono Work](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/back-in-the-race-no-bono-how-to-increase-pro-bono-participation-without-the-guilt/)), there are many reasons why this is so.

When it is suggested that some attorneys refrain from participating because the areas of need are incompatible with their own breadth of expertise, a critical point is being missed. The most effective pro bono work is both referred to the private bar by experienced legal aid organizations and supervised by expert legal services attorneys. They are specialists, they work regularly with novices, they leverage their skills and background by providing oversight, guidance and mentoring. Combining the willingness of a good lawyer to help and the expertise of legal aid lawyers overwhelmed with cases and desperately in need of assistance, is an effective teaming of skills and resources. Small firm practitioners need not worry about never having handled an eviction defense case or a foster benefits appeal. They will get all the assistance they need and their participation will have a meaningful impact on the lives of the client they volunteer to serve.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It is a fallacy to assume that small firm lawyers are not in a financial position to engage in pro bono work “because every hour spent doing pro bono work is an hour that could have been spent billing existing clients or developing business.” True, small firms and solo practitioners have less ability to share their work responsibilities, juggle their matters, and rely on others than do lawyers in large firms, and that certainly may impact their ready willingness to handle pro bono matters, but that is an incomplete picture. Every attorney finds time to do the things that are most important to them. If they can create time in their busy schedules to work-out or cook healthy meals, they can find at least some time to help indigent clients. Each hour spent is not necessarily an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to a paying client. If it is important enough, lawyers will stay a little later or arrive a little earlier than they otherwise would have. The correlation of hours is highly suspect.

Other than having less money, and perhaps less experience with the legal system, most pro bono clients treat their attorneys as do any other type of client. They do not suck dry the time of their attorneys just because they are not paying for it. Good client intake, with help from an expert legal aid organization, more often than not yields clients who are grateful, who understand they otherwise never would have been able to access the high-quality legal representation they are being given. They are as respectful of time and effort as are commercial clients, no more and no less.

Most commercial clients are proud that their attorneys are engaged in the community and doing meaningful pro bono work. Lawyers proudly, and rightly, market their pro bono successes, often to their commercial clients who, just as often, take note. Clients are rarely resentful that the poor got free services for completely different types of cases while the commercial clients may have paid a hefty fee. Apples generally are not contemptuous of oranges.

Lawyers who provide brief service and advice to cold-call prospective clients who simply cannot afford to hire them indeed are engaged in legitimate pro bono work. Any contrary indication is the result of misunderstanding. Advising low-income would-be clients, and helping them navigate a legal issue or procedure, is a valuable service that when performed by a solo practitioner is every bit the pro bono assistance that a legal aid organization or a big firm would give.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
While IOLTA funding for legal aid organizations across the country has fallen dramatically due to diminished interest rates, a combination of state bars, local governments, philanthropists, and legal aid organizations themselves have launched life-saving campaigns to try to make up for at least some portion of those lost funds. In California, for instance, new filing fees have been tapped for legal aid support, the legislature has been lobbied for more general-fund assistance, educational efforts have increased awareness of the impact and economic advantages of funding legal aid organizations, pilot project funding for the Shriver Civil Right to Counsel Act has been made permanent, campaigns have been launched to ensure that lawyers put their trust accounts in the highest-bearing interest rate banks available, and state bar dues bills have included new opportunities by which the private bar can provide support. Increased foundation fund-raising, and solicitation of more support from both the law firm and local business communities have yielded successes. True, these measures do not make up for the precipitous drop in interest rates, but those who care about the delivery of legal services to the poor have not sat idly by. A call to action is warranted, indeed, but there are platforms already are in place from which additional efforts can grow.

Some lawyers may be concerned about being unable to separate the truly needy who present meritorious cases worthy of attorney time and heart from those who are milking the system. But to allay those concerns, potential pro bono volunteers need look for comfort no further away than their local legal aid organizations. The strength of pro bono volunteers is built directly on the shoulders of our expert, full-time, fully dedicated legal services attorneys whose organizations and knowledge distinguish the fair from the unfair. Lawyers with the desire to fulfill our profession’s highest calling and provide access to justice for the indigent should direct their efforts to working in concert with their local experts. They will find professional intake staff who are skilled at evaluating cases for both pro bono eligibility and substantive merit. They will find lawyers whose job it is to supervise and lend outstanding and long-cultivated knowledge about the particular subject matters at issue. And with greater funding, greater numbers of those experts can be hired, and greater numbers of well-screened, well-supervised pro bono engagements will be the result. Private bar attorneys who do not rely on legal aid groups for pro bono referrals are missing the most effective, efficient and significant opportunities to touch the lives of those in need in the most meaningful of ways.

Finally, regardless of misperceptions and in addition to the pro bono work of major law firm lawyers, who annually contribute collectively as many as 5 million hours of representation of the poor, there are many thousands of lawyers working alone or in small firms who diligently serve indigent clients. They work with legal services lawyers, they do intake, they handle small cases, they team with others to handle larger engagements, they attend clinics, they work through bar programs, they volunteer through their churches, mosques and synagogues, they help low-income friends, and more. In other words, these lawyers are, and always have been, a vital part of the system of delivery of legal services to the poor. They do not minimize pro bono work nor are their pro bono services themselves minimized. They do what they can, they answer the profession’s highest calling, likely in the same numbers and percentages as other attorneys. They are to be thanked.

# Stat Of The Week: The Mysterious 'Elite Retreat' Of Women In Law
## Women graduates of elite law schools seem to be leaving the law earlier than their peers from lower-tier schools.

Conventional wisdom would have us believe that women lawyers step off the Biglaw hamster wheel after just a couple of years in order to have families, [gather in herds](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/good-donald-trump-jr-tweet), and talk about diapers and whatnot. [Research from ALM Intelligence](http://www.law.com/sites/ali/2016/09/15/elite-retreat-do-women-from-top-law-schools-leave-the-law-earlier/?LikelyCookieIssue=true) suggests that this is a false narrative. Rather, the proportion of women in law firms erodes in a gradual and steady manner over time. According the ALM data, women one year out of law school make up 44 percent of the Biglaw population, while women 25 years out compose only 25 percent of the large law firm population.

However, there is an anomalous subgroup: graduates of elite law schools. Women graduates of top schools do have a sudden drop in percentage after the three to five years post-graduation period which women from lower-tiered schools do not. ALM dubs this phenomenon the “Elite Retreat.”

Check out this graph below. (Women from U.S. News Top 10 schools are represented by the orange line):

ALM does not offer a hypothesis for this apparent greater tendency on the part of elite graduates to leave the law earlier.

Day by day and one by one, Biglaw firms have been announcing their assimilation to the $215K-$415K salary scale, which has turned into a must-have for firms that wish to hold onto their cherished designation as members of the law firm “elite.”

Which is the latest Biglaw firm to do so?

Willkie Farr — a firm that brought in $986,000,000 gross revenue in 2020, making it #44 on the Am Law 100 — is raising its salaries yet again. The firm last made a salary move back in February, when it [adopted the Davis Polk salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/willkie-raises-22/) as its own. Now, the firm is matching the prevailing market compensation rate: the Cravath scale. Here’s what that looks like at Willkie:



The new salary scale at Willkie goes into effect on March 31, and will be retroactive to January 1. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Willkie Farr.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# COVID Outbreak Reportedly At Jones Day, But An Insider Says Not Everyone Was Told About It
## Wouldn't you want to know if it happened in your office?

As the second wave of COVID-19 gains steam, this kind of story is only going to become more common.

[According to Jamie Hamilton ](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-covid-outbreak-jones-day-hidden-staff-claims-insider)at Roll On Friday, the London office of Jones Day has experienced an outbreak of COVID-19. And while upsetting for those who are impacted, unfortunately, it isn’t all that surprising. People — and law firms — are itching to get back to normal, but the novel coronavirus has different plans.

But what allegedly happened after the outbreak, reportedly in the corporate and restructuring teams, is turning quite a few heads. Unlike Squire Patton Boggs, which [shut down their entire Manchester office](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-office-shut-down-after-covid-outbreak/) after positive tests, how Jones Day allegedly handled the outbreak leaves quite a bit to be desired. It seems the firm[ took a page from Oklahoma Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/law-school-has-covid-19-mass-exposure-event-tells-only-some-students-about-it/), and was… selective about who in the London office got a heads up about the outbreak. Roll on Friday reports office wide notifications did not go out, and only certain people with direct contact with confirmed cases got the courtesy of a notification:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The US firm “pressured lawyers to come back to office” and “has now had an outbreak”, a source told RollOnFriday.

The positive cases are understood to have sprung up in the corporate and restructuring teams, which have been sent home. But, in a Trump-like move, Jones Day “didn’t tell anyone in the office” about the outbreak except for those who were in direct contact with the infected individuals, said a source.

It means that staff “are blissfully unaware and still coming in, despite lawyers in corporate and restructuring being tested and/or sent home”, said the source.

We’ve reached out to Jones Day for comment and to find out their procedures for dealing with COVID outbreaks, but have yet to hear back.

With so much uncertainty still surrounding the pandemic, you’d think a major international law firm would err on the side of over communication with their employees, especially with health and safety on the line. However, stories like this show what it’s really like on a law firm’s front lines.

Biglaw firms across the country are implementing all manner of initiatives to bring attention to the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion among their ranks. We’ve previously acknowledged [Dorsey & Whitney](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/biglaw-firm-introduces-diversity-hours-that-count-toward-associate-billable-requirements/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/care-about-biglaw-diversity-well-now-you-can-bill-for-it/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/5-concrete-steps-law-firms-can-take-to-advance-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-offer-billable-diversity-hours-for-all-timekeepers/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-25-biglaw-firm-offers-bonus-eligible-diversity-inclusion-billable-hours/), [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-5-biglaw-firm-raises-the-bar-on-billable-diversity-inclusion-hours/), [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-biglaw-firm-offers-associates-100-billables-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), [Locke Lord](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/biglaw-firm-offers-associates-75-billable-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), [Foley Hoag](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firm-offers-associates-unlimited-billable-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), and [K&L Gates](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/top-50-biglaw-firm-offers-associates-50-billable-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/) as firms where approved diversity and inclusion-related work will be billable for attorneys and will count toward bonus thresholds. We just received word that yet another Biglaw firm is making its pledge to increase diversity and inclusion within the legal profession a major priority.

Robinson+Cole — a firm that brought in $130,246,000 gross revenue in 2020 — hopes to make diversity in the workplace a reality with its introduction of several new initiatives, including a diversity hours policy. From the firm’s press release:

Effective January 1, 2021, up to 50 hours per calendar year devoted to approved DE&I activities will count towards the annual billable-hours requirement for all of the firm’s timekeepers. The approved DE&I activities include participation in a diverse affinity bar association or diversity oriented professional organization; mentoring underrepresented lawyers and law students; and attending programs, events and trainings focused on DE&I, among other activities.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
On top of its new diversity hours, the firm is also encouraging employees to use personal pronouns in their email signatures and online bios, and one of its new employee benefits includes access to a breast milk storage and delivery service for nursing mothers who are traveling. The firm has also joined the Law Firm Antiracism Alliance, and plans to participate in large-scale pro bono projects that address systemic racism.

[Rhonda J. Tobin](https://www.rc.com/people/RhondaJTobin.cfm), Robinson+Cole’s managing partner, emphasized that having a diverse workforce was “integral” to the firm’s “core values of collaboration, civility, and inclusion.” Tobin went on to note that the firm is launching these initiatives “in an effort to enhance our culture, promote meaningful engagement in DE&I efforts, and to continue to create an environment of inclusion for all employees.”

Congratulations to Robinson+Cole on its commitment to diversity, and for offering its attorneys a way to create a better workplace. What an admirable way to support diversity and inclusion efforts. What is your firm doing to support DE&I within the legal profession? Please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) to let us know.

Jeff Hammes

If [Kirkland chairman] Jeff Hammes woke up on the wrong side of the bed and wanted to really mess up your firm—maybe even put it out of business—he could do that. And that’s a different dynamic that is starting to emerge in legal and it’s a whole new level of pressure for people running today’s law firms.

— Kent Zimmermann, consultant to law firm managing partners at the Zeughauser Group,[ reflecting](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/10/24/after-baker-mckenzie-chair-takes-leave-for-exhaustion-other-leaders-share-pressures/) on the intense pressure facing the lawyers charged with leading law firms in the[ wake of news](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/global-chair-of-biglaw-firm-taking-temporary-leave-due-to-exhaustion/) that Baker McKenzie’s Global Chair, Paul Rawlinson, is taking temporary medical leave for issues caused by exhaustion.

# Unsolicited Or Inadvertent Communications: As Complex As Litigation Itself
## How should ‘receiving’ attorneys respond?

Attorneys must often navigate the minefield of unsolicited or inadvertent communications. These can be subject to attorney-client privilege, be confidential, or implicate constitutional rights.

To help legal practitioners exercise the proper care, Practising Law Institute offers the on-demand CLE program [Dealing with Unsolicited Receipt of Confidential or Privileged Information: How Should a “Receiving” Attorney Respond?](https://bit.ly/3DyZljA) The following summarizes a few highlights.

How these communications are handled “all depends on context and content, literally,” said David C. Shonka, a partner with Redgrave LLP in Washington, D.C., who formerly served in-house with the Federal Trade Commission. “The ethics rules are not hard and fast, so you should seek additional guidance from the law of your jurisdiction.”

These communications may come from whistleblowers who believe their company is doing something fraudulent. They may come from disgruntled employees or get turned over inadvertently to fulfill a discovery request.

On the Civil Side 

According to Kathleen A. McGee, a partner with Lowenstein Sandler LLP in New York City, if you receive inadvertent communications, “You need to consider the ethics of taking a look at something you have a reasonable suspicion you shouldn’t have received.”

Because of the nature of electronic communications, McGee says, attempts to claw back information are common. States usually have guidance for reaching out to opposing counsel. Of course, receiving attorneys also have an obligation to their clients.

“If you think it’s too prejudicial to your client to not use in some way you can seek some kind of agreement,” McGee explains, advising to ask about ground rules for claw-back provisions at the outset. “If you ask first, you can have more than just an honor system. You can have an agreement.”

On the Criminal Side

In the criminal context, the question is often whether use of the information violates constitutional rights.

Elizabeth Roper — the chief of the Cybercrime and Identity Theft Bureau for the New York County District Attorney’s Office at the time of this program’s recording — places unsolicited information in two buckets: “Either we get it proactively from a witness or whistleblower, or in the cyber context, from a security researcher.”

Such disclosures are deliberate, which leads to the question of whether they constitute private or state action.

The recent case U.S. v. Phillips (9th Cir. Apr. 29, 2022) — one of a few cases discussed in the program — deals with this issue.

In the case, a woman accessed the laptop of her ex-fiancée to show a police detective evidence of child pornography. The detective asked her to show him only images she had already accessed, independently. The court rejected the defense’s efforts to suppress.

The detective in Phillips was careful, but the question becomes, when does a request for more information render something a state action? 

The holding is “consistent with our practices,” says Roper. “When a private citizen does it, it’s not state action and the Fourth Amendment is not triggered. Using it to build the case is appropriate.”

But if law enforcement asks the private citizen to get more, the court is likely to limit its use to the original information, Roper explains.

Inadvertent disclosures are simpler.

“If we had over-production in response to a subpoena,” Roper says, “it might include information beyond the scope, and we have a legal obligation to make sure we don’t use it.”

The Metadata Trap

The seminar also addresses metadata. In discovery, many terabytes of information can be turned over. The metadata could feature someone seeking the advice of an attorney.

“The answer is, don’t turn things over with metadata,” says Ronald J. Hedges, senior counsel with Dentons in New York. “This is more a tech question than anything else. Understand what you’re producing and the form you’re producing it in.”

McGee advises attorneys to make sure they understand their information technology systems. If you don’t, “you could be really putting yourself in a compromised position.”

Shonka says he sees “little excuse these days for people not knowing there is metadata out there.”

Unlike in Biglaw, not everything is a emergency when you’re working in-house.

Ed. note: Please welcome Kay Thrace to our pages. She will be writing about the ins and outs of her role as in-house counsel.

As promised in my introductory column last week, I’m back to wax poetic about transitioning from Biglaw to in-house. You need a few things, mainly (i) a jaw-dropping pay cut, (ii) the best damn poker face this side of Rounders, and (iii) a remedial course on what constitutes an emergency.

Since the first one is depressing and the second one can’t be taught, let us focus our attention on the word “emergency.” According to the Google monster, an emergency is an unforeseen combination of circumstances that calls for immediate action.

When you are a player in the Biglaw matrix, the rationale for why everything is an emergency hinges on the “immediate action” verbiage. If you are charging a client between six and nine hundred bucks an hour, then short of a surgical repair to a vital organ or Hamilton tickets, their emergency trumps whatever you’re doing. Do you think it’s your expert opinion they’re paying for? Of course not. They’re paying for the peace of mind that if something goes sideways, you will find a way to resolve it immediately.

In transitioning to the role of in-house counsel, it took me about six months to recalibrate what constituted an emergency. To a business person, particularly of the sales variety, an emergency ranges from “we need to close this deal tonight or we don’t make our quarterly numbers” to “it’s Tuesday and I don’t want to think about this tomorrow because I have spin class.” And time and time again, as I acclimated, I fell into these three common traps:

EXPIRED MILK: It’s Friday afternoon and you receive an urgent email that requires you to review a 60-page agreement by 5 p.m. Your initial reaction is, how could we not have known about this? And just as you start to sweat and adjust your Friday night takeout plans, you read down the email chain. When did this urgent request arise? Today? Of course not. Yesterday? No way. Chances are that email is at least two weeks ago and your business person has sat on it. Like milk and other perishables, you have to check the date, otherwise you’re going to be drinking bad product. EMERGENCY VERDICT: NOPE NOPE NOPE, OR AT LEAST NOT YOUR EMERGENCY. (Amusing side bar: this slop show practice of forwarding the underlying email is just further proof that your business counterpart would never, in fact, get away with murder. It’s like buying the garbage bags and shovel on a credit card. Who does this?)

EARTH’S LAST HOPE: It’s Tuesday evening, you’re about to turn in, and your cell is buzzing. A business person needs your eyes on something before a mission critical meeting on Wednesday morning. Stop and ask yourself, did I just get pinged by Armageddon Bruce? In case you’re unfamiliar with Armageddon Bruce, he’s your average, unassuming nice guy turned action hero who is brought in as humanity’s last hope to battle the asteroid hurtling toward Earth. The problem with Armageddon Bruce is you root for him as he brings you his tales of woe and urgency and if you could just help him out on this one thing, a crisis will be averted. And you do this thing for Bruce because you want to save your company from a crisis, right? The problem with Armageddon Bruce is that every crisis is an extinction event as opposed to a piece of siding that fell off the space shuttle and is fluttering toward an uninhabited island and the stupid thing will burn up before it enters Earth’s atmosphere. Armageddon Bruce isn’t a hero. He’s got a good soundtrack but he’s got no sense of scope, which is why when he calls you late night (again) begging you to look at this NDA for some outlandish startup your company would never work with anyway, you should just go back to bed with a clear and untroubled conscience. EMERGENCY VERDICT: PFFFFTTTTT, THIS IS A POORLY MADE FLICK THAT YOU WOULDN’T BE CAUGHT DEAD WATCHING FOR FREE ON AN INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT.

DICKENSIAN DILEMMA. Top brass has impressed upon you that if this deliverable isn’t done by a certain time there will be dire (ill-defined) consequences because you held up the process. So you draft like a monkey on crank and get that term sheet out by midnight and … nothing. You might refresh your email, and when that doesn’t work, you’ll check your internet connection just to make certain your portal is working. You’ll go to bed with that uneasy feeling that you’ll wake to 60 unread emails in your inbox. Nothing. You’ll walk the halls of your office like Will Smith in I am Legend waiting for a term sheet-starved zombie team to pounce, and when that fails, you’ll tempt fate and leave your office door wide open. Crickets. By now you feel like you’ve stumbled upon the lost colony of Roanoke two weeks after everyone left town. Dear reader, have you realized your fatal mistake yet? It’s the day before a long weekend. Or a major holiday. Or a boondoggle in Vegas. Or any date between July 1 and August 31 where the SVP is now in Italy sipping bubbles on his lavishly appointed yacht. You didn’t get the memo? The fire drill was just for you so that the SVP could move it off his plate and onto yours before some magical undisclosed date and time. He was never going to read that deal document at midnight. People have lives after all, right? It can now wait since no one is in the office. EMERGENCY VERDICT: PLEASE. YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER. THE JOKE IS ON YOU, BOB CRATCHIT.

Once I learned to avoid these traps and focus on the correlation between (i) and (iii), I adjusted my worldview. I took a whopper of a pay cut to go in-house for the promise of a better work-life integration model. That means the definition of what an emergency is has to shift or I continue to work Biglaw hours for in-house money (and while I’m bad at math, I’m not that bad at math).

Occasionally, I’ll encounter an actual unforeseen legal emergency. The difference of whether or not it needs immediate attention is decided by me as the attorney (and only adult in the room). Or I’ll get an immediate action order from someone I can’t turn down. By my calculations, I have enough clout and tenure that there are only about seven people in the company who I can’t say no to at this point. I like those odds. And in any event, it beats sitting around waiting to get smote by an asteroid.

The New York legal market is making its way to a base salary of $180,000 for first-year associates as the standard. We’ve waited nine-plus years for a move on salary, and now that it’s here there is much joy and excitement, but also speculation. For example, we keep hearing Kirkland & Ellis is [going to match](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202759474944?__nored=2), but, as of yet, we haven’t seen the memo.

But there is also the flip side: what associates won’t be seeing a bigger payday? When the news first broke, there was immediate chatter that this firm was too cheap to match or that one was [too highly leveraged](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-an-addendum-on-leverage/) to match. As of publication time, only a [handful of Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/), and a pair of boutiques, have gotten on board with the program — and now we are hearing some firms definitely will not be playing ball.

[American Lawyer broke](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202759474944/Big-Firms-Move-to-Match-Cravath-Associate-Pay-Boost) the bad news to associates at [Kelley Drye](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/kelley-drye/), whose initial plans seem to be prioritizing clients’ money concerns:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“With [Monday’s] announcement some big law firms demonstrate that they do not listen to what their clients have been saying over the past decade about the price of legal services,” said Kelley Drye & Warren chair James Carr, who assumed leadership of his firm last year. “While we continue to monitor the compensation market, in our view, sophisticated purchasers realize that they can obtain equal or better legal services at Kelley Drye for a fraction of the cost.”

We have also heard from a partner at an Am Law and Vault 100 firm not headquartered in New York who said no way would their firm be matching. And highly placed sources at other firms have speculated that junior partners at some sizable firms make less than the top of the Cravath scale, so they won’t be playing the matching game either.

With [Weil Gotshal & Manges](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-biglaw-giant-goes-to-180k-for-all-u-s-offices/) and [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-first-major-match/) making the pay raises effective for all U.S. offices, there is also added pressure on non-New York markets to make a move. But that doesn’t mean they are eager to [make the jump](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202759474944/Big-Firms-Move-to-Match-Cravath-Associate-Pay-Boost?slreturn=20160508115356):

The Philadelphia firm leader, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely, added that he continued to be “blown away at the short memories of law firm leaders.” He said it’s possible the high-end legal services industry is heading into another downturn. In that type of climate, he added, firms are raising salaries only to then “chop the heads off their associates.”
…
“We certainly took note,” said Fox Rothschild managing partner Mark Silow of the salary increases. “[But] we don’t view Cravath as one of our competitors. It’s really in a different segment of the market.”

And folks are getting antsy, we got this message from a tipster who feels underappreciated:

Interesting news out of Boies Schiller And Flexner: Silence. Our pay is now significantly below market. Base is below market and bonuses for most associates (even in the 2300-2400 hr range) is less than market, particularly for midlevel associates.

So what about the other firms out there? Do you know of any Biglaw players that are sitting this round out? If so, please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) — when you know of other firms making a compensation move or refusing to do so.

UPDATE (2:21 p.m.): Oof. More bad news. Lesson learned: even if your firm “matches” in New York, you might not be getting a raise. Covington & Burling’s email to associates letting them know the 500+ attorneys in their D.C. office won’t be seeing a compensation bump was brutal. You can read all the details [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-salary-hike-not-all-offices-are-created-equal/?rf=1).

Law firms that adopted the Mansfield Rule in 2017 as part of Diversity Lab’s inaugural certification process have diversified their top ranks at a far faster rate than their non-Mansfield peers, according to data released this week.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Raises, Makes Adjustment To Market Compensation Grid
## Small change? Sure, but still above market.

California-based Biglaw firm Irell & Manella has delighted associates with raises, like so many of their peer firms. With $132,903,000 in gross revenue last year, the firm’s ranked 183rd on the Am Law 200, but they are showing they have the cash to meet — and beat — market compensation.

Effective July 1, this will be the salary scale at Irell:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Eagle-eyed observers will note, rather than the $202,500 for the incoming class of 2021 that Davis Polk led with, Irell has bumped the scale up to $205,000 for the stump year. (Other firms have left the class of 2021 off the grid entirely — probably because they aren’t at the firm yet, hell, they haven’t even taken the bar exam yet — so others may be intending to bump up that class as Irell has done.) It’s not a huge difference, but with so many firms just copying the existing scale, every change matters.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Hope For Fall Special Bonuses Is Fading Fast
## Surprising? No. Disappointing? Yes.

The hope that associates will receive fall special bonuses in recognition of their hard work during the pandemic has nearly been extinguished. It is November, the sun is setting earlier and earlier, and Biglaw’s normal bonus schedule is right around the corner. In that way, Cravath’s [wait-and-see approach](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cravath-is-not-offering-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-pissed/) has become a model for large swaths of Biglaw, despite others like [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/), [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/milbank-bonuses/), and [Latham](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/latham-bonuses/) moving forward with special bonuses. But Cravath is still Cravath, and lots of firms have taken [their lead on fall bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/fried-frank-no-bonuses/?rf=1).

So, it really isn’t a surprise that during a recent town hall, Covington & Burling told associates no fall bonuses are on the way. From a tipster at the firm:

During [Monday’s] town hall with the associates, the Management Committee announced that it will not award any fall bonuses to associates, even though firm has very strong 2020 FY financial results.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
At least the projected strong 2020 financial results bodes well for year-end bonuses that can bring the associates back up to market compensation.

So, Covington attorneys, how do you feel about the bonuses? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

We had a nice acceleration, and to close out a pretty good year, all things considered. It’s as good as the industry has looked since coming into 2022.

What we’ve heard is the drivers of 2023′s growth are still in place. That gives us a base. And the doubling of expectations into 2024 is highly driven by the transactional market.

— Owen Burman, senior consultant and managing director with Wells Fargo’s Legal Specialty Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/01/30/after-moderate-revenue-gains-law-firms-plan-for-growth-in-both-deals-and-litigation/) on the group’s 2023 year-end survey. Wells Fargo found that Biglaw’s revenue growth was up by 6% at the year’s end, up from
4.6% through Q3. In addition, demand was up 0.7% from 0.2%, with standard billing rates at an all-time high of 8.3%.

# How To Get On A Recruiter’s Naughty List (And Why It Matters)

When you’ve been in the recruiting business as long as we have, you notice some behavioral patterns. Some of those patterns are a little, let’s say, irritating. As a public service to the legal recruiting industry, we thought we’d put together a list of what not to do as a law firm or candidate engaging with recruiters.

Assuming you are not yourself a recruiter, why should you care about this? (Other than not wanting to be a terrible person!) Whether you are a law firm leader or a potential lateral candidate, it turns out that treating recruiters respectfully has real benefits for you.

From the firm perspective, it’s important to understand that recruiters don’t prioritize firms equally. Our job is to move lawyers from one firm to another. The reality is that if we aren’t making placements with your firm, we’re looking to move your people to firms that work constructively with us. So from a talent retention perspective, it helps to have a solid relationship with the recruiting community. How recruiters perceive your firm also has an effect on your broader reputation in the market. When we are placing at your firm, we talk to hundreds of candidates, encouraging them to consider joining you. This is a marketing function — it builds a positive perception in the industry. Naturally, being on the recruiter naughty list will have the opposite effect.

From a candidate perspective, there is a good chance you’ll be back on the market at some point in the future — or at least that you’ll be open to considering an especially great opportunity. Having a [relationship with a recruiter](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/why-you-should-build-a-relationship-with-a-recruiter-now/) you trust is beneficial both for learning what’s happening in the market generally and for getting early notice of specific opportunities. Burning your recruiter bridges squanders those potential benefits.

So with that in mind, here’s what you shouldn’t do:

- Refusing to pay: After hiring a candidate, the firm claims it knew of the candidate before the recruiter introduced her, and therefore it doesn’t owe a fee. This tends not to be mentioned until the end of the process, after the recruiter has already shepherded the candidate through.
- Dragging it out: The firm gives the same search to multiple recruiters in succession, without hiring anyone, causing the search to be stale by the time we’re asked to drum up candidates.
- Cutting us out: The candidate learns of an opportunity from a recruiter, then reaches out to the firm directly or via a friend who works there.
- Gaming the clock: After the recruiter submits a candidate, the firm waits exactly six months (when its obligation to pay a fee expires), then reaches out directly to the candidate.
- Below-market fee caps: The firm expresses interest in working with a recruiter but insists on paying only half the market rate.
- Window shopping: The firm takes a meeting with any candidate the recruiter submits, but it never hires any of them.
- Feigned interest: The candidate uses the recruiter to get a competing offer, with the goal of building leverage against their current firm to gain a promotion, a higher salary, or enhanced remote-work flexibility.
- Setting false criteria: The candidate declares they won’t move unless it’s for X amount of money. The recruiter convinces the firm to increase its offer by a six-figure sum, exceeding the candidate’s threshold. The candidate still rejects the offer.
- Inconsistent feedback: The firm rejects a candidate as too junior, days after hiring a candidate of the same seniority level.
- Radio silence: The firm provides zero feedback on a seemingly strong candidate.
- Unrealistic expectations: The firm is exceedingly picky about candidate credentials, despite offering nowhere near market compensation.
- Confidentiality fails: After the recruiter submits a candidate on a confidential basis, the firm carelessly asks around about the candidate, causing the news to get back to the candidate’s current firm.
- Late conflict discovery: Disregarding the best practice of [conducting early conflicts checks](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/why-a-conflicts-check-should-be-step-one-in-a-partners-lateral-move/), the firm discovers an insurmountable conflict near the end of the process.
- Hiding the ball: The candidate fails to tell the recruiter about competing interviews or offers, causing the recruiter not to press the firm to speed up its process, and causing the candidate to miss out on what could have been an offer.
- Ghosting: Candidates, this one is pretty self-explanatory. Whether in the dating market or the job market, ghosting people is a bad look!

# GC Writes The Legal Equivalent Of Maximum Side-Eye In Response To Latest Lawyer For Coach Bob Huggins

Cops pulled over West Virginia University basketball coach Bob Huggins in the Allegheny West area of Pittsburgh last month. He blew a .21 and apparently had a garbage bag in the passenger seat filled with empty beer cans because [he believes in recycling](https://medium.com/@thomhaller_/a-potential-defense-for-bob-huggy-huggins-4d831fbf8554). Soon afterward, the university announced that the Hall of Fame coach had resigned.

Or did he?

That’s the latest wrinkle in the Huggins drama. While the school released a resignation statement from Huggins at the time, he’s now [denying that he ever wrote or even looked at the statement](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/37991587/bob-huggins-says-write-resignation-statement) and says that [his wife sent the resignation without his approval](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/37981764/former-coach-bob-huggins-says-never-resigned-wvu). To that end, his attorney David Campbell of Lewis Brisbois wrote the university asserting that Huggins is still employed under the coach’s agreement with the school.

WVU General Counsel Stephanie Taylor… [disagrees](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/bob-huggins-wvu-lawyer-letter/2/).

Dear Mr. Campbell:

Thank you for your letter confirming that you are in fact representing Mr. Huggins. I will await confirmation from Mr. Huggins’ other counsel on their status in terms of their representation of him, as I noticed that your letter implies that your representation may be limited to this belated request to “return to active coaching duties.”

“Other counsel” is a red flag. While Campbell has challenged the school over the resignation, Huggins has not one but two other attorneys. And those attorneys have spent the last three weeks dealing with the school over the coach’s resignation.

After reading your recent letter, I am still confused by your allegations. Are you asserting that Mr. Huggins never resigned? Is it your position that Mr. Gianola, the longstanding lawyer for Mr. Huggins, engaged with the University on June 17 without the knowledge or authorization of Mr. Huggins? And then Mr. Huggins’ wife submitted his resignation without his knowledge or authorization? Finally, that Mr. Huggins did nothing to rectify this situation for almost three weeks? Or, are you asserting that Mr. Huggins did resign, but his notification did not meet the technical requirements under the Employment Agreement? Are you suggesting that the only way Mr. Huggins could resign would be through registered or certified mail?

Not to diminish the legal import of the Jones Day alum’s response, but this is a brutal paragraph to put in front of sports media covering a high stakes coaching retirement. Each question in this string makes the revocable resignation position appear more laughable. It also does a great job of condensing the otherwise eye-glazing recitation of details over the following pages into a devastating little pull quote for the press.

Either way, the facts prove these positions meritless. I would again encourage you to do appropriate due diligence before asserting a position that is clearly contrary to the documented evidence.

Oof. The only time a lawyer can hold their head high after a scolding for failing to do due diligence is when the lawyer’s high profile [client is stupid enough to waive due diligence entirely](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/twitter-complaint-demonstrates-that-every-lawyer-everywhere-always-is-smarter-than-elon-musk/).

Also, isn’t it a quirky coincidence that Huggins is going to get taken down by two different Taylors? Because we’re not saying the coach was partying in Allegheny West that night because the Taylor Swift concert was kicking off in the nearby stadium, but even if that wasn’t the reason Huggins drove up to Pittsburgh, it’s almost certainly the reason there were a bunch of cops hanging around the area looking for drunk Swifties.

After Mr. Gianola informed the University that Mr. Huggins decided to resign and retire, the University told Mr. Gianola that it needed a writing from Mr. Huggins to that effect. Mr. Gianola specifically asked the University if it would accept Mr. Huggins’ resignation via an email sent by his wife, June Huggins, because (1) Mr. Huggins does not use email, and (2) Mr. Gianola was having IT issues at his firm and could not access his email reliably. Moreover, Mr. Gianola specifically requested the University send language that the University would find acceptable in such a resignation notification. In an effort to accommodate Mr. Huggins, the University agreed to accept the notification from Mrs. Huggins’ email account and to send language we would find acceptable.

Without digging into the particulars of how West Virginia handles implied agency, that seems like WVU could have a lot of confidence in those agents.

As for the “registered or certified mail” issue previewed on the first page, Taylor explains that whatever the notice requirements might hold, they exist for the benefit of the party being notified. And WVU is willing to accept the emailed resignation.

There is no support in the law or on these facts to suggest that Mr. Huggins may now ignore his resignation and his actions upon which all have relied, undo his voluntary separation, and return to work as if none of this ever occurred.

Not to quibble with Taylor, but there is some precedent…


Though I’d suspect this is going to work out for Huggins about as well as it did for George.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# No Really -- *This* Has To Be The Worst Law Of Them All

As lawyers, we’re obliged to uphold the law…. but that doesn’t always mean you agree with it. Attorneys are in a unique position to know the underbelly of the system of laws that govern our society.

So, we want to know, what is *the* worst law?

Perhaps it’s the fact that qualified immunity — the doctrine that lets police get away with pretty much everything — was a [goddamn scrivener’s error](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/police-can-legally-set-you-on-fire-because-someone-in-the-1800s-made-a-copying-error/). And what about the [immunity of the gun industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/the-law-the-needs-to-be-repealed-immediately-to-bring-gun-makers-to-heel/)? That only makes the American gun problem worse. Maybe it’s the[ injustice of the felony murder](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/it-looks-like-sotomayor-is-1-of-3-supreme-court-justices-who-actually-believes-the-whole-do-the-crime-do-the-time-thing/) rule? Speaking of injustice, maybe [mandatory minimums](http://www.atlredline.com/john-oliver-explains-everything-wrong-with-mandatory-mi-1720430046) infuriate you. Let’s not get started on the [dumb immigration laws](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-does-the-doj-prosecute-20000-people-a-year-for-immigration-crimes/). We’ve all witnessed the wild results the [electoral college yields](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/why-is-the-electoral-college-constitutional/). Or maybe you’re annoyed by the simple power grabs like towns putting an [age limit on trick or treating](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/you-are-too-old-to-trick-or-treat-like-by-law/).

# Is Cravath At A Crossroads?
## Partner departures are becoming a regular occurrence at the firm, and that's a little scary for a firm that was once considered untouchable.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

This is a different cycle. And their success or not will depend on whether they can get their partnership to agree that this new way of doing things [partners arriving and leaving with more regularity] is the new North Star for the firm. And that will depend on leadership.

— An anonymous Am Law 100 leader, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/02/02/cravath-enters-modern-era-of-big-law-amid-regular-rate-of-partner-exits/) on the changes that seem to be occurring at Cravath, including but not limited to [partners leaving the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/no-longer-a-rarity-more-partners-leave-cravath-heading-to-rival-new-york-firms/) (which was once unheard of), lateral partner hires being made (which was once a rarity), the and the [creation of a nonequity partner tier](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-cracks-on-non-equity-partnerships/).

It’s an evolution that we’ve really never seen before and it does feel like a boom. It does feel sort of like a race to the moon.

— [Meredith Frank](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/meredith-frank), a Miami-based recruiter for Major Lindsey & Africa, commenting on the [rapid influx of Biglaw firms](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/destination-miami-big-law-follows-the-money-to-south-florida) to the Magic City. Kirkland & Ellis recently announced that the firm would be opening a Miami office, joining the likes of Quinn Emanuel and King & Spalding. Sidley Austin, which hasn’t opened an office there yet, has hired several partners in the city.

# Law Firms Put A Lot Of Eggs In One Basket... And That Basket Is Looking Iffy
## Thomson Reuters unveiled the Q1 Law Firm Financial Index and there are some potentially problematic findings.

Look at all those transactional attorneys!

Law firms racked up big revenue numbers and massive profits throughout the pandemic. With fundamentals still relatively strong and overall demand still up, there are a lot of reasons for firms to remain pleased. Sure, expenses are way up — a combination of associate salary bumps and the return of travel expenses largely absent over the last couple years, but firms are still thriving.

Thomson Reuters put out its latest Law Firm Financial Index (check out the full report by [signing up here](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/lffi-q1-2022-transactional-demand-slows/)) — the artist formerly known as the Peer Monitor Index for folks who’ve followed this for a while. And while the LFFI continues to reflect a market with sound fundamentals, there’s some risk on the horizon.

While demand for most practice areas continued to grow, M&A demand was down 5.7 percent over the last quarter compared with last year. That wouldn’t be as big a development if firms hadn’t spent years putting an increasing amount of their financial eggs in the transactional basket.

“The practice balance has shifted toward transactional over the last several years. Any relative slowdown will have more dramatic impact than in years past,” said William Josten of the Thomson Reuters Institute. That decline isn’t evenly distributed amongst firms. “The 5.7 decline is not to the same extent for top tier firms. It’s being driven by Am Law second 100 and midsized firms.”

Will this hit spill up to the Am Law 100? Is this just a matter of work rebalancing itself or a real economic slowdown? Firms need to be particularly sensitive to this because while there’s still a lot of money to be made in legal services, if firms are carrying a glut of transactional attorneys when the world shifts to litigation there will be some painful conversations.

Putting aside the possibility of being overweighted in the transactional space, things are still looking pretty good for law firms — though don’t expect the soaring profitability figures to continue in the post-COVID environment:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“The first quarter saw strength in demand and rates that would be the envy of almost any pre-pandemic quarter,” said Mike Abbott, head of the Thomson Reuters Institute. “But last year’s sharply reduced overhead expenses provided a significant tailwind that boosted profitability. As those expenses return towards historically normal levels, profitability continues to grow, but at levels nowhere near the outsized gains seen in 2021. The ongoing competition for talent is also contributing to the drag on profits.”

Direct expenses were up 13.1 percent, driven in large part by the merry-go-round of associate raises. Meanwhile overhead was up 9.9 percent with recruiting expenses tied to the hot lateral market contributing to the hike.

And those expense numbers probably haven’t hit their ceiling yet. Josten pointed out that events are still rolling out. “Events are still not back to their top yet so the potential for increase is still there. As things continue to come back to that basis point — events, client meetings — those expenditure categories are going to continue to come back up.”

Will revenue continue to outpace the sharp upturn in expenses? Will there be enough deals to keep the corporate department busy? Not to sour a generally positive report, but those are the questions that will keep law firm leaders up at night for the rest of the year.

# The Price Of A Solo Search
## Here are four assets that a good recruiter will bring to the table.

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

With all the job resources available to attorneys these days, some question the value of using a recruiter. With access to a myriad of job boards and public postings, why should you use a recruiter rather than submitting yourself?

The answer is, it depends on the recruiter. A recruiter’s value depends on the strength of the recruiter and the relationships the recruiter has with potential employers. There are few barriers to entry in the legal recruiting market, so if you don’t first vet the recruiter, you may just be better off doing it yourself.

A good recruiter will bring to the table:

1. Inside Information. They will be familiar with the firms in the market and will share the inside “scoop” – good or bad – so that the attorney can make an informed decision.

2. Unposted Confidential Jobs. A good recruiter should be aware of job openings not widely known in the market place, in addition to those that are public. Firms will often open searches only to select recruiters, because they prefer to rely on a trusted recruiting firm to find them an attorney that fits their specific needs rather than being inundated with résumés from unqualified candidates.

The number of moves by associates in the first quarter illustrates the pervasiveness of unpublished openings. A total of 1341 associates lateraled between Am Law 200 firms during the first quarter, but a public job database listed only 455 jobs for the relevant period. At the same time, Lateral Link’s database included more than 1,700 jobs for Am Law 200 firms, because we are often asked to conduct exclusive and confidential searches. Without this insider knowledge, your best hope is that a self-submitted inquiry happens to align with the firm’s needs.

3. Support. Some attorneys believe they have a contact who can champion their cause at a desired employer. However, that contact is less likely to provide the “back story” for a move, follow up with firm recruiters as necessary, help prepare for interviews, manage the recruiting process, or negotiate an offer.

4. Relationships. Firms receive résumés directly from candidates as well as from recruiters who aren’t known to them – yours might be at the bottom of the stack. Well-established recruiters can leverage their relationships with Recruiting Managers to make sure the candidate’s résumé gets seen.

Without real market intelligence, a lateral search can only answer whether an attorney fits the criteria listed on a vague job description, which may not be perfectly aligned with the firm’s requirements.

Because of our credibility and experiences with the decision makers, we have real-time and authentic understanding of opportunities. You can’t get this intelligence from reading law firm guides.

As intermediaries, recruiters match firms and attorneys by leveraging this uniquely symmetrical and confidential information from both sides – while honoring “privilege” – to pair attorneys and firms together. This arrangement is why recruiters won’t become obsolete anytime soon.

As a recruiting firm, we pride ourselves on our relationships with firms, in-house legal departments, and lawyers. In fact, our team just departed NALP’s (National Association For Law Placement) 2016 Education Conference in Boston. We also hosted a party Thursday night with our recruiters and close friends from law firms. See if you can spot your Recruiting Manager [enjoying the party](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153630475031909.1073741834.114551186908&type=1&l=8aa3561eb9). Don’t trust your career to just anyone. Do your homework.

# Cracking Open The Black Box Of Partnership Compensation
## As a general rule of thumb, partner compensation does not scale linearly with book of business.

A law firm’s compensation model for partners is oftentimes as mysterious as the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa. When partners look for new firms, they generally have a shortlist of expectations, such as good culture, strong practices and platforms, stable finances without too much debt, stellar reputations, and last but certainly not least, healthy compensation.

There is a common misconception that the compensation scales linearly with book of business from firm to firm. The reality is, very few firms abide by lockstep models, and PPP does not scale linearly with partner compensation either. As we see, average compensation as a percentage of your book of business decreases as originations increase.


For firms with a formulaic compensation model, there is not much wiggle room to influence your numbers, but you will have a good idea from the start about your take-home cash compensation. For firms with closed compensation systems, like the “black box,” a partner uses peer firms with formulaic models to benchmark what he assumes is market. Some firms are somewhere in the middle, open but subjective or semi-open and semi-formulaic. Most are closed, however.  There is not much consistency, so there is no real market to peg your value unless a you create one for oneself. One of the best ways to do this is to work with a veteran legal recruiter who can negotiate the best deal for you by creating a bidding war for your services. While it sounds easy in practice, the firms that can actually absorb your bill rates, meet your personal preferences, and clear conflicts checks are few and far between.

Although there is much uncertainty about partner compensation, here is a general rule of thumb I have seen firsthand and across the board in most regions. Partner compensation does not scale linearly with book of business. I have worked with groups of over 30 million dollars in business and with junior partners with just over a million in business and the compensation models can be much kinder to those on the lower end of the spectrum. As books of business grow larger, they require more and more support staff and overhead to maintain. The marginal compensation for a partner for each extra million dollars in business decreases almost instantaneously. There is a general efficiency ratio represented by:

 



A partner can only bill so many hours per year, so they need others to work on the excess work they originate. Even if a partner bills out at $1,000 an hour and bills 2,000 hours, that partner can only service two million dollars. If the partner is responsible for bringing in five million dollars, he will need several associates and support partners to help out.

When the book of business crosses the two million mark (i.e., 2,000 hours at $1,000 an hour), the actual take-home return diverges from the expected return as the single book of business starts to cost the firm more resources. This association is approximate and varies from firm to firm, nonetheless the general trend holds true in all of Biglaw. This does not mean that large books are bad, quite the opposite in fact, but it illustrates that it is important to find a firm that will not depreciate your book too drastically.

The law of diminishing returns is especially important for rainmakers when shopping for a new firm. Some firms reward books of businesses differently at the higher levels, and often times compensation is contingent on the firm’s cost structure and profit margins. Some of the most prestigious firms have low profit margins (i.e., someone in the 25 percent range), and if you have a large book of business, you may be better off going to a firm lower on the Am Law 200 list with a higher profit margin that would compensate you on a larger percentage of your book.

Cash rules when it comes to lateral partner moves, but many partners mistakenly believe that they will be more or less equally compensated at any firm. The most difficult part of partner placements is finding a firm with the right culture, with no conflicts, with a comparable hourly billing, and finally one that will fairly compensate a partner for their book of business.

We meet with every Am Law firm to learn not only about their lateral needs, but compensation structures and their platforms. We have a better sense of the factors, other than the book of business, that the firm will “weigh” for purposes of compensation. In addition, we know when the firm is willing to be opportunistic. The bottom line is that it is our job to maximize your options, and [my colleagues and I](https://www.laterallink.com/team) are happy to help.

# Biglaw And GCs Join Forces And Speak Out Against Attempts To Suppress The Vote

Equal access to voting is a fundamental right in the United States. Making voting easier, not harder, for all eligible voters should be the goal of every elected official. Election laws that impose unnecessary obstacles and barriers on the right to vote and that disenfranchise underrepresented groups represent a significant step backwards for all Americans. Now, more than ever, courageous leadership is required from our elected officials. We, the undersigned law firm managing partners and corporate general counsel, denounce all efforts to restrict the constitutional right of every eligible American to vote and to participate in our democracy.

— a statement [denouncing attempts to disenfranchise voters](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/12/dozens-of-big-firm-leaders-and-gcs-speak-out-against-unnecessary-obstacles-to-voting/) issued by [Brad Karp](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/brad-s-karp), chair of Paul Weiss and chair of the Legal Action Center, that’s been signed on to and supported by the leaders of 62 Am Law 100 firms and 19 general counsel. “It is simply the right thing to do,” [Lucy Fato](https://www.aig.com/about-us/leadership-and-governance/executive-leadership-team/lucy-fato), general counsel of AIG, said. “I don’t view it as a political issue. I view it as an American issue.” Fato rallied GCs at other companies to support the anti-voter suppression statement.

# Biglaw Firm Goes Over The Top On Bonuses For High Billers
## Happy news for big billers at this firm.

Some Biglaw firms are really hitting it out of the park this week when it comes to their bonus packages, and one of them is Sheppard Mullin.

Earlier today, the top-ranked Biglaw firm — which brought in $1,005,057,000 gross revenue in 2021 — announced its year-end bonuses, handsomely rewarding associates who went above and beyond the call of duty when it came to their billable hours.

Here’s the bonus scale looks like at Sheppard Mullin:

2021-2022 Measuring Period Hours Bonuses
1,900	1,950	2,000	2,200	2,400
A1	     10,000	     15,000	      20,000	        22,000	         24,000
A2	     15,000	     22,500	      30,000	        33,000	         36,000
A3	     28,750	     43,125	      57,500	        63,250	         69,000
M1	     37,500	     56,250	      75,000	        82,500	         90,000
M2	     45,000	     67,500	      90,000	        99,000	      108,000
M3	     52,500	     78,750	    105,000	      115,500	      126,000
C1	     57,500	     86,250	    115,000	      126,500	      138,000
C2	     57,500	     86,250	    115,000	      126,500	      138,000
As you can see, Sheppard Mullin awards base year-end bonuses at the 2000-hour mark, and those who go over on their billing will receive even more bonus bucks. Specifically, associates who record 2200 and 2400 hours will receive 110% and 120% of the market-based bonus. Associates will receive their bonus payouts in January.

Congratulations on your bonuses, associates!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Sheppard Mullin.)

# Ex-Biglaw Partner Sues Over 'Destroyed' Reputation Thanks To Overbilling Scandal

Overbilling gone wild?

It’s been three years since [DLA Piper’s](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/dla-piper/) billing practices came into question and made [big waves](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/03/overbilling-gone-wild-paying-the-dla-piper-plus-interesting-lateral-moves-into-and-out-of-dla/) thanks to a litigated billing dispute between the Biglaw firm and a former client. Normally, such a pedestrian suit wouldn’t have produced major headlines in the mainstream media, but this case was different — this case involved serious allegations of a “sweeping practice of overbilling,” supported by internal emails from DLA Piper that were peppered with phrases like “[t]hat bill shall know no limits,” and “churn that bill, baby!”

DLA Piper quickly denied that any overbilling had occurred and denounced the emails in question as “an offensive and inexcusable effort at humor.” The lawsuit between DLA Piper and Adam Victor, an energy industry executive who’d been accused of not paying his legal bills, has long since been [quietly settled](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/law-firm-dla-piper-settles-accusation-of-overbilling/?_r=0).

It seemed like this issue had been put to bed, but a former DLA Piper partner who was caught in the crosshairs of the email scandal is still feeling the reputational blow that came as a result of his connection to the controversy. Now he’s suing the firm’s outside counsel, whom he blames for letting the damaging emails see the light of day.

Last Friday, [Erich Eisenegger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erich-eisenegger-7183ab53) filed suit, asserting causes of action for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty against [Kramon & Graham](http://www.kramonandgraham.com/). The [New York Times](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/suit-offers-a-peek-at-the-practice-of-padding-a-legal-bill/) piece on the billing scandal that got Eisenegger so hot under the collar quoted an email from him in which he wrote, “I hear we are already 200k over our estimate — that’s Team DLA Piper!” [Courthouse News Service](http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/03/23/former-dla-partner-slams-email-release-as-careless.htm) has details Eisenegger’s filing (emphasis added):

Though hoping DLA’s outside counsel with Kramon & Graham “would competently represent him” in the Victor fee litigation, Eisenegger says the Baltimore firm’s “handling of the discovery … was marred by a series of costly errors steeped in gross negligence.” …

Eisenegger says the firm’s missteps damaged both DLA’s chance of success in the Victor litigation and the firm’s reputation, according to the complaint.

“Unlike DLA, however, whose size and multi-billion dollar brand was well equipped to continue and thrive after the embarrassing results of the discovery errors, Eisenegger’s singular profession[al] reputation was destroyed,” the complaint continues.

Eisenegger complains that Kramon breached rules of professional conduct in releasing “no less than 246,019 pages of unreviewed, unredacted documents which had not been reviewed for privilege, relevance, confidentiality, or any other basis for justifiably withholding or redacting the document.”

Eisenegger also claims that if Kramon had properly reviewed the documents in the first place, both he and DLA Piper could have avoided being dragged through the mud in the press. Eisenegger further claims that his comment — “I hear we are already 200k over our estimate – that’s Team DLA!” — was taken out of context, and had been meant as a warning. In fact, he says the much-publicized email string was “part of a much more thoughtful and serious discussion amongst associates and a DLA partner about DLA’s billing habits and professional lapses on … [Adam Victor’s original] case.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Eisenegger, who’d been working in a new partnership role at McDermott Will & Emery for about a year’s time when news of the email scandal first hit the presses, says that the firm fired him shortly thereafter. The erstwhile DLA and MWE partner claims that he “lost clients, pitch opportunities, the trust of his partners, and was unable to recover emotionally or professionally from his experience with the article and media frenzy.”

For someone who’s trying to save his reputation, it sure seems like this fellow isn’t familiar with the [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect). Eisenegger is representing himself in this case, which should tamp down on the possibility of any possibly incriminating emails being produced during discovery. Best of luck to Eisenegger as he churns his own bills.

# Introverted Associates Should Be More Welcomed At Law Firms
## The value of someone’s work product is rarely based on how introverted or extroverted they are.

Most people would agree that the legal industry is a relatively social profession. Attorneys regularly interact with clients, adversaries, court officers, and co-workers, and people who are outgoing may have an easier time navigating the social connections that are important to succeeding as a lawyer. However, this does not mean that introverted attorneys should face challenges advancing and succeeding at law firms, and introverted lawyers should be welcomed more at various shops.

Building social connections, and interacting with others, is often seen as a way to advance at law firms. People are naturally more likely to favor individuals with whom they have socialized since they thereafter know such people not only as co-workers in an office, but as friends who have a life outside of the office. Moreover, socializing is often an important element of business development. Clients are naturally more likely to trust someone if they have interacted with an attorney on a deeper, more personal level, and extroverted people may be more effective at forging the connections needed to develop a book of business.

However, introverted attorneys can be valued members of a team even if they do not wish to interact with co-workers or others as much as other attorneys. The value of someone’s work product is rarely based on how introverted or extroverted a person may be since court filings, oral arguments, and other important parts of the legal process do not depend on whether someone is extroverted or has people skills. Moreover, just because someone does not like to socialize as much or meet new folks does not mean that someone is less worthy of advancement or should be judged more harshly against more-extroverted associates.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Nevertheless, in my experience, introverted associates may face challenges at numerous law firms. Perhaps primarily, law firms may make hiring decisions based on who they like just as much as who can perform the best legal work. And who people like is often a function of who that person has socialized with or feels like they have a deeper, more personal bond with.

Earlier in my career, I worked at a law firm that had a summer associate class with a few outgoing summer associates and one summer associate who was far more introverted. The more introverted summer associate did not feel comfortable participating in the summer softball league, voluntary social outings, or other events that required this person to go outside of their shell. I am not completely sure how well this person did with assignments since I was not directly supervising them, so definitely take my observations with a grain of salt.

In any event, when it came time for the firm to make offers, they decided to give everyone an offer except for the introverted summer associate. The summer associate went to a top law school, and it seemed like they did fine work but was without a job offer after the summer program ended. The fact that this person did not interact as much with other people at the firm did not mean that this candidate would not have made a solid attorney at that shop, and firms should be more willing to give introverted associates a chance to succeed at firms.

More law firms should also alter their operations in order to realize the full potential of introverted associates. At some firms, especially larger law firms, it is common for attorneys on a team to have large brainstorming sessions to come up with ideas on tackling a problem. Such sessions can be extremely helpful since more heads are better than one, and the more people tackling a problem, the more creative the group generally becomes. I am an extroverted person, but from my own experience, introverted associates might be less likely to offer opinions in a large group of people. As such, law firms might be able to tap into more potential if they allow associates to offer advice in private settings so that introverted associates are more comfortable conveying opinions.

Furthermore, law firms should recognize how mandatory social events can be extremely daunting to introverted associates. People who are introverted may not want to interact with their co-workers in a social setting and may feel anxious around the holiday season and other periods that are filled with mandatory work social events. Law firms should try to limit the amount of mandatory social events they host throughout the year and preferably make social events truly voluntary so introverted people can avoid any issues they have with attending such functions.

All told, the legal profession often requires people to interact with others, and as a result, extroverted people may be rewarded for the social and personal connections they are able to forge. However, introverted associates should be valued by law firms, and more shops should accommodate introverted associates and judge all associates by their work product rather than how extroverted or introverted they are.

# Top Magic Circle Firm Takes A Chance On Artificial Intelligence
## The firm is happy to report that there won't be any kind of 'job apocalypse' thanks to its firmwide adoption of artificial intelligence technologies.

Biglaw firms are quickly adopting artificial intelligence technologies, and associates are rolling with the punches, because the robots won’t be coming for their jobs just yet.

The latest firm to adopt enhanced AI programming is Clifford Chance, which recently launched its own AI product firmwide in the wake of a successful trial period. [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/02/28/clifford-chance-rolls-out-microsoft-partnered-ai-strategy-across-whole-firm-405-137130/) has additional details on what the firm has been up to:

The U.K.-headquartered firm, which partnered up with technology giants Microsoft, has created what it describes as a “holistic suite of AI-powered workplace solutions”, now available to all its people around the world.

The new AI offering includes firm-wide access to Microsoft’s Chat-GPT-4-powered Co-Pilot platform for Microsoft 365 as well as Viva Suite.

It is hoped the tool will help across a variety tasks such as summarising documents, recording minutes and drafting emails.

The latest expansion comes after Clifford Chance became one of the first law firms to develop its own private and secured AI tool—Clifford Chance Assist—developed on Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI platform that was rolled out across the firm in December last year, following a trial involving over 1,000 of its people earlier in 2023.

In comments given to Law.com International, Nick Hedderman, senior director of the Modern Work Business Group, at Microsoft, said of the company’s partnership with the Biglaw firm that “Clifford Chance is driving real innovation in the legal sector by combining the power of Copilot for Microsoft 365 with Viva Suite as the tool for enabling change. This not only signifies dedication to AI-led innovation but also reflects the immense potential for everyone who works in the organization.”

Clifford Chance’s chief technology officer Paul Greenwood also spoke positively about the firm’s partnership with Microsoft, noting that employees need not worry about losing their jobs to the new technology. “[Microsoft doesn’t] foresee a job apocalypse, and we don’t buy into that either. If anything, people will become more productive and raise more value,” he said. “Everyone at the firm is already incredibly busy, and this will make work more interesting. It will be working in a different way.”

Congratulations to Clifford Chance on introducing its signature AI product to its entire workforce. Best of luck!

# 5 Concrete Steps Law Firms Can Take To Advance Diversity, Equity, And Inclusion
## It's all about intentionality, according to Yusuf Zakir, Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer at Davis Wright Tremaine.

As we know all too well, 2020 was a challenging year — for us as individuals, for the legal profession, and for the nation. But the year was not without its positive developments. In my view, the most significant positive change within Biglaw last year was an increased commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).

In fact, I would describe 2020 as the year that Biglaw got serious about diversity. At [Lateral Link](http://laterallink.com/), in practically every meeting we took with firms to discuss their talent needs, diversity was a central focus. And it wasn’t just all talk and no action, with firms boasting about their commitment to diversity but not doing anything differently. I saw many situations where firms really did do things differently for diversity, such as looking harder, keeping searches open for longer, and [working with diverse recruiters](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/one-simple-way-to-improve-your-recruitment-of-diverse-candidates/), who tend to have the strongest pipelines of diverse candidates.

We aren’t far into the new year, but so far, it seems that firms are continuing to focus on diversity in 2021. This past Tuesday, Davis Wright Tremaine LLP announced a great new policy:

Fostering DEI at our law firm and in the legal profession is everyone’s business.  These efforts and their resulting benefits make us better.  To that end, we are proud to announce the firm’s DEI Billable Hour Credit Policy.  With this policy, the firm will count up to 50 hours of eligible DEI activities annually towards the billable hour requirement for each full-time attorney.

The purpose of this policy is two-fold.  First, we seek to recognize and reward attorneys who are committed to DEI at Davis Wright Tremaine and in the broader legal profession.  Second, we seek to encourage broader participation in DEI initiatives across our attorney population.

Biglaw runs on billables, so giving billable-hour credit for diversity work is an important step. Because compensation at firms is generally tied to billable hours, Davis Wright and other firms with this policy are putting their money where their mouth is when it comes to diversity.

Here’s another step firms can take to advance diversity: hire a chief diversity officer. Indeed, law firms around the country have been on a hiring spree when it comes to diversity professionals. The [Association of Law Firm Diversity Professionals](https://alfdp.com/) (ALFDP) now boasts roughly 250 members, more than double its membership from just seven years ago.

Last October, Davis Wright Tremaine [hired its first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer](https://www.dwt.com/about/news/2020/10/dwt-names-first-chief-diversity-inclusion-officer), [Yusuf Zakir](https://www.dwt.com/people/z/zakir-yusuf). Before joining DWT, Zakir was the Director of Diversity and Inclusion at Holland & Knight, and before that, he was the Manager of Global Diversity, Recruiting, & Engagement at Latham & Watkins. He previously worked as a litigation associate at Latham before making the jump over to the DEI space in 2015. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Toronto and his law degree from Loyola Law School of Los Angeles, and he served as a law clerk to Judge Virginia A. Philips (C.D. Cal.).

The DEI Billable Hour Credit Policy is just one of a number of changes that Zakir and DWT have planned to promote diversity going forward. I recently spoke with Zakir to get his thoughts on how law firms should think about DEI.

Zakir agreed with my view that despite the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic and the recession, which disproportionately affected underrepresented and marginalized communities, Biglaw did make progress last year regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion.

“Over the second half of 2020, especially after George Floyd’s murder, discussions around DEI accelerated,” he said. “Firms are now being much more intentional about diversity compared to 2008. Back then, during the last economic downturn, DEI was not as established in law firms as it is today.”

Intentionality is a key concept when it comes to promoting diversity. Firms can’t just go about their business and let the problem of diversity somehow solve itself; effort must be made.

“At the end of the day, DEI is about how intentional we are,” Zakir said. “Managing partners, department and practice group chairs, and law firm partners in general need to be intentional about developing talent. How do we make sure that a commitment to diversity is fully embedded throughout the organization?”

Without intentionality, you run into problems like “affinity bias,” our unconscious tendency to work with and professionally develop people who are like us. Because the upper echelons of Biglaw are not very diverse, affinity bias can lead to the replication of this lack of diversity — unless law firm leaders and partners, especially equity partners, make conscious, intentional efforts to develop a broad range of talent, not just people who are like themselves.

How can law firms address affinity bias and other forms of unconscious bias? Yes, training is important — and if your firm doesn’t already have training on this, it should. And training shouldn’t just be something that employees go through when they join the firm and never go through again; it should be revisited and reinforced. For example, a firm might want to have the lawyers who conduct on-campus interviews at law schools go through a refresher training before the start of OCI.

But training alone isn’t sufficient to solve the problem of bias.  Zakir emphasized that firm processes also need to be structured in ways that address the potential influence of bias, perhaps through the addition of “bias interrupters.”

Again, take on-campus interviewing at law schools. This is definitely an area where unconscious bias can have an effect; interviewers tend to bond with interviewees who are like them. Indeed, this is why law firms often send alumni of a particular school back to their alma maters for OCI, so they can bond with the applicants.

To address potential affinity bias, some firms have added a bias interrupter to the OCI process, Zakir explained. If an interviewer passes on a candidate from an underrepresented group, the interviewer might be asked to articulate in more detail why they made that decision, instead of just not putting the candidate on the callback list. The interviewer might still make the same decision in the end, but at least they will do so with intentionality, not unthinkingly.

Intentionality should extend to compensation as well, according to Zakir. In other words, firms shouldn’t just pay people what they want to pay them and let the chips fall where they may. Instead, firms need to track how compensation breaks down along such lines as gender and race/ethnicity — and if the results are not equitable, firms need to ask why.

Given all the changes law firms are making, large and small, to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion, Zakir is optimistic about the future of DEI in Biglaw.

“There is rightfully a lack of patience on the part of many,” he said. “But change takes time.  The upcoming presidential inauguration reminds us of that.  Kamala Harris will be the first in so many categories as Vice President—first woman, first Black or South Asian woman, first person of color.  Harris was born less than a year before the Voting Rights Act was passed.  And next week, she will become the Vice President. This is incredible progress, but it can be traced back to the work of individuals over time who committed to these efforts and paved the way for others.  Progress takes time—but change does come.”

To recap, here are five steps law firms can take to promote diversity, equity and inclusion, if they have not taken them already:

- Give billable-hour credit for DEI work.
- Hire a chief diversity officer.
- Implement a robust training regimen that extends beyond onboarding.
- Consider adding bias interrupters to firm processes that could be affected by unconscious bias.
- Track compensation and structure compensation systems with diversity in mind.
Of course, there is no single action a law firm can take to ensure diversity. Advancing DEI requires intentionality, long-term commitment, and leadership from the top. It’s hard work.

The good news is that 2020 was a year when law firms started focusing on diversity. And even though many of us are happy to turn on the page on last year, let’s hope that Biglaw’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion remains with us, for many years to come.

I know: My headline is an old, bad joke.

It gets even worse: This column isn’t about money.

I recently attended a corporate program focused on “trust” — what it is, how to build it, and how to repair it once it’s broken.

The speakers started by explaining the elements of trust. The first element was “reliability.”

I worked for 25 years at law firms. For me, “reliability” would have been the first element of trust. And the second element. And the third. And all the rest of ’em. And we could then stop the conversation.

That’s what brought the old, bad joke to mind: Reliability may not be everything — but it’s sure way ahead of whatever’s in second place.

Be reliable.

That makes me trust you.

Don’t be reliable, and we’re done. I’ll never use you again.

I gotta get the brief out the door. If you say you’ll get a draft to me on Tuesday, I expect a draft on Tuesday. And the draft has to be more or less ready to go. If you don’t deliver projects (1) on time and (2) in reasonably good shape, we’re through.

If you do deliver things on time and right, I’ll work with you again and again and again.

That’s the way of law firms.

End of story.

Corporations, it seems, are different.

(Maybe it’s not just corporations. Maybe the whole world is different, and it’s law firms that are the outliers. But — like a fish asking, “What water?” — when you grow up in a law firm, you never notice that the law firm environment is odd.)

Trust, it turns out, has four (!) elements. “Reliability” is the first.

“Acceptance” is second. This means accepting people for who they are. It’s the distinction, I suppose, between, “He’s a jerk,” and, “He’s not performing.” One criticizes the person; the other, the performance.

At law firms, I don’t think people pay much attention to this. If someone promises a brief on Tuesday and doesn’t deliver it, he could be a jerk, or not performing, or anything else. It doesn’t matter; I’ll never work with him again.

The third element of trust is “openness.” You must clarify what you expect and provide feedback on how things are going. You should also relate how you feel, what you believe, and your areas of vulnerability.

At law firms, a few partners are good at the first aspects of “openness.” They know that they receive better work if they clarify what they expect, and (at least for associates who are reliable and therefore worth the effort) they provide feedback.

But, when it comes to the broader dimensions of openness — revealing your own vulnerabilities — law firm partners turn into Scrooge: “Bah, humbug! Who cares how I feel? Just get me the brief on time.”

Finally, “congruence.” (Maybe law firms don’t care about this because they don’t understand it.) The speakers at my program defined “congruence” as “the knowledge that what you say is on track with what you believe, what you feel is the truth, and what you do.” (Maybe law firms don’t care about this because they still don’t understand it.) You should be straightforward and honest, saying what is true, even if it is unpleasant.

Law firm partners are often pretty good about saying things that are unpleasant. (Some would say they specialize in this.) But, long ago, a more-senior partner suggested that I should sugarcoat things: “Don’t tell people that they’re mediocre! Tell ’em all that they’re great! If you tell people they’re great, they’ll run through brick walls for you! If you tell people they’re average, they’ll be discouraged and won’t work very hard.”

Well, yeah.

But they won’t know the truth.

So maybe some partners believe in congruence and some don’t.

Those are the four aspects of trust and how law firm life differs from corporate life. But there’s one other thing that’s worth considering.

Here’s an interesting thought experiment on reliability: Consider how reliable you are in three different environments — at work, at home, and to yourself. Rate yourself on a score of one to ten on your reliability in each area (with ten being the highest).

If you’re succeeding in the law, you score yourself a “10” on reliability at work: If you say you’ll do something, you do it. Period.

But perhaps you worry less about being reliable to friends, or family, or commitments you make to yourself, because it seems that the stakes are lower. (You promise your daughter that you’ll be home in time for her birthday party. Are you still a “10”?)

Maybe you’re equally reliable in all aspects of your life. But maybe not.

You always hurt those most important to you.

Who hasn’t been swept away by the Spartan romance of the county jailhouse interview room? The fluorescent lighting casting shadows on the sterile concrete… so hot.

The story out of Florida — of course it’s Florida — is that a local attorney let that romance overcome her during a recent client interview:

A jail deputy walked in on Jessica Mishali, 35, and her client, convicted felon Ysreal Granda, 26, about 3 p.m. Wednesday and saw the pair “engaged in what appeared to be sexual intercourse,” a police report said.

Granda is jailed on four felony charges including two counts of attempted murder, records show. He was released from a Florida prison in March 2012 after serving the majority of a four-year sentence for a conviction on two counts of attempted murder in Miami-Dade County.

Wow.

Needless to say, this event has sparked the interest of the Florida Bar and gotten her locked out of all Broward County jails:

A memo with Mishali’s photo has been posted at all jail scanners and master controls, stating: “Jessica Mishali David is prohibited from entering any Broward Sheriff’s Office facility or onto any BSO property for any reason either personal or professional until further notice.”

The “David” in there is a nod to the fact that Mishali is also married, which has to make these allegations even harder. It’s one thing to face a professional crisis, and another to have your life partner afraid that you stabbed him in the back by getting stabbed in the back by a guy who stabs people in the back (technically this time he’s facing charges for firing “six shots into a car the mother of his 6-year-old daughter was riding in with another man).

Mishali doesn’t face any criminal charges, but getting barred from the jailhouse is an unfortunate turn for a criminal defense lawyer. But this is a fluid situation and we’ll see how this all shakes out after we hear her side of it:

When reached by telephone Thursday, Mishali, of Hollywood, declined to comment. “I’m not at liberty to comment because of attorney-client privilege,” she said.

That is… a curious reading of the privilege.

In 2018, [Alex van der Zwaan](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/alex-van-der-zwaan/?rf=1), a former associate at the London office of Skadden Arps, [pleaded guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/former-skadden-associate-who-pleaded-guilty-in-mueller-probe-begs-for-no-jail-time/) to charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. He’d worked on the controversial report written by the firm justifying the prosecution of former Russian-aligned Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s political rivals, and was indicted for lying to investigators in the Russia probe about his communications with former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates. Facing up to six months in prison, he [begged for leniency](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/former-skadden-associate-who-pleaded-guilty-in-mueller-probe-begs-for-no-jail-time/) in sentencing and lucked out, [serving 30 days in jail](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/former-skadden-associate-is-first-to-be-sentenced-in-mueller-probe/), as well as a fine of $20,000.

On top of his new criminal record, van der Zwaan lost his job at one of the most prestigious firms in the world for his gross misconduct. He’d worked at Skadden for a decade prior to getting caught up in the Mueller probe.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But that wasn’t the end of his punishment.

After [being deported](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/05/politics/alex-van-der-zwaan-deported/index.html) from the U.S. following his time served, van der Zwaan [lost his license to practice law](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/the-ex-skadden-associate-jailed-as-part-of-the-mueller-probe-cant-be-a-lawyer-anymore/) in the U.K. in July of 2019. Without a livelihood to fall back on, we’re not sure what the former Biglaw attorney has been up to for the last year and a half, but we sure know now because he lucked out once again.

Van der Zwaan is likely celebrating, because he [received a full pardon](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/12/22/ex-skadden-associate-convicted-in-mueller-probe-is-among-wave-of-trump-pardons/) for his “process-related crime” from President Donald Trump last night. Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, a partner at Nelson Mullins, supported the pardon. George Papadopoulos, who was also taken down as a result of the Mueller probe, received a full pardon as well.

We suppose congratulations are in order for van der Zwaan, but what good is a pardon when the final nail in your career’s coffin has already been hammered in? Best of luck.

# The Extraordinary Journey Of Cece Xie
## Above the Law's Alex Su and TikTok luminary Cece Xie talk about Biglaw, her book, and more.

Cece Xie (courtesy photo)

[Cece Xie](https://cecexie.com/), a former Biglaw associate who became a bona fide influencer with over 400,000 followers, has had one of the most remarkable stories of balancing content creation with a career in the law. Unlike [some of us](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/a-funny-thing-happened-on-my-way-to-a-law-career/) who left the practice before becoming a content creator, Cece “blew up” on TikTok while working at her day job as an associate at Morrison & Foerster.

I first met Cece virtually at an online creator meetup in 2021. I’m used to being the more “famous” creator in most conversations with lawyers, but this time it was the other way around. It was so surreal to actually meet and talk to her, especially since I’d been following her TikTok account for some time.

Over the next year we stayed in touch, and even co-hosted a [CLE for the Washington Bar Association’s Corporate Counsel Section](https://www.mywsba.org/PersonifyEbusiness/CLEStore/Social-Media-for-Lawyers--Law-Students/ProductDetail/21023526). And a few months ago, bringing the internet and the real world together — we finally met in person at the NAPABA conference in Las Vegas (which was super cool)!

After catching up about all things law and content creation, I realized that Cece’s story involved a lot more than what she usually shares publicly. She’s had such an extraordinary journey. So it was obvious to me that I should interview her to share what it was like going through the process of becoming “TikTok famous” and what she’s currently working on. Which led to this column today.

Without further ado, here’s an abbreviated version of our conversation:

Alex Su: How did you create such a large social media audience as a Biglaw associate?

Cece Xie: TikTok was honestly a fluke — my partner had downloaded TikTok in December 2019 because he wanted to stay in the know about trends, what the kids are talking about — he’s honestly the much cooler one as between the two of us — and I remember thinking that it was just a lip-syncing app for teenagers at the time. My birthday rolled around in April during the height of the pandemic’s first wave, and I was like, “There is no way I can spend my birthday doing the same exact thing that I’ve been doing every other day — I need to do something different.” But there wasn’t anything to do at that time — we knew nothing about COVID, not even if we could meet with people outside, so I decided that for my birthday, I would try making a TikTok. To my surprise, it went kinda viral, and I kept on posting because I had nothing else to channel my creative energy into at the time. It was fun to challenge myself to create different types of video, y’know? Even if my first day in the life of a Biglaw attorney video took me four hours of editing alone. And that was the first video that really, really took off.

AS: Four hours? That’s an incredible amount of work! But it sounds like it all paid off because it went viral. Why do you think that first video did so well?

CX: In retrospect, there’s this huge hunger to know about what being an adult is like, I think. I started getting questions from people about how to get a Biglaw job, whether undergrad matters for law school admissions, and it reminded me of all the questions I had when I was younger, except I never got to see videos from people who had answers to those questions. So I decided to start sharing more about my journey and all of the things I learned along the way, to force myself to start describing the air around me that I had gotten used to and was no longer aware of. And that turned out to really resonate with people.

AS: After going viral did you worry about how it would impact your day job? I mean, I first went viral as a legal tech salesperson. You were a Biglaw associate!

CX: I really didn’t think too much at first about how my TikTok could impact my life at work — I mean, I already had a public Instagram, and I think it’s fairly common for associates of my class to have public social media accounts. My firm at the time had a social media policy, which I took a look at in the early days of creating just to be sure that I was always on the right side of the line. Yes, there is always a risk with putting anything out there in the open, but as long as you stand by what you post in both personal and professional settings, what is there to be worried about? It wasn’t until I got my first media inquiry that I realized my account probably had gotten big enough that it was time to raise it with the firm. They were fantastic about it, actually — they set up meetings with the firm’s PR person for media training, helped me develop a process for both media inquiries and — believe it or not — brand deals, really stood behind me even during the more trying times of being online, like when firm leadership received a hate email about me after one of my posts got picked up by the NY Post and Daily Mail. It was really encouraging and a huge vote-of-confidence in my judgment and my contributions to the firm. I think it definitely helped that I was a midlevel/senior associate at the time, had great reviews, was already doing something besides being an associate (teaching a class at Yale), and had really great sponsors at the firm already. You get a lot more latitude to go off the straight-and-narrow if you’ve already proven to the powers-that-be that you’ve mastered the straight-and-narrow, I think, and my firm at the time really is on the more progressive end, as well, as Biglaw firms go.

AS: It seems like you really knew how to navigate the firm. As an associate that was something I always struggled with, like the unspoken rules of how to get things done. How did you learn to do that?

CX: The only way that anyone can really get the lowdown on Biglaw — through office gossip! But like the good kind, not the cruel or nasty kind that has no place in society. I remember sitting in my office with my officemate and trading information — which partners we had heard were lovely to work with, which partners had blown up at someone we had summered with, which partners were the most generous when it came to summer lunches. It’s hard to learn about things that will be helpful for your specific experience of Biglaw through school info sessions or firm trainings — at the end of the day, the associates and partners whom you work with have the biggest impact on your experience, so you need to dissect things on an individual-by-individual basis. Which can only really be accomplished through directly working with those individuals or talking to others who have worked with them. Even little things like whether this partner prefers Track Changes or a redline wasn’t actually so little, and I figured that I would inevitably make mistakes, so it was up to me to get as much as I could right — even these supposedly little formatting things or arranging everyone in the CC by seniority — in anticipation of accruing enough goodwill so that the mistake I make later won’t seem as large. Every time I was assigned to a matter, I would schedule a coffee or call or Zoom with a slightly more senior associate who had worked a lot with the partner in charge of the matter, and I would ask them about the partner’s work preferences and idiosyncrasies. I did it largely out of anxiety at the time — like I knew that I didn’t know the rules, so I had to really try and learn the rules — but now I see that intel-gathering as helpful foundation-building, no matter the context.

AS: Which all junior associates would benefit from, right?

CX: Totally. As I got more senior, I realized that I all of a sudden was the associate that the juniors reached out to with questions about how to work with certain partners, how to bill time, how to ask for vacation. It was a really bizarre moment, realizing that I had gone from someone who hadn’t known the rules to someone who seemed to know the rules. That, combined with all of the questions I got on social media, helped me recognize just how far I had come in terms of learning both the substantive and cultural elements of Biglaw. And while the specifics of how I navigated Biglaw wouldn’t apply for everyone — because it’s ultimately on an individual basis — I wanted to demystify the process of how I managed to glean the information. Like yes, the details may be different between partners and between firms, but the way of finding out those details — that template for doing so — is relatively static, and I wanted to give people a roadmap to learn what they needed to learn in order to thrive in whatever legal setting they found themselves in. (Examples: see [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@cecexie/video/7148472887769419050), [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@cecexie/video/6989645240218995973), and [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@cecexie/video/7037929033258126597).)

AS: Given that you understood so much about how things work, why did you decide to leave the firm?

CX: This is always a funny question to me, because it’s probably THE most common question I get nowadays, and I don’t think I would get asked it as much if I had left to go in-house or to a smaller firm. I think there’s something about leaving Biglaw for something more uncharted that piques people’s curiosities, which is understandable. Two years ago, I didn’t see myself leaving Biglaw and honestly was low key starting to think about all the steps I would need to take in order to be a serious contender for partner. It wasn’t until I was chatting with a creator friend who then offered to introduce me to her literary agent that I even thought about another career path outside of strictly the law.


The lit agent and I met, and he really liked my book ideas, so I signed with him and the next step was to write the book proposal. Except I was horrible at making time to write the book proposal. Work would be busy, or if work wasn’t busy, I was trying to spend time with friends, attend weddings, sit on my couch and play video games. Every month, I would send my agent an email basically apologizing that no progress had been made. After sending that sad apology email a few times, I realized that if I ever wanted to make this book a reality, I would have to shake up my life somehow — but I was really, really scared to quit with nothing else lined up. It felt like it would be an affront to my upbringing and the very much risk-averse way that I had lived my life up until then. So I [applied to a Ph.D. in Law program](https://youtu.be/H9jjfxUE2iE), [got rejected](https://youtu.be/SuCJR-L-cvM), and then had to seriously ask myself whether I was ready to quit my quite lovely time at the firm for the unknown.


[The answer was yes.](https://youtu.be/1sq0bQN3Qec) I had always loved reading and writing — which I think is quite common for lawyers — but had never thought I would get the opportunity, both time-wise and financially, to write a book, at least not until I was comfortably retired. But with this opportunity in front of me, having already jumped the first hurdle of getting an agent, it felt silly to not at least give it a shot — a real shot. I did, of course, talk to people about this decision and learned that returning to Biglaw within two years wouldn’t be a problem, given my practice area and seniority, so it seemed like the downside was even less than what I had imagined. I’ve always been pretty meticulous about planning every second of my life, but I was starting to see, just around me and with my high school and college friends, that the happiest and most fulfilled people had gone off-plan at some point in their lives. So it felt like it was time to choose the unknown path rather than the known, to really push myself out of my comfort zone, to try something that I had always wanted to do but never thought I could.


It was honestly one of the scariest things that I had ever done, made much worse by the slew of armchair critics online who wasted no time in telling me that I was wasting my education, I had taken a more deserving person’s spot in law school and as a member of the bar, I was uninteresting and boring if I weren’t a lawyer. Those voices hurt a lot because on some level, I agreed with them — and it took a good nine months before my inner critic stopped parroting their comments to me.

AS: What are you working on now?

CX: Mostly just trying to figure it out! Now that I don’t have projects and timelines set by partner or client demands, most of last year was a huge experiment. I posted more on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/cecexie), tried a [solo podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/6Wkb44PEYlsB9AGEbeedx5), and [finished my book proposal](https://www.tiktok.com/@cecexie/video/7145596900442590510). I tried to pay special attention to how working on each step in those projects made me feel — energized? Motivated? Deflated? Depressed? The plan this year is to take all of that information learned from experimenting and work more on what I like to work on — namely, thinking and writing. To that end, I moved my blog over to a [Substack](https://cecexie.substack.com/), plan on creating video essays and vlogs for [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/cecexie), and am going to keep on podcasting in some way, shape, or form. And of course, the big project of this year will be writing [my book](https://www.tiktok.com/@cecexie/video/7171497334898183470)!

AS: Tell us about your book!

CX: I’ve been thinking about Biglaw and the legal industry for quite a while, but the real impetus to put pen to paper came out of an interview I had with a journalist, who was reporting on how the pandemic was impacting Biglaw associates. After I spoke with him, he told me a few months later that they ended up having to cut the story because they couldn’t find associates willing to come forward and speak candidly about their experiences. That was disappointing but not surprising to me — I’m very much aware of Biglaw’s culture of silence, which is what makes lawsuits against Biglaw firms so rare and the whisper network of office gossip so valuable. So I got to thinking about writing about my own experience — and maybe my friends’ experiences — in Biglaw, as a way to break through that culture of silence. When I was researching “comps” [competing books] for my proposal, I was astonished to find that while there was a plethora of novels about Biglaw, there weren’t any nonfiction books about the experience of working in Biglaw. Which was just wild to me, because I love behind-the scenes industry books like “Liar’s Poker” by Michael Lewis and “Uncanny Valley” by Anna Wiener. I got to thinking about all of the stories that my law school classmates and colleagues would share with one another, stories that are valuable commentaries on Biglaw culture and shine a light on the industry’s practices (both good and bad), and started wondering whether I could create a way for people to share their stories in a comfortable way, with someone who has also gone through the machine and understands what that’s like. That’s when the scope of the book became larger, as I really want to capture both the joy and the ills of working in Biglaw, incorporate different perspectives of the Biglaw experience, and ultimately meditate on what Biglaw’s practices mean for us as people and society as a whole, going forward. So if any readers have any notable experiences in Biglaw — good or bad! — and are willing to chat with me about them, [I’d love to be a sounding board for those stories or ideas about the future of biglaw.](https://cecexie.com/your-biglaw-story)

# Another Biglaw Firm Raises Associate Salaries To Take Their Place In The Top Tier Of The Industry
## The pressure mounts for the top of Biglaw to match the latest round of salary increases.

The Biglaw raises sweeping through the industry continue! The new $225,000 scale is taking hold at the most elite firms, and the pressure is on to see which firms are able to match.

Fresh off of the [awkward call for charitable donations](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/good-biglaw-firm-encourages-charitable-donations-bad-biglaw-firm-reminds-associates-they-havent-gotten-raises/), Allen & Overy raised associate salaries and announced bonuses. The international mega firm has affirmed its commitment to paying its attorneys at the top of the market with a set of compensation hikes that matches the scale set by Milbank/Cravath.

The new salary grid at A&O is as follows:

Class Year	2024 Annual Salary
Class of 2023	$225,000
Class of 2022	$235,000
Class of 2021	$260,000
Class of 2020	$310,000
Class of 2019	$365,000
Class of 2018	$390,000
Class of 2017	$420,000
Class of 2016	$435,000
The bonus scale at the firm is as follows:

Year-End Bonus
Class of 2023	$15,000 (prorated)
Class of 2022	$20,000
Class of 2021	$30,000
Class of 2020	$57,500
Class of 2019	$75,000
Class of 2018	$90,000
Class of 2017	$105,000
Class of 2016	$115,000
This also matches the scale at soon-to-be merger partner [Shearman & Sterling](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/shearman-compesation-23/), which makes sense.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Calling All Texans: What The Hell Is Going On With Haynes & Boone's Bonuses?
## Are people outside of Texas making more money?

Haynes and Boone announced its bonuses this week, and with it, the Cravath match has come to Texas. The firm does individualized bonuses, but people in Dallas are telling us that they received a match of the Cravath scale.

Thing is, people outside of Texas are telling us that they received more. [Like, we’re talking Geico Christmas ad MORE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW1ap6WR81w).

I think of Haynes & Boone as the anthropomorphic “Texas law firm” because its main offices are in Texas, and it represented T. Boone Pickens, and T. Boone Pickens is basically [The Rich Texan](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Rich_Texan). But the firm has 15 offices in places like D.C. and Chicago and New York (which I had to look up).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
There was a time when bonuses were more regional and you expected the same firm to pay out different bonuses in, say, San Antonio, than what they paid out in New York. But that time has largely passed. At least we thought it had.

But maybe HayBoo is bringing it back? Again, because the bonuses are individualized, we can’t really tell. We could just be hearing from associates outside of Texas who received more money for outstanding effort. Those people might be eager to talk to us, while most associates outside of Texas received a standard Cravath match and therefore feel like they have nothing to report.

Then again, we don’t seem to have anybody reporting that they received significantly more than Cravath while working in a Texas office for Haynes and Boone so…?

Let us know what you made. Hell, with the passage of the GOP tax plan, I wouldn’t be surprised if associates AND partners in high-tax blue states started demanding a greater share of the firm’s profits to offset the destruction aimed directly at them. I know if Above the Law had an office in Dallas right now, I’d be like “move me or raise me.”

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please email it to us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text (646-820-8477), or tweet (@ATLblog). We always keep our sources anonymous — and that includes our sources for bonus stories. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Do you like to be in the know? Do you love gossiping with friends and co-workers over the latest bonus news? Then you simply must sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts.

# Biglaw Firms Think They're Paying Associates Enough Money To Deal With Toxic Partners
## The industry needs to do better.

Every year American Lawyer conducts a [Midlevel Survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/08/05/the-2022-midlevel-associate-survey/) finding out exactly what’s on the minds of third through fifth year associates in Biglaw. According to [this breakdown](https://www.law.com/2022/08/31/in-demand-midlevels-cant-escape-big-laws-bad-partner-problem/) of the results, they received *hundreds* of complaints about the toxic partners in Biglaw.

And even at firms where most of the partners were good to work for, the risk of a bad boss really impacts associates’ overall experience. Take a look at what some folks wrote about firms:

One Weil, Gotshal & Manges associate said the firm’s rotating assignment system means associates live in fear of being staffed on matters with bad partners. “When I am staffed with good managers I genuinely like my firm; it’s not perfect but the good people are amazing,” the associate said. “When you get a bad manager, it poisons everything. I was not prepared for the extent that a manager’s whims can dictate your life.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“The excellent partners and other attorneys who are role models, mentors, and decent human beings do not cancel out or compensate for the partners who are terrible to work with,” said one Morgan, Lewis & Bockius associate. “The rotten few ruin what would otherwise be a great place to work.”

“Ropes & Gray is fantastic as an institution; however, the culture does not encourage partners to invest in associates and, as a consequence, we feel fungible and like we have no future at the firm, particularly when we don’t get timely, constructive feedback,” said one associate. “When we have no chance of becoming partner and are not getting good, informal training and professional development, it can be hard to justify staying.”

Alas, industry experts are report that firms by and large think those [eye-popping lateral bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/) they’ve been dishing out mean they’ve already paid associates enough to deal with the bullshit:

“What I’ve been told by some senior partners at some big firms is that there’s a dire need for high-quality corporate associates and they’re paying to get them, so they’re not worried about the issue of whether the partners are too harsh with them,” said Dr. Larry Richard, who studies the psychology of lawyers and advises large firms on talent issues. “If they’re paying you a $100,000 signing bonus, firm leaders think that that should cover the harshness. That’s not the answer I’d like to hear or how I would counsel them, but that’s what I’m hearing from them.”

And even for firms trying to remedy their toxic partners, that work is not always visible to associates:

“It might be that the firm doesn’t value its associates very much, or it could be that they’re coaching the partner and continuing to hold out hope that the person will remedy their bad behavior,” [Law firm management consultant and former Orrick leader Ralph Baxter] said. “There’s an answer somewhere between the firm doesn’t care, they’re working on it and they haven’t been successful yet, and the partner has an offsetting benefit that causes the firm to tolerate their behavior.”

But the truth remains, toxic partners continue to be seen as a feature, not a bug at Biglaw firms. If firms are serious about keeping valuable associates, that’s something they need to work on.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Attorneys in commercial transactions handle many types of transactions and support activities like advertising and promotion. There are several forms of transactions. For example, every business has agreements for sales of goods and services, and supply arrangements. Also, many businesses have a need for marketing agreements, resale or distribution agreements, or franchising deals.

While transactions differ in form and substance, there are common elements. Each transaction must define the scope of the deal (exclusivity, geography and term) and establish the parties’ respective responsibilities and conditions to performance. Attorneys craft the agreement to allocate risk among the parties and ensure that the form of the transaction meets regulatory requirements and does not trigger undesired obligations.

A commercial attorney can work on a few different transactions in a day. The initial work usually involves client meetings where you discuss objectives and expectations for the transaction. Complicated transactions often begin with a term sheet that sets the framework for the fully negotiated agreement. Associates often draft term sheets and deal documents and review drafts and comments from counsel to the counterparty. They can also expect to research regulations and consult with specialized attorneys in other practice areas to make sure that specific issues are addressed in the agreement.

At a firm, junior associates will mostly work with senior associates and partners in their practice area. They will also collaborate with specialists in other areas. For example, it is common to seek advice from antitrust counsel for distribution arrangements and to work with intellectual property lawyers when a transaction includes licensing of patents or trademarks. They will also deal with attorneys for the counterparty and participate in negotiations attended by both the parties and counsel.

In many cases, associate also deal with various functions within a client’s business, especially when the client does not have in-house counsel. Those functions include sales, marketing, finance, and purchasing. Those conversations require strong counseling skills and an ability to understand the factors that drive business decisions.

- What does a common career path look like?
Typically, new attorneys join large law firms to gain experience. Initially, they work on improving drafting skills, tracking the open issues, and making sure that all of the requirements for the deal have been met. During this time they learn about the different types of transactions, key issues, and market practice. Over time, junior associates get involved in negotiations and client counseling. Eventually, they may develop their own client base through career-development activities such as networking and public speaking. After several years of practice, it is common for associates to take an in-house position (often with a client) or move to a new firm that is smaller or more specialized.

- If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?

Commercial work involves many different forms of transactions and the ability to understand various business models. Commercial lawyers have to master the terminology and common solutions for each form of agreement. In many cases, they will need to be creative and revise a template to develop a solution that matches the client’s business model.

The subject matter of the deals can be very important, and commercial lawyers must understand the regulations that apply to the underlying business. For example, clients who work on government contracts may need to include specific labor requirements and government rights in deals with their vendors. Also, if commercial lawyers work on advertising or other promotional work (for example, sweepstakes), they need to understand what federal and state regulations apply and the requirements that must be met.

Junior commercial lawyers can improve their effectiveness and increase their value by asking to work on different types of deals across a few industries.

- How much wear and tear?
Clients often want to close a deal quickly in order to take advantage of an opportunity. That can be both exciting and challenging. Commercial attorneys need to manage their time effectively and adjust to the ebb and flow of work. There can be weeks when work is relatively slow and others when several transactions need to be completed in days. Despite the fast pace, the attorneys must be thorough and assess the risks of each transaction. For junior attorneys, there can be a lot of document review and preparation in a short time. Failure to identify an issue or a drafting mistake can lead to significant costs. For example, the clients could find themselves in breach, may have assumed a risk that they had not considered, or may not receive a benefit they thought they had bargained for.

- Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?
The most common complaint from those who hate it is burnout from a workflow that can be difficult to predict. Circumstances can demand that an attorney handle a large volume of complex work in a short time. That can be stressful and create scheduling challenges.

- Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?
Many commercial lawyers like working closely with the business and developing solutions. It can be very gratifying to contribute to a client’s success. Also, the deals are often very important to the business, and clients tend to view the lawyer as a trusted advisor who has seen many transactions and knows the pitfalls.

- Are there common avenues out of this practice area?
A common path out is an in-house counsel position. Many attorneys who go in-house continue to work on transactions but also become an integral part of the management team. For them, the day-to-day nature of the work changes from handling deal documents to counseling and strategizing. Some attorneys use the in-house role to move on to non-legal roles within the business. Companies often find that commercial attorneys understand the business and can use their analytical and organizational skills to take on another role, such as general manager. Other attorneys change their focus by developing specialized, industry-specific legal skills that involve compliance with regulations.

- What are some market trends that impact this practice area?
Commercial work is fairly steady but the volume of work tends to follow the business cycle.

The nature of commercial transactions has evolved in recent years, with many more transactions and promotions being handled online and across borders. As these business practices change, there are increases or changes in the regulation of commerce, such as measures for consumer protection. When those changes are implemented, the targeted industry can see a lot of activity in the form of changes to transaction terms and implementation of new processes to meet requirements.

- If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?
A good candidate would have the requisite legal skills and a genuine interest in developing solutions for businesses. A commercial attorney must have very good attention to detail, be a strong communicator, and be able to master a lot of facts quickly. The best candidates are those who will invest the time to learn their client’s business model so that they understand the opportunities and associated risks. The candidate should view himself or herself as someone who is skilled in helping team members achieve their business objectives while maintaining the long-term health of the business.

Nine years later and BASF and its former counsel, Cahill Gordon, have agreed to a settlement over allegations they concealed potential asbestos in industrial and commercial talc. As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1294980/basf-cahill-pay-73m-to-settle-claims-they-hid-asbestos) Law360, the $73 million fund will allow up to 20,000 plaintiffs to seek between $500 and $175,000 from the fund.

Those potential 20,000 plaintiffs will include those who brought litigation against BASF or their predecessor Englehard Corp between 1984 and 2011 over Emtal Talc products, used in industrial applications. The proposed class had their claims voluntarily dismissed, settled the suit, or had it involuntarily dismissed prior to March 2011. The plaintiffs allege that BASF and Cahill falsely asserted there was no evidence to suggest the talc products had asbestos, leading to the dismissals/settlements:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“In 2009, plaintiffs’ counsel obtained evidence, which they believe contradicted the claims made by defendants in the underlying lawsuits about Emtal Talc,” the motion said.

The trial court initially dismissed the lawsuit, but it was revived on appeal to the Third Circuit. It then underwent years of discovery disputes and attempts at mediation.

“After two intense, arms-length sessions conducted in the fall and winter of 2018, the parties in January 2019 forged an accord on the elements of a settlement. With an agreement in principle to settle the case, the parties negotiated and executed a term sheet,” the motion said.

And though this case is (only) nine years old, some of the underlying claims stem from almost 40 years ago, adding to the challenges of continuing the litigation. Which is just another good reason for the proposed settlement:

“After more than nine years of contentious litigation and extensive discovery, the parties, with the assistance of mediators, have reached a proposed class action settlement that is fair, reasonable and adequate for class members,” the motion for preliminary approval of the settlement said. “The settlement recognizes that the plaintiffs and the defendants each face substantial risks and costs in proceeding further with this litigation, and that resolving the case now provides benefits to both sides.”

Cahill has not commented on the proposed settlement.

March may be rapidly coming to a close, but that doesn’t mean the associate salary game is over!

Just the other day, Holland & Knight — on the back of the firm’s “strongest financial performance in the history of the firm” — announced raises for hardworking associates. And, of course, with $1,044,337,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it 38th on the Am Law 100, the firm is matching that top-of-market compensation grid popularized by Cravath.

For associates — well, at least the ones in the Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Fort Worth, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Orange County, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Samford, Tysons, and Washington, D.C. offices — the new salary scale at Holland & Knight is as follows:



Like the last set of raises, these are retroactive to January 1. You can read the memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/hk-raises-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

We are equipped to mobilize a number of lawyers. What I’m hoping to see is that we can provide some real organization and backbone to the effort so that lawyers who are either individual practitioners or smaller firms can access resources and get involved in ways that aren’t compromising to their own practices.

— [Steven Schulman](https://www.akingump.com/en/lawyers-advisors/steven-h-schulman.html), pro bono head at Akin Gump, [detailing to the National Law Journal](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202777920852/Big-Law-Among-Those-Leading-Opposition-to-Trumps-Refugee-Ban) the planned response from Biglaw firms in support of the immigrants impacted by Donald Trump’s executive order. Schulman noted the involvement, not only by his own firm, but of Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton, Kirkland & Ellis, and other big firms, as well as the efforts of individual lawyers and firms around the country.

The good compensation news is just flowing in Biglaw these days. The latest firm to announce associate raises is Boies Schiller & Flexner. The firm has undergone some [major changes over the last year+](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/boies-schiller-takes-big-hit-to-2020-profits/), but with the latest announcement, they’re showing they still have what it takes to hang with the Biglaw elite.

The firm will move associates onto the pay scale set by Davis Polk last week, and in the email to associates ([available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/bsf-raises/2/)) confirmed their commitment to staying on top of market compensation. That means associates will be making between $202,500 and $365,000, depending on class year, as base pay for associates in good standing according to the following schedule:

# Davis Polk Is Here To Announce Its 2022 Bonus Scale
## This firm sure knows how to make its associates happy.

Biglaw bonus season sure is off to a slow start, but things finally seem to be picking up a little bit of speed. Associates had been waiting, hope against hope, to see if any firm would be willing to top what [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-bonus-season-begins/) and [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cravath-bonuses-22/) had offered up.

Davis Polk & Wardwell — the firm that’s become known as Biglaw’s bringer of special bonuses — has now made its year-end bonus announcement. Are there any special treats for associates this time around?

Alas, no. Sorry to dash your dreams of additional bonus bucks, associates. Despite the firm bringing home $1,970,000,000 gross revenue in 2021, it’s merely a match. Here’s the firm’s bonus scale:

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015+: $115,000
Associates “in good standing” at the firm will receive their bonuses on December 30, which should make for a very happy new year indeed. Congratulations on your generous bonuses, DPW associates!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.
