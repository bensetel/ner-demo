# Biglaw Firm Gathers Associates For 'Major News,' Then Doesn't Announce Bonuses

This summer, while the rest of the Biglaw world dutifully raised associate salaries to reflect the cost of living increase of the last two years, Greenberg Traurig bucked the trend and spun a song and dance about the economy that boiled down to “[we’re too cheap to pay you](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/greenberg-traurig-explains-why-its-too-cheap-to-raise-associate-salaries/).” The firm later [tried to pay off a few attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/having-promised-to-not-follow-the-market-this-firm-is-trying-to-quietly-pay-a-lucky-few/), but more or less just ate the black eye it’d given itself functionally admitting — not so much that they couldn’t afford this raise, but that it couldn’t really afford the 2016 raise it already gave associates in its New York and Chicago offices. Because [that’s what a firm really means](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-the-milbank-raise-is-not-that-big-of-a-deal-and-why-it-is/) when they don’t offer a cost of living adjustment.

Armed with the knowledge that Greenberg Traurig is absolutely, positively not interested in employee satisfaction if it costs them a penny, associates were appropriately steeled for the bait and switch dropped on them this week.

On Tuesday, associates were called together for an all associates video conference, the sort of drudgery that attorneys go through this time of year because it usually corresponds with a happy bonus announcement. Indeed, the powers-that-be teased the assembled masses on this score with a tantalizing “if you stay around until the end of the presentation, we’ll have some major news to announce.” Well, well, what might that major news be in this first week of December two weeks removed from the start of bonus season?

The firm will be bringing back associate retreats. If ever there was a [one-year membership in the Jelly of the Month Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K8-kNuDgoA) in Biglaw, this is surely it.

So now we must ask ourselves the classic corporate query: is Greenberg Traurig’s leadership team is evil or stupid? For it would certainly take someone with a heart two sizes too small to explicitly stoke associate excitement knowing that the punchline would not be cash but an all-expense paid trip to spend more time with all the assholes from the office.

And yet, Greenberg Traurig’s chronic failure to get through the day without alienating its employees has to stem from a deeper misunderstanding of their surroundings. Do they not see the bonus talk? Perhaps not, since bonus announcements [aren’t flying with their usual rapidity](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/what-have-we-learned-from-biglaw-bonus-season-so-far/). Still, it is December. Can they be so dense as to not realize that the only things that pass for “major news” for firms this month are bonuses or layoffs?

Evil or stupid? You decide.

In order to be successful in law, you must learn how to fail better. Many lawyers become so focused on winning every case that they lose sight of the bigger picture. Real success requires you to take risks and learn from your failures. So don’t be afraid to make mistakes; they’re the only way you can learn and grow.

Here are a few tips that can help you learn from missteps and limitations, becoming a better lawyer in the process:

Don’t Be Afraid To Take Risks

The best way to learn is by taking risks. If you’re always playing it safe, you’ll never truly grow. So, make a point of taking chances and watch your skills improve. If you’re given the opportunity to take on a new and challenging case, go for it! Taking on next-level experiences is how you learn and grow as a lawyer.

Learn From Your Failures

It’s important to remember that not every case is going to be a victory. You’re going to lose some cases, and that’s okay. What’s important is that you learn from your failures.

Try to take the time to debrief after every case — win or lose. What could you have done differently? What went well? What didn’t go well? By taking the time to reflect on your failures, you can learn from them, adjust your approach next time and become a better lawyer.

Be Patient

Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is a successful career in law. That takes time, patience, and perseverance — all things that don’t come quickly. Don’t expect to become a top lawyer overnight.

Take the time to build relationships with clients and colleagues, and don’t get discouraged if you don’t see results immediately. Good things come to those who wait.

Have Realistic Expectations

Part of being patient is having realistic expectations. As mentioned, cases don’t always end up in your favor. Someone has to lose every case and, sometimes, that someone is you. Regardless of your performance, it’s always possible to learn from your mistakes.

Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Just do the best you can and remember that negative outcomes can still lead to positive lessons learned.

Stay Focused On The Bigger Picture

It’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day grind of being a lawyer, working hard on short-term goals and losing sight of the long term. But it’s important to remember the big picture. Why did you become a lawyer? What do you ultimately want to accomplish in your career?

If you start to lose sight of the bigger picture, take a step back and remember what drove you to become a lawyer in the first place. This will help you stay focused and motivated, even when things are tough.

Conclusion

It is important for lawyers to learn from their failures if they want to cultivate successful careers in law. By understanding the reasons why they failed, they can avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

Additionally, it is important for lawyers to set realistic goals and be willing to adapt strategies that are not working. Lastly, lawyers should always remember that the practice of law is constantly evolving, so they need to be prepared to change with it.

Yes, that’s [actually something a senior Justice Department official has said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/can-a-3-year-old-represent-herself-in-immigration-court-this-judge-thinks-so/2016/03/03/5be59a32-db25-11e5-925f-1d10062cc82d_story.html).

Thomas leaves Reed Smith having grown revenue from [$1.152 billion in revenue in 2014 to $1.44 billion in 2021](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/24/reed-smith-global-managing-partner-to-leave-firm-for-clo-role/) and delivered a little over half a million dollar increase in profits per equity partner. He will be replaced at the firm by [Catherine “Casey” Ryan](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/professionals/r/ryan-casey) — what’s with all the nicknames over there? — the current global head of legal personnel.

Seemingly [a smoother transition than the one that installed Thomas](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/06/a-leadership-battle-at-a-biglaw-firm/)!

“This is a chance to take my career and my life as as a lawyer in a new direction,” Thomas said. Ryan applauded Thomas’ tenure, calling him a “strong, steady and inspirational leader for this firm.”

Congratulations to all.

# This Biglaw Associate Has A Nearly Perfect NCAA Bracket

I fill out brackets every year. I filled out four brackets this year, and I was doing really well on ESPN, but when [LSU] won, I lost that perfect bracket. Then I realized I had a bracket on Politico that was still perfect, and then it stayed perfect.

I think at one point I was one of 8 people in the country who had a perfect bracket left, and then I lost out in the Villanova game, so I had 38 correct picks in a row. I think the most ever up to that point had been 39, but right now there’s still one guy out there who has a perfect bracket.

So it’s not so much that I’m a basketball savant, as it’s kind of a Slumdog Millionaire kind of thing. [Laughs] It’s a confluence of forces. I looked at the picks, I looked at the Nate Silver blog, and then I kind of just went with my gut.

She’s gotten 46 out of 48 matchups right thus far in Politico Playbook’s NCAA pool. Hammond, an alumnus of the University of Tennessee, has the team going to the finals.

# 107-Year-Old Biglaw Attorney Dies Of Coronavirus Complications

There comes a time in every lawyer’s life when they wish they could leave their firm because it feels like they’ve been there forever. [Mordecai “Mordie” Rochlin](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/mordecai-rochlin), a tax and estates lawyer at Paul Weiss who retired about 37 years ago, but still worked at the firm as of counsel, was at his firm forever, and he credited the firm with enriching his very long life.

Rochlin, 107, recently passed away due to coronavirus complications (specifically respiratory failure, with viral pneumonia caused by COVID-19). According to research done by the firm, Rochlin was 20th oldest man in the country. He was just six weeks shy of his 108th birthday. Firm chairman Brad Karp referred to Rochlin as a “real treasure,” calling him the “embodiment of the history of Paul Weiss.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Born in 1912, Rochlin was one of the oldest lawyers in New York, and until his death on October 23, he was the only person to have known and worked with all five of the name partners at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.

Rochlin would [spend a few days a week](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/the-never-ending-billable-hour-a-106-year-old-is-still-working-at-the-biglaw-firm-where-he-started-his-career/) at the firm in his office on the 32nd floor signing checks, reading memos, and making phone calls, but would stay there for an hour and a half at most — after all, at his age, doing that kind of work was tiring. He remembered Paul Weiss history with “uncanny detail” and one of his stories appears in the [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/10/23/mordie-rochlin-who-embodied-paul-weiss-history-dies-at-107/):

During his 107th birthday celebration last year, Rochlin also recalled the fortuitous meeting of firm partners right after the death of Louis Weiss, who worked as Marshall Field’s attorney and was the firm’s most prominent rainmaker. Rochlin, who had just been named a partner, sat on the floor of a room with the other partners at the Gramercy Park Hotel to discuss the firm’s future.

“The first question to be decided was are we going to remain as a firm despite the enormous loss of Louis Weiss,” Rochlin said. He said Simon H. Rifkind, a former federal judge who’d joined the firm earlier that year, was critical in making the case the firm could carry forward.

“It was a tremendous event in my life and the life of the firm,” Rochlin said.

At his last birthday celebration, Rochlin said, “Without the firm, I would have probably shriveled up somewhere in a nursing home and have long been put away.”

# 'Muffy, He’s Murdering Me': Law Firm Managing Partner Testifies Against Lawyer Accused Of Slitting His Throat
## That one lawyer could allegedly do such things to two members of the bar is disturbing.

Andrew Schmuhl

Lawyer Andrew Schmuhl stands accused of breaking into the home of [Leo S. Fisher](http://www.beankinney.com/people-Leo-Fisher.html), the managing partner of Northern Virginia firm [Bean Kinney & Korman](http://www.beankinney.com/), and committing extremely violent acts once inside. Schmuhl has been on trial for the past week in Fairfax County, Virginia.

In case you’re unfamiliar with the case, Schmuhl and his wife, Alecia (who is also an attorney), allegedly plotted revenge against Bean Kinney’s managing partner because [Alecia had been fired from the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/husband-and-wife-attorney-duo-accused-of-stabbing-law-firms-managing-partner/). Fisher and his wife, Susan Duncan (who is also a lawyer), were brutally stabbed numerous times, and Duncan was shot in the head. Both were grievously injured with life-threatening wounds, but survived the attacks. Their disturbing testimony has captured the attention of the NoVa bar since Schmuhl’s trial began on May 16. Schmuht has been charged with abduction, aggravated malicious wounding, using a firearm, and burglary.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Fisher first recounted the tale of how Schmuhl allegedly tied his wrists and ankles with plastic zip ties and did the same to his wife. Shortly thereafter, he said, Schmuhl brought Fisher into his home office and ordered him to go through his work email account, desperately searching for an email Schmuhl claimed the law firm partner had sent to a Mexican drug cartel called the Knights Templar to “put a hit on somebody for $370,000.” It was then that Schmuhl began to ask Fisher why he had recently fired an associate from the firm — his wife, Alecia Schmuhl.

Fisher says Schmuhl received cellphone calls throughout the entirety of the ordeal, and his assailant later asked the law firm partner where his stacks of money and gold were located. After Fisher denied having any cash or gold, things took a turn for the worse.

Here’s some of Fisher’s chilling testimony, courtesy of the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/05/23/mclean-home-invasion-victim-says-he-recognized-his-attacker-quickly/):

Fisher said he thought maybe the man just wanted money, and offered to go to the bank. “I was just sitting there like this,” Fisher testified from the witness stand. “My heart was pounding. I said to him, ‘I may be having a heart attack.’” (Fisher had suffered a heart attack the previous year.) “Next thing I know he knocks me over backwards, puts the pillow over me and he cuts my throat and stabs me.” He said he was stabbed in the left side of the head and in the left shoulder.

Fisher yelled out, “Muffy, he’s murdering me,” using a nickname for his wife, but he said the pillow may have muffled that. He said the man mocked him and said, “What is this, the Muppets?”

Susan Duncan’s testimony is no less frightening. The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/05/19/mclean-home-invasion-victim-intruder-would-jump-on-me-and-stab-me-over-and-over/) has the details:

Duncan, sobbing, continued in court: “I saw he had a gun in his hand. I felt the bullet. I fell down on the floor.” She had been grazed by a shot. The man left the bedroom.

“I started crawling across the bed” to reach a phone, Duncan testified through tears. “He jumped on the bed and started stabbing me. So I collapsed and he got off. So I got up and he would jump on me and stab me over and over. And he would get off. This happened three or four times.” Finally, she played dead and the man left the room.

That one lawyer could allegedly do such things to two members of the bar is disturbing.

Schmuhl, who was found with his wife, Alecia, after police stopped them in the highway as they fled from the scene, was seated in the passenger seat wearing only an adult diaper. Schmuhl will be pursuing an involuntary intoxication defense, and his lawyers will claim that the former Army JAG officer was taking 14 prescribed medications for a prior injury that “made him unaware of what he was doing.” Alecia, who faces the same charges, is accused of being the mastermind of the attack, but she is expected to claim in her own defense that Schmuhl was manipulating her. Alecia will stand trial in September.

Do you have any additional information about Alecia and Andrew Schmuhl? We may use it anonymously in an upcoming story here on Above the Law.

# Maryanne Trump Barry Pulled A Kozinski
## The rule of law is not having a good year.

Donald Trump and Judge Maryanne Trump Barry (ED Jones/AFP/Getty Images).

The president’s sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, apparently left her seat on the Third Circuit earlier this year. Barry pulled off her February retirement without much fanfare, but people started to notice the judge’s absence this week. The 82-year-old judge apparently decided it was time to step aside, enjoy a blissful retirement, and squelch an investigation into her family’s long history of financial… issues.

Specifically, the NY Times’ report that built a detailed case that [Fred Trump broke all sorts of tax laws](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/3/17934360/trump-taxes-illegal-new-york-times-expose) to set up his kids — including Judge Barry and the current president — with a tidy fortune. The president’s attorneys have branded the report defamatory. The president’s attorneys have not taken any action over this claim because, you know, “discovery.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Now, the government can’t prosecute someone for tax evasion that took place over 30 years ago, but the courts can launch an ethical inquiry into a sitting judge’s involvement in criminality.

And that’s what was happening and almost certainly why Judge Barry is now former Judge Barry. The court informed a complainant that the matter was [being looked into](https://www.vox.com/2019/4/11/18306167/maryanne-trump-barry-tax-returns-trump) as of February 1. She resigned on February 11, rendering the investigation moot.

If this move looks familiar, it’s because we saw the exact same maneuver when then-Judge Alex Kozinski bailed on his job to [squelch an investigation into sexual misconduct](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/breaking-judge-kozinski-is-retiring/).

Three cheers for the rule of law.

How many federal judges are we at now where a recent “retirement” has prevented investigation/punishment & and they’re still receiving a full pension?
– Maryanne Barry
– Alex Kozinski
– Richard Roberts
– Any others?

This is not a good look, [@uscourts](https://twitter.com/uscourts?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).

— Fix the Court (@FixTheCourt) [April 11, 2019](https://twitter.com/FixTheCourt/status/1116137825613877250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Oh, right. Let’s not forget that judges who preemptively resign in order to short-circuit investigations that could result in their impeachment [still get to hold onto their full pension](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/senator-pissed-basically-nothing-bad-happens-to-retired-federal-judges-accused-of-sexual-harassment/)! The taxpayers are still on the hook for paying a multimillionaire — potentially garnered through malfeasance — for life because she had the foresight to walk away before the investigation could get rolling.

America has truly been rendered great again.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Announces Additional Special Bonuses For Some Associates
## Is this the way that extra cash will flow through Biglaw this bonus season?

Biglaw bonus season is nearly upon us, and the lateral market is hot, hot, hot. Associates are expecting bigger and better year-end bonuses than ever before, and they know if they don’t receive them, they’ll be happily welcomed at another firm that may be more willing to show them the money.

As far as special bonuses are concerned, however, associates don’t think they’ll be seeing them again. We released the results of our [annual bonus survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaw-associates-expecting-bigger-better-bonuses-after-wild-year-of-billables/) just yesterday, and a little more than 55% of respondents reported that they do not believe any additional special bonuses will be offered. One firm just decided to blow associates’ expectations out of the water when it comes to special bonuses — but there’s a catch.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Last night, Paul Weiss informed all associates and counsel of a discretionary special bonus program, the key word there being discretionary.

In a memo announcing the special bonuses, chairman Brad Karp provided the details on those who may be eligible to receive them:

This special bonus is in addition to our class-year salaries and bonuses. It is designed to provide an additional reward for those associates and counsel who exhibited exceptional commitment in support of our firm and our clients during the first six months of 2021. Another special bonus payment for exceptional commitment covering the second half of 2021 will be distributed early next year.

Those receiving this special bonus will be notified by your practice group leaders the week of November 8th, and the payment will be reflected in your November 15th paycheck.

That’s right, Paul Weiss is offering associates and counsel two rounds of special bonus payments for extraordinary performance. It looks like congratulations are in order for some lawyers at the firm… but not all.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“They are doing it on a group by group basis like Skadden to make it harder to copy,” reports an insider at the firm. If you recall, Skadden has reportedly been [handing out retention bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-skadden-arps-handing-out-retention-bonuses-to-only-some-associates/) to associates in certain practice groups, but the firm has been keeping it rather hush-hush, with no memo to speak of acknowledging the program’s existence.

Are practice-based and performance-based special bonuses the only way that additional cash compensation will be flowing throughout Biglaw this bonus season? To be blunt, this may be the best that associates can hope for. The existing year-end bonus scale has had staying power for years on end, and for good reason: law firm leaders don’t want to set themselves up to fail if they’re unable to match the baseline bonus the following year.

Associates should keep an eye out for more special bonuses, but until a firm announces a payment grid, they shouldn’t expect them to be universal in nature.

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Paul Weiss.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Associate Bonus Watch: No Chance This Wasn't Going To Happen
## Keeping up with the other members of the Magic Circle.

After Allen & Overy [announced bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-the-first-magic-circle-firm-speaks/) following the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/), it was only a matter of time before another Magic Circle firm would follow suit. And not much time: Clifford Chance just announced a market match as well.

The memo, from regional managing partner [Evan Cohen](https://www.cliffordchance.com/people_and_places/people/partners/us/evan_cohen.html), is straightforward (and pretty much identical to [last year’s memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-matchmaker-matchmaker-make-me-a-match/)). Bonuses will be paid on January 13. We’ve posted the complete memo on the next page.

You know the drill: when your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

# Firm Kicks Off The Weekend With Raises
## Firm with some unique staff gets raises for the lawyers.

Coming in just under the work week radar, we have another Boston raise.

In a [late afternoon memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/firm-kicks-off-the-weekend-with-raises/2/) from managing partners [Charles Cheever](https://www.choate.com/people/charles-cheever) and [Bill Gelnaw](https://www.choate.com/people/william-gelnaw), Choate Hall informed its attorneys that they too would be bumping up salaries “consistent with recent market changes” on July 1. The memo specifically cites a $180K salary for the newbies. Where the scale goes from there is not defined. Each associate will receive an individual memo later, so if we start hearing of inconsistencies with the full scale, we’ll update accordingly.

In a wrinkle specific to Choate’s noted IP expertise, Cheever and Gelnaw note that they haven’t yet decided what to do with salaries for the firm’s staff scientists and patent agents — critical employees in the IP world. It’s an angle I hadn’t considered until now, but IP firms do employ specialized staff that contribute to the firm’s work, and at a certain point they might not want salaries to get too out of balance.

Also under consideration is the firm’s handling of “lawyers who are on special arrangements.” Undoubtedly this deals with part-time lawyers or something like that, but we’re going to pretend Choate Hall has at least one associate seconded with the CIA infiltrating COBRA or KAOS because it’s Friday and this is the 300th salary increase post so it could use a little spice.

In the meantime, congratulations to the Choate Hall attorneys, and good luck to the scientists and patent agents!

Check out the [full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/firm-kicks-off-the-weekend-with-raises/2/)…

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

We hate him. We really, really hate him.

Reuters [analyzed](https://in.reuters.com/article/us-lawyer-election-donations/lawyers-spurn-trump-campaign-in-individual-donations-including-from-jones-day-idUSKBN27531P) FEC disclosures to see whether lawyers were clicking “Donate” at ActBlue or WinRed. Unsurprisingly, the party that is currently [burning down](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/dont-look-now-but-the-doj-may-be-ever-so-slightly-on-fire/) the Justice Department and smashing all political and professional norms is doing significantly worse with the counselor class.

Reuters reports that the Biden campaign raked in almost $29 million from lawyers from January 2019 through August of this year, compared to just $1.75 million for Trump. Those are just individual attorneys’ contributions to the campaigns directly, capped at $5,600 between the primary and general, and don’t include contributions to PACs or party committees.

Morgan & Morgan leads the pack with $369,127 for Biden during the period, followed by Covington & Burling at $240,564 and Sidley Austin at $230,686.

Attorneys at Fish & Richardson, Trump’s biggest supporters, could spare only $11,355 for the President, and they appear to have [hedged their bets](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary?id=D000033704) with equivalent donations to Biden as well. Even Attorney General Barr’s old partners at Kirkland & Ellis only kicked up $10,840 for his boss in the relevant period. Although, according to Open Secrets’ database, the running tally for all employees at the firm is currently at $364,283 for Biden, and $25,202 for Trump.

Worst of all, the lawyers who know Trump best — or at least the ones who take the most of his money — don’t like him either. During the 2020 campaign cycle, Jones Day was paid [$11,806,685](https://www.opensecrets.org/campaign-expenditures/vendor?cycle=2020&vendor=Jones+Day) by Republican candidates, committees, and PACs. The Trump campaign shelled out upwards of $4.5 million of that, with the RNC paying another $3.2 million. Nonetheless, lawyers at the firm sent only $50 dollars (no, we didn’t leave off a couple of zeroes) to the Trump campaign, and $90,000 to Biden.

Hey, isn’t that former White House Counsel Don McGahn’s firm with the 1,800:1 Biden-Trump donation ratio? Incidentally, none of that cash came from McGahn himself, whose only donations [appear to be](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Donald++mcgahn&min_date=01%2F01%2F2019&max_date=12%2F31%2F2020) $2,800 to WinRed and $2,800 to Susan Collins. (His wife [didn’t donate](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Shannon+mcGahn&min_date=01%2F01%2F2019&max_date=12%2F31%2F2020) to the president either.)

Trump’s personal attorneys are only slightly less appalled at their most famous client — but only slightly. The ratio of donations from Kasowitz Benson Torres and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius is about 10:1 in favor of the former Vice President.

“It shouldn’t be news that rich, liberal lawyers in Biden’s pocket are desperately trying to make up for his lackluster candidacy or that every big law firm has lawyers on both sides of the political aisle,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Samantha Zager snarked to Reuters.

Which tells you exactly what she and her boss think of our community. And considering the publicly available information at the FEC, the feeling is apparently mutual.

# BREAKING: Biglaw Bonuses Are Here!!!
## No, Cravath didn't make the first move this year.

Bonus season has officially arrived — and it’s here SUPER early!

It’s actually a bit shocking that Biglaw bonus season is here so soon. This is actually the earliest that Biglaw bonuses have been announced since 2009. But what comes as an even bigger shocker is the fact that Cravath was not the firm to make the first move on year-end bonuses. That’s right, Biglaw associates can once again thank the firm that [brought about the $190K salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) for their early bonuses. Thank you, Milbank!

So, let’s get into the details. What do the bonuses look like this year?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012 – $100,000
Class of 2011 – $100,000

If you recall, these are the exact same bonuses that were handed out last year (and [72 percent](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/associate-bonus-watch-2019-bonus-season-is-here/) of our survey respondents thought this would be exactly what happened). But you may also recall that [earlier this week](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/are-biglaw-associates-billing-their-butts-off-for-disappointing-bonuses/), we reminded everyone that if 2019’s year-end bonuses were the same as last year’s, overall bonus compensation would be substantially lower than in 2018, since associates at many high-end firms also received special summer bonuses. Perhaps Cravath will come swooping in with some higher bonus bucks for associates? We suppose we’ll find out as bonus season unfolds.

Bonuses at the Milbank will be paid on or before December 31st, meaning associates may miss out on holiday gift spending, but will surely have a very happy new year.

Read the full bonus memo on the next page.

Remember when Rudy Giuliani touted himself [as a cybersecurity expert](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/12/trump-names-rudy-giuliani-as-cybersecurity-adviser/) and [then butt dialed a reporter](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/rudy-giuliani-butt-dials-nbc-reporter-heard-discussing-need-cash-n1071901)? If only that was the most embarrassing [recent story about his pants](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/rudy-giuliani-scores-razzie-nomination-for-ahem-touching-performance/). Well, it turns out that his lack of tech savvy may run even deeper than a hypothetical operative’s ties to Ukrainian actors working with the Kremlin trying to pass along fake dirt on Joe Biden.

The erstwhile Trump attorney may be [scrambling for cash](https://news.yahoo.com/rudy-giuliani-legal-fund-bust-224241239.html) and [fending off a criminal probe](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/rudy-giuliani-debuts-if-you-think-i-committed-a-crime-youre-probably-really-stupid-defense/) about his we-don’t-really-call-it-“lobbying”-but-lobbying work, but you can’t keep a guy like him down! I mean, things might not be looking great for him, but he’s still got his old job… maybe?

A quick perusal of [the former mayor’s bio](http://www.giulianisecurity.com/about/) at the eponymous Giuliani Security & Safety includes a curious detail:

Mr. Giuliani continues in his role as Chairman and CEO of Giuliani Partners LLC, a management consulting firm which he founded in 2002, as well as a Senior Advisor/Senior Chair of Firm Development at Greenberg Traurig, a law firm.

Meanwhile, Greenberg Traurig is the firm that not only cut him loose in 2018, but has repeatedly and publicly [reminded the world of this fact ever since](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/greenberg-traurig-wants-absolutely-nothing-to-do-with-rudy-giuliani/).

The firm and Mr. Giuliani parted ways in May 2018, he is neither a client nor an employee, nor affiliated in any way with the firm.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
That was Greenberg Traurig’s statement earlier this year and doesn’t leave a lot of room for interpretation.

So either Giuliani is still knowingly misleading potential clients by publicly claiming to still work with a law firm that disavowed him like a captured IMF team over 3 years ago or the cybersecurity genius hasn’t bothered to update his website bio for years. The latter would seem hard to believe until one recalls that web experts have already weighed in on the [atrocious levels of maintenance on his company website](https://qz.com/1757484/giulianis-security-company-website-gets-an-f-for-security/):

Mozilla Observatory, an online site-scanning service operated by the nonprofit company behind the Firefox web browser, rates Giuliani Security & Safety’s website an “F” for basic connection security, with a score of 0 out of 100. In a suite of 11 tests, the Giuliani Security & Safety site passes just 3, according to Mozilla.

Now that all those election suits have flamed out, this might be a good time to brush up on the website resume. And this assumes that Giuliani Security & Safety is even still in business. Google lists the company as permanently closed, while other sources say it’s still out there doing… something. Though it’s never been exactly clear [what that something really is](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nobody-seems-to-know-what-rudy-giulianis-cybersecurity-company-actually-does/).

But someone is still paying the bills for this website and it’s still touting his connection to Greenberg Traurig, which is probably news to Greenberg Traurig.

UPDATE: And it was news to Greenberg Traurig, who provided the following statement:

We parted ways in May 2018 and anything implying otherwise is incorrect. We have no control or awareness of what he does on his own.

# The ATL Law Firm Gender Diversity Index (2016)
## The ATL Law Firm Gender Diversity Index is the most comprehensive and accurate database of its kind available anywhere.

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to put women attorneys on equal footing with their male counterparts, whether it be through hiring and retaining more women attorneys, promoting more women attorneys to partner, or providing more leadership positions to women attorneys. Despite these assurances, little meaningful progress has been made to improve women’s stature in the law.

How, then, can we truly compare law firms to see which ones have actually succeeded in their gender diversity efforts? While several companies have attempted to study or rank law firms on the basis of gender diversity in the past based on survey results, none have collected raw data regarding the state of the legal market — until today.

We have teamed up with [NavForward ](https://navforward.com/#/home)to categorize every lawyer in the top 1,200 firms in the country to create the ATL Law Firm Gender Diversity Index, the most comprehensive and accurate database of its kind available anywhere. The data in this study is from December 2014, and includes promotions from the entire 2014-2015 cycle (data from the 2015-2016 cycle is not included, as that cycle is not yet complete).

We’ve graded these law firms on a scale from A+ to C, based on total number of attorneys, percentage of female attorneys, percentage of female associates, percentage of female partners, and percentage of female promotions from associate to partner. We’ve further broken this list down by region, with rankings for the following markets: Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Houston; Los Angeles; New York; Philadelphia; San Francisco; and Washington, D.C.

Congratulations to the top six firms in our overall gender diversity stats:

Firm Name	Total Attorneys	% Female Attorneys	% Female Associates	% Female Partners	% Female Promotions	Grade
Ballard Spahr	521	38	51	26	60	A+
Crowell & Moring	461	38	56	22	56	A+
Fennemore Craig	186	36	47	31	67	A+
Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy	406	62	69	50	71	A+
Manatt, Phelps & Phillips	390	33	54	26	100	A+
Quarles & Brady	483	36	49	28	53	A+
We’ve classified 200,000 attorneys — how does your law firm measure up?

# ABA Survey: Lawyers Are Stressed Out
## The survey results indicated that despite the high stress levels, many law firms fail to provide adequate mental health support for their employees.

Survey statistics from a recently released survey conducted by the American Bar Association show that lawyers were stressed out before the onset of COVID-19, and the pandemic has only made things worse. Of course, that’s not surprising since it’s safe to say that the effects of the pandemic have stressed out just about everyone one way or another!

The survey at issue — the Profile of the Profession 2021 — compiles data collected by the ABA from a number of different surveys, most of which were conducted in 2020 and 2021. In [the report](https://www.abalegalprofile.com/), you’ll find statistics on a host of issues relating to the legal profession, including lawyer demographics, the pandemic and its impact on the practice of law, lawyers’ perspectives on retirement and the future, and much more.

Because the pandemic continues to impact the legal industry and the lives and practices of lawyers, the data regarding the stress and well-being of legal professionals was of particular interest. We all know that the practice of law can be anxiety-inducing in and of itself, and as you’ll see below, the uncertainties of the pandemic have only served to exacerbate stress levels for attorneys.

Pandemic-Related Stress

First, let’s take a look at how the pandemic has affected the overall well-being of lawyers. The lawyers surveyed were asked whether the pandemic had added to their work stress levels, and more than a third (40%) reported that their overall work-related stress levels had increased.

Notably, and in line with an oft-reported pandemic trend, people of color were disproportionately affected by the pandemic’s impact, with 48% of lawyers of color sharing that work-related stressors had increased.

Similarly, the responses to this question varied significantly between men and women. More than half (52%) of women lawyers shared that their stress levels had increased, whereas only 34 percent of men did so.

Overall Stress

The disparity between women and men isn’t surprising since the survey results also showed that overall, even before the pandemic, women reported higher stress levels. Specifically, two-thirds of women (67%) reported moderate or severe stress compared with less than half of men (49%). As a result, more women than men felt burned out due to the practice of law, with 24 percent of women sharing that they’d considered leaving the legal profession due to mental health problems, burnout or stress, compared to only 17 percent of men.

The survey results also showed that the pressures of practicing law, some of which are self-imposed, can take their toll and lead to burnout. For example, when lawyers were asked to describe their work week and how they approached time off, the data showed that lawyers rarely cut themselves a break:

- 38% said they often work long hours
- 9% said they “never stop working”
- 25% said they failed to take adequate breaks during the workday
- 32% said they feel pressure to not take vacation time.
Given those responses, it’s no wonder that lawyers have high levels of burnout. Unfortunately, the survey results indicated that despite the high stress levels, many law firms fail to provide adequate mental health support for their employees. In fact, only a little more than half (56%) of lawyers surveyed agreed that their employers supported their mental health needs. One example of a failure to support lawyers is shown by the fact that only 26 percent of survey respondents reported that their law firm provides information on 12-step programs or other mental health resources.

Concern Regarding The Return To Work

Last, but not least, as discussed above, the pandemic has only added to lawyers’ stress levels. Most recently, concerns have centered around returning to in-office work.

The future return to the office was a source of conflicting feelings for many of the lawyers surveyed. Lawyers from firms with 250 or more attorneys expressed the most concern about the return to the office. Of those lawyers, 71 percent indicated that they were concerned about safety issues related to being inside an office building during 2021 and 2022. Areas of concern included lack of ventilation and poor security in public spaces. Similar concerns were reported by lawyers from firms with 100 to 249 lawyers, 68 percent of whom were reluctant to return to the office, as were 75 percent of lawyers from firms with 50 to 99 lawyers.

In comparison, solo and small firm lawyers were less concerned. Only 42 percent of solo practitioners were reluctant to return to the office, as were just over half (54%) of lawyers from small firms with 2 to 9 attorneys.

So no matter how you slice and dice the data, lawyers are stressed out. The overall effects of the pandemic have only made things worse for many of them, and the recent uncertainty regarding the return to work isn’t helping matters.

What about you? Are you experiencing pandemic burnout? How do you feel about the return to in-office work?

# Firm Announces Raises Coming In February
## Better late than never... another firm raises salaries.

Just when you thought the salary increases were over, one holdout announced this week that it would join the ranks of what we’ve been calling “MoneyLaw” and pay associates the new Cravath scale of $180K/year.

At least for first-years.

At least in some offices.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There’s a lot left unclear in this announcement, but it’s a start.

Earlier this week, [Blank Rome LLP](https://www.blankrome.com) chairman [Alan Hoffman](https://www.blankrome.com/index.cfm?contentID=10&bioID=410) informed all associates via a prerecorded message on a firmwide conference call that first-year salaries in the firm’s New York and D.C. offices would move to $180K. Meanwhile, those first-years working at the firm’s Philadelphia home office will move to $160K. Associates elsewhere will be paid the abundantly vague amount “commensurate with the market.”

That’s the good news. Left unclear of course is what happens beyond the first year. We do know that salaries beyond the first year are influenced by some alchemy of “performance” and “other factors,” so there’s bound to be some slippage from the proper Cravath scale for at least some associates. We’ve seen other firms tout their $180K number for recruiting purposes and then engage in “scrunching” behind the scenes, building a hefty gap between their mid-level and senior associate salaries and those offered by the Cravaths of the world. We won’t know more about Blank Rome’s intentions until associates get their official salary notifications in February.

But Blank Rome confirms that these raises will be retroactive to January 1st, which is terrific news for associates.

As with a lot of salary bumps at firms outside the Cravath tier, the raise came with a commensurate increase in hourly minimums, with the bonus eligibility requirement moving from 1800 to the still relatively humane 1900 hours.

But one tipster zeroed in on the most vexing part of this news for associates:

No word on what the salaries will be for 2nd years and beyond, but everyone is pretty upset that we called into hear a prerecorded message that first years are getting a market bump when a simple email would have sufficed.

Yeah, what the hell, man? And it’s not even a conference call to hear a live presentation. No, they got everyone to call in at once to listen to a prerecorded message. How are you going to pay these new salaries if you’re screwing around like this?

# No, Simpson Thacher Didn't Forget About Associate Bonuses This Thanksgiving

While you were busy trying to engineer an escape from Biglaw on Wednesday in order to garner some semblance of a happy holiday, the powers-that-be at some Biglaw firms were busy finalizing associate bonus structures to make for an even more thankful celebration. Of course, in the case of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, there wasn’t too much to discuss since they just copied the [bonus schedule that Cravath ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/)set out earlier this week (which itself was a dupe of last year’s — and the year’s before that — scale).

But, in any event, here is the associate bonus structure Simpson announced before everyone left to enjoy their Thanksgiving:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
While it may not seem exciting that the bonuses are a redux of those in recent years, you have to remember this year associates at the top Biglaw shops also saw raises. And that’s in addition to the [mid-year bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/) the good folks at Simpson ushered in, so the fact that year-end bonuses still match those of previous years is actually a good thing. As one tipster noted:

Happy they didn’t go down given that we got a summer bonus as well!

# NY To $190K: 5 Arguments In Favor Of A Biglaw Pay Hike

In recent weeks and even days, we’ve received reports of meetings happening throughout Biglaw raising the subject of an associate pay raise. And it shouldn’t be shocking — more than nine years have passed since [Simpson Thacher brought us the $160K pay scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/).

Interestingly enough, partners with say on this subject seem open to the idea. I had breakfast a few weeks ago with a Biglaw hiring partner who acknowledged that yes, it’s probably about time for a new salary scale. I spoke by phone the other day with a managing partner who expressed a similar willingness to consider the issue. These days, the response of Biglaw management to the idea of a pay hike is “tell us more and make the case” — as opposed to what you would have gotten during the Great Recession and early recovery, “NFW — just be grateful you have a job.”

In light of the building buzz, we’re launching a new series called [“NY to 190”](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ny-to-190/). The series title comes from the old [ATL comments](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-farewell-to-comments/) meme; we don’t rule out the possibility of a smaller or larger move — e.g., [NY to 180](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ny-to-180/) or NY to 200.

Today’s post provides five reasons to support a Biglaw pay hike, which associates can provide to partners if asked why an increase to base salaries is justified. Future installments of “NY to 190” will speculate about when the change might happen and which firm will lead the charge. If you have ideas for other articles in the series, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=NY%20to%20190) (subject line: “NY to 190”) or text us (646-820-8477).

1. Inflation has been low but not non-existent.

To quote [Destiny’s Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiF6-0UTqtc), “Bills bills bills.” We’ve been lucky enough to live in a fairly low-inflation environment over the past few years, but “low” inflation is not the same as “zero” inflation. According to the [CPI Inflation Calculator](http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm), to enjoy the buying power of $160,000 in 2007, you would need $183,759.78 in 2016 dollars (basically, a 15 percent increase).

The calculator, of course, is based on nationwide data. The cost of living in Biglaw hubs like New York and San Francisco has grown much faster. Let’s take New York. If you look at [this chart](https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-new-york-rent-trends/), you’ll see that the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment here was $2,120 in July 2009, the earliest month listed. For the most recent month listed, February 2016, the figure was $3,152 — a 49 percent increase.

2. Student loan burdens have risen, along with law school tuition.

The average American, unlike the average Biglaw associate, doesn’t have to worry about servicing a six-figure debt load. The typical newly minted J.D. leaves law school with [more than $140,000 in student debt](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/stat-of-the-week-law-school-graduate-debt-soars/). For many law school graduates, their monthly debt service costs as much as a second apartment (and Biglaw associates generally aren’t eligible for the various debt relief programs available to lower-earning classmates or peers in public service).

Sadly, this shouldn’t be surprising, given how law school tuition has risen astronomically over the decades and significantly since 2007. The [average law school](https://lawschooltuitionbubble.wordpress.com/original-research-updated/the-lstb-data/) tuition in 2014-2015 was $37,725 for public schools (non-resident) and $43,338 for private schools (figures that don’t include living expenses). In the 2005-2006 academic year, the last year in law school for someone who would have been a first-year associate when STB raised salaries in January 2007, the average law school tuition was $28,988 for public schools and $35,431 for private schools. These represent increases of 30 percent (public) and 22 percent (private), respectively. (Law schools might defend themselves by citing the growing prevalence of discounting and scholarships, but this claim is tough to evaluate because we don’t have reliable data on the “real” tuition paid by students at all the different law schools).

So during the 2007 to 2016 period, law school tuition grew much faster than overall inflation (which has pretty much always been the case). Older Biglaw partners might need reminding that the days of [selling a used car to pay for law school](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/01/law-school-professionals-want-bill-robinson-to-put-a-sock-in-it/) are ancient history.

3. Billing rates continue to climb.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

In response to some observations about base salaries I made in a story last year about Williams & Connolly moving to a [$200,000 starting salary](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-who-pays-a-starting-salary-of-200000-williams-connolly/?rf=1), a source shared these observations:

I’d love to see a chart showing the average fee increase charged to clients in percentage terms for associates’ time since 2007. Your stories point to inflation and buying power compared to 2007, but the far more important and powerful point is that the big firms have been raising the rates they charge clients for associates’ time 3-5% a year for seven years now. Sure there are discounts and some firms can’t raise rates like others, but with compounding, the top 20 firms must be billing clients about 150% for associates time [compared to] 2007 but have passed none of that on to associates. THAT is the argument that it’s time for a raise. If I am a client, I would be thinking, why are you raising my rates every year when your labor cost has remained the same?

4. Partner profits continue to climb.

“Why are you raising my rates every year when your labor cost has remained the same?” Because… we’d like to make more money?

Last week we wrote about the latest [Am Law 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/). Sure, revenue and profit growth in Biglaw are slowing — but growth is still growth, meaning that revenue per lawyer and profit per partner hit [pretty much record levels in 2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/2/).

In fairness to the partners, I don’t think this is a case of greed. Most of the Biglaw partners I know deeply appreciate the hard work of their associates and want to see them fairly compensated. And in further defense of the partners, they’ve been paying very nice bonuses in the past few years (moving Biglaw to more of a Wall Street-style approach to compensation, where even junior folks share in both the upside and downside of the enterprise).

I think it’s less a matter of greed and more an issue of inertia. Raising associate base salaries is the right thing to do, but there’s no particular pressure on firms to move right now. It’s not like the move to $125,000, triggered by firms losing talent to startups during the first dot-com boom, and it’s not like the move to $160,000, prompted by firms losing talent to the finance world. Top firms can still get the recruits they want with the current pay scale (partly because, well, their peers are generally on that same pay scale — but see the growing membership of the [$160K Plus Club](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-160k-plus-club/)).

There’s a little bit of a collective action issue too. It reminds me of last year’s bonus season, which [started a bit late](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/): no major player had an issue with paying out at high levels, but nobody wanted to be the first mover and risk being one-upped (or [“Davis Polked”](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/where-are-the-biglaw-bonuses-associate-bonus-watch-day-3/)).

5. Markets outside New York have seen pay raises.

This final point is admittedly NYC-centric — but New York historically has been where most Biglaw pay raises have started, so it does have broader implications. As we have chronicled in [Nationwide Pay Raise Watch](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/nationwide-pay-raise-watch/), pay raises have been spreading to smaller legal markets around the country, including Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, Delaware (Wilmington), and Sacramento. And pay raises are even hitting foreign legal markets, such as [London](http://rollonfriday.com/TheNews/EuropeNews/tabid/58/Id/4084/fromTab/36/currentIndex/0/Default.aspx).

As we’ve seen with [firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/associate-bonus-watch-new-york-bonuses-go-to-washington/) moving to [“unified”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/associate-bonus-watch-a-new-and-improved-policy/) bonus scales, there’s an argument that in this increasingly interconnected age, geography should be less relevant to compensation. But as long as we still have some gap between New York and other legal markets, whether to reflect the premium rates charged by NYC lawyers or the higher cost of living here, it’s worth noting that this gap gets smaller and smaller by the week.

So there you have it: five arguments in favor of increasing Biglaw base salaries, starting in New York and spreading throughout the country. If you have other arguments, or additional data in support of the arguments already raised, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=NY%20to%20190) or text us (646-820-8477). If we all work together, maybe we can make this happen before the inauguration of our next president (whoever he or she might be).

# Baker McKenzie Proves Being A Huge Firm Doesn't Stop The COVID-19 Salary Cuts
## The firm anticipates the salary cuts will last through the end of the year.

We knew this was coming. On Friday, Baker McKenzie — the huge Biglaw firm with over 6,000 attorneys worldwide — [gave employees a heads up that COVID-19 austerity measures, namely salary cuts, were coming. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/baker-mckenzie-announces-there-will-definitely-be-covid-19-cuts-but-exactly-what-they-are-who-the-hell-knows/?rf=1)Quite a few employees of the mega firm reached out to Above the Law to express their… displeasure at being left wondering how big a financial burden they’d be forced to shoulder over the holiday weekend.

Well, the wait is over. This afternoon, Baker McKenzie North America Chief Executive Officer Colin Murray emailed employees ([full email available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/baker-mckenzie-salary-cuts/2/)) the planned cuts. In the United States, all attorneys and business professionals making over $100,000 will see a 15 percent cut in salary. In Canada folks are getting a 10 percent cut, and no cuts are planned in Mexico. Annual raises (for staff), usually scheduled for July 1 at the firm, will not happen. And the firm anticipates these lower salary points lasting from May 1 through December 31.

On the happier side, the firm will establish an emergency loan fund (details forthcoming) for those particularly hard impacted. And they’re keeping the door open for additional bonuses for “exemplary performance”:

We anticipate recognizing and additionally awarding payments to our top performers, as well as to others demonstrating exemplary performance in the face of increasing demands on their time — both timekeepers and business professionals — later in the year.

As Murray said in a statement to the media:

“We all will share in some short-term pain, but in the long term, taking these actions now is the most prudent way for us to move through this crisis as a Firm, with the smallest impact possible on our people and our clients.”

Good luck to those at the firm as they weather the financial consequences of COVID-19.

Four years ago, the London-based [Interlaw Diversity Forum](http://www.interlawdiversityforum.org/) published its [Career Progression Report](http://theapolloproject.net/apollo/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/career-progression-in-the-legal-sector-june-2015.pdf), which reflected economic, demographic, perception, and attitudinal answers from the Forum’s inaugural survey of lawyers and other professionals in the United Kingdom (U.K.). This comprehensive report is the first of its kind to explore the intersections of gender, ethnicity, social mobility, disability, and sexual orientation of lawyers and business service professionals.

This year, the Forum hopes to gather this type of information from lawyers in the [United States](https://westminster.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/interlaw-career-progression-survey-us) and other [countries](https://westminster.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/interlaw-career-progression-survey-eu) as well. If you have a minute, [please fill out the survey](https://westminster.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/interlaw-career-progression-survey-us). It will help us to discover where we stand as a profession.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This week, I had the opportunity to catch up with [Daniel Winterfeldt](https://www.reedsmith.com/en-US/daniel_winterfeldt/), a U.S. securities lawyer and the co-chair and founder of the InterLaw Diversity Forum. Winterfeldt is an alumnus of Fordham University School of Law. He was an associate at Hughes, Hubbard & Reed and Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a senior associate at Jones Day, a partner at Simmons & Simmons, and the head of international capital markets at CMS Cameron McKenna. He is currently a partner at [Reed Smith](https://www.reedsmith.com/Leading-international-capital-markets-partner-joins-Reed-Smith-from-CMS-Cameron-McKenna-06-20-2016/) in London.

Here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): What attracted you to the law and how did you choose Fordham University School of Law? 

Daniel Winterfeldt (DW): My undergraduate degree from Washington University in Saint Louis was in Biology and Spanish, including a junior year abroad in Spain. I wanted to combine a business-focused career with having an international focus, including using my language skills and experience.

I chose the Fordham University School of Law due to its prestigious European Law Program led by Professor [Roger Goebel](https://www.fordham.edu/info/23138/roger_goebel), and I was able to complete all the European law LLM courses during my JD. I was also able to intern at Schering-Plough for my second summer and worked two days a week during my third year of law school in their international corporate department.

RC: It seems like diversity and inclusion initiatives have always been important to you. Why is this, and what motivated you to launch the InterLaw Diversity Forum?

DW: I think most lawyers are drawn to the profession, at least in part, because they have a passion for justice and equality and a desire to be of service to others. This first arose in my day-to-day practice assisting clients doing corporate transactions in New York and London and later exclusively capital markets work from 2005.

I have been out since law school and throughout my career, but struggled to integrate my full self into my work life. When I arrived in London, there were very few out or diverse senior lawyers as role models. This was isolating and sometimes discouraged my thinking that I had a long-term career in the law rather than just a job.

RC: Tell us about how you founded the InterLaw Diversity Forum and what it does now.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Once I became a partner in 2008 and started working with Stonewall, the leading LGBT charity in the U.K., I realized that there was a sector-wide problem that needed to be addressed. I didn’t want anyone to feel isolated or unsupported as I had at times and I wanted to create a path for LGBT professionals to move up the ladder to higher levels in the profession. At that time there were only three law firms that monitored sexual orientation and that had LGBT networks in London, and there were no legal employers in the Top 100 Employers of Stonewall’s prestigious Work Equality Index (WEI).

We rapidly grew and now have over 1,500 members and supporters from over 70 law firms and 45 corporates and financial institutions. We do monthly meetings with networking opportunities, panel events, legal studies, projects (such as [Purple Reign](http://www.interlawdiversityforum.org/purplereign)), and community support and fundraising. Our patrons and longstanding supporters include both LGBT and straight allies such as Baroness Patricia Scotland, Secretary General of the Commonwealth; the Rt Hon. Fiona Woolf, CBE Alderman of the City of London & Former Lord Mayor of the City of London; and Helen Grant, MP and Former Minister of Justice and Equalities.

We are particularly proud of raising over $500,000 over five years for the Albert Kennedy Trust and their vital work with homeless and at-risk LGBT youth. A further initiative by the InterLaw Diversity Forum is the [Apollo Project](http://www.theapolloproject.net/), in collaboration with the Financial Times (FT) and supported by General Electric, Wal-Mart, National Grid, Lloyds Banking Group, CMS, Reed Smith, and others.

RC: For those who haven’t had the opportunity to read the [Career Progression Report](http://theapolloproject.net/apollo/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/career-progression-in-the-legal-sector-june-2015.pdf), could you share with us some of the most surprising findings?

DW: We conducted our groundbreaking Career Progression Report in the legal sector in 2012 with almost 2,000 responses to our survey from across all strands of diversity, which asked for both hard data on career progression mixed with impressions of fairness around key issues such as promotion, advancement, work allocation, flexible working, social mobility, etc.

The most surprising finding was that little seemed to have changed from the 1980s in the U.K. legal profession: white, elite-educated men earned the most and thought everything was the fairest, and the more diverse you were, the less you earned and the less fair you thought things were.

This told us that we had a lot of work to do and that “Diversity 101” wasn’t working, and our key recommendations were for law firms to create meritocratic workplaces by changing culture, training management and addressing social mobility concerns (literally almost all top earners went to Oxford or Cambridge, to the detriment of all graduates from other universities in the U.K.).

We are very excited about the opportunity to update the Career Progression Report for 2016 to see the progress we have made in the U.K., as well as to compare where we are at in the U.S. and Europe.

RC: What do you believe are some things law firms can do right now to have an immediate impact on diversity and inclusion statistics in the industry?

DW: As our work in the InterLaw Diversity Forum has spread out to cover inclusion and to address the multiple identities that we all have within the legal sector, we believe that law firms must focus on:

(1) bringing about cultural change to create meritocracies where all individuals have a level playing field for promotion and advancement;

(2) training managers to operate within this new arena and to monitor and reward success based on established targets and goals within the organization; and

(3) creating a talent matrix and supporting your talent across the board to ensure that they have the tools they need to be successful. (N.B.: Fair support is not always equal support.)

RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

DW:  Renwei, thank you so much for this opportunity to talk with you and your readers. We would encourage everyone reading today to:

(1) Participate and Promote the Update to the Career Progression Report — fill out the survey links below for the update to the Career Progression Report if they work in the U.S., U.K., or Europe (see links below) and to promote them to their colleagues in the legal sector and via social media using #CareerProgressionReport and tagging [@InterLawLGBT](https://twitter.com/InterLawLGBT);

(2) Submit Innovative Projects for Cultural Change to the Apollo Project — encourage their organizations to submit innovative projects with evidence that change culture to the [Apollo Project](http://www.theapolloproject.net/) or ask any other organizations they know doing groundbreaking work to do the same. Submissions are only 1,000 words and full details of how to submit and former winning submissions are on the website.

# In-House Clients Worried Cost Of Biglaw COVID Bonuses Will Be Passed Along To Them In Higher Legal Fees

I understand that law firms need to retain their top talent. That is certainly a benefit to clients as well. The question becomes—and this is always the tension with law firms and their clients—how much, if any, of the bonuses do they try to pass along to clients in the form of increased rates?

— Chaka Patterson, general counsel of Chicago-based Adtalem Global Education, commenting warily on the [special bonuses that several firms handed out](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/clients-wary-of-higher-fees-as-law-firms-give-pandemic-bonuses) to associates earlier this fall in appreciation for their hard work during the pandemic. “There certainly can be the perception of a little salt being added to the wound—particularly if clients are finding themselves having to cut back, furlough, or eliminate positions or take other drastic cost-saving steps—to see law firms so outwardly rewarding people with extra bonuses,” said the GC of a major security company, who offered thoughts anonymously due to a working relationship with some of the firms that had offered these bonuses. “They could have tried to pass savings back to clients, and it doesn’t seem like that’s the way they’re going.”

# Navigating A Path Forward In The Legal Industry
## The legal industry’s historic work environment and structure (fully staffed offices with in-person meetings) will not be as mission-critical going forward as one would have guessed before the COVID-19 outbreak.

A distinguished panel of legal industry experts authored a report expounding upon the results of Legal Decoder’s recent survey on the disruption currently rippling throughout the legal industry.  The authors prepared this report on a pro bono basis and it is available free of charge.  The industry-wide survey elicited information that will help legal industry constituents recover from crisis mode as fast as possible once the dust begins to settle.  Hundreds of experienced professionals from all sectors of the legal industry participated in Legal Decoder’s survey and shared their views on short-term and longer-term forecasts for the legal industry; increases/decreases in volume of work by practice area; and strategic priorities for legal industry organizations. In the report, Ms. Corey, Ms. Krow, Prof. Rapoport, and Mr. Tiano have highlighted how the survey results can inform decision-making and facilitate transparency throughout the entire legal industry.  Armed with empirical data, this report provides keen insights that should afford readers meaningful perspective as we all navigate a path forward for our businesses and our law firms and has been geared towards all legal constituents whether at law firms, in-house legal departments, legal industry vendors, academics, law students, and regulators and judges alike.

# Behold: The First Firm To Crack $3 Billion In Revenue
## That's a lot of billable hours.

For any Biglaw firm interested in taking over the top spot in the Am Law 100, Latham & Watkins has thrown down the gauntlet: $3 billion in revenue.

The current #1 firm looks poised to reclaim the throne on the back of $3.064 billion in revenue in 2017, as[ reported by](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/sites/americanlawyer/2018/02/22/latham-breaks-3-billion-barrier-after-another-banner-year/) Law.com, on the back of a ~7 percent increase in attorney headcount. Profits per partner were also up at Latham to $3.25 million.

The firm’s management stressed there was a lot of strategic thinking that went into the accomplishment, and they’re poised to grow even more:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
LeeAnn Black, the firm’s chief operating officer, said she plans to talk at an upcoming Latham partners’ meeting about how the firm accomplished its “1-2-3” punch of reaching the $1 billion revenue mark in 2003, the $2 billion mark in 2007, and now the $3 billion mark.

“It was a lot of strategic thought and effort and execution to actually get all the pieces in place,” Black said in an interview. “And now we have this wonderful opportunity in front of us to take advantage of it, and we’re starting to see significant benefits.”

London-based vice chair Richard Trobman agreed that the firm was poised to keep building on its recent growth: “We’re convinced that we’ve only begun to benefit from all the investment that we’ve put in over the years,” he said.

Financial data for Biglaw firms’ 2017 results is being collected by ALM in advance of their annual ranking. So far, [nine other firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/which-biglaw-firms-joined-the-billion-dollar-revenue-club-in-2017/?rf=1) have entered the rarified air of the billion-dollar revenue club.

# A Lawyer That Moonlights On OnlyFans Forgot The Cardinal Rule: Marketing!
## Admiralty law isn't the only way to mix water into your practice.

If your student loans look anything like mine, I’m sure you too have felt the temptation to read an article or two on how people make money doing OnlyFans. Listen, it is very responsible and economically minded to have multiple streams of income. I lost steam after realizing nobody in their right mind would pay anything north of 32 cents to look at my crusty feet pics. Thankfully, there are a couple of JDs out there with the assets, footsets, and everything in between to guarantee that gilded stream of additional income we’re all looking for. Stream being the operative word here. Because the niche stuff is where the real money is. And some people are very into water. From [RollOnFriday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-lawyer-city-firm-moonlights-fetish-porn-star):

[A] solicitor at one City firm has…starred in a series of fetish videos in which she has litres of water shot up her bum.

The lawyer pursues her extracurricular interests under a pseudonym, and RollOnFriday is not identifying her.

Fans who wish to watch the full-length versions of her BDSM films must purchase them from the website on which they appear.

A preview clip depicts a man with a large enema syringe injecting a substantial quantity of water into the lawyer’s bottom while she lies tied to a board. Viewers can keep track of the volume of liquid in play via a helpful on-screen display. Once the solicitor reaches capacity she then expels the fluid at high speed across the dungeon floor. So, not too different from the day job.

My take on this? I know lawyers like their anonymity and non-disclosure agreements, but any publicity is good publicity! Who in the hell is doing this? Unless their OnlyFans handle is WetEsquire, they’re missing out on a bunch of potential referrals! Remember readers — if you are going to do the work, make sure there are as few roadblocks to you getting paid at the end of it as possible! These are the types of things that are patently obvious if you go for a joint JD/Business program.

Do you believe in magic? The folks at Linklaters do because they’re making money appear for US associates.

Number 16 on the G200 with a whopping $2,350,490,000 in revenue, Linklaters informed the team that it would pay NY market bonuses on December 29. While the firm didn’t break it down, as a reminder these are the numbers we’re talking about:

Class	Bonus

Class of 2022	$20K
Class of 2021	$30K
Class of 2020	$57.5K
Class of 2019	$75K
Class of 2018	$90K
Class of 2017	$105K
Class of 2016+	$115K
Meanwhile, the firm also announced that its salaries would bump up to meet the new normal as well:

Class	Bonus
Class of 2023	$225K
Class of 2022	$235K
Class of 2021	$260K
Class of 2020	$310K
Class of 2019	$365K

# The First CLE Provider To Require Vaccinations For In-Person Program Attendance
## Health safety is important when it comes to reopening plans, and vaccination is key.

As the legal profession attempts to work its way back into the office, the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 continues to pose problems. Many law firms have pushed back their return-to-office dates, and many others have mandated vaccinations for all employees. When we do finally round the bend and commence with our “post-pandemic” way of life, lawyers will likely be expected to resume attendance at in-person CLE programming to remain in good standing with their state bars.

If the concept of attending an in-person CLE event seems a little nervewracking right now, we don’t blame you one bit. Attorneys and faculty alike want to know that they’ll be safe from harm. Thankfully, PLI, one of the oldest CLE providers around, knows how you feel, and wants to protect lawyers’ health as best they can.

About 95% of the Am Law 100 (and many others) are PLI members, and to launch a safe return for each and every one of the attorneys at these firms, PLI will be requiring proof of vaccination to attend CLE programs in person upon its reopening this fall. We believe that PLI is one of the first CLE provider to announce a vaccination requirement for in-person programming.

UPDATE (10/4): We’ve been told that the Pennsylvania Bar Institute of the Pennsylvania Bar Association has been requiring registrants for live CLE programs to be vaccinated and masked for all live programs offered since August. Proof of vaccination is not required at this time. Social distancing is provided to the fullest extent possible at all live programming. Thanks to everyone at the PBI/PBA for ensuring the safety of those Pennsylvania lawyers.

Starting on October 1, PLI will be welcoming attendees and faculty back to its conference centers in New York and San Francisco, as well as other offsite locations. As part of its “Safe Return” program, proof of vaccination can be uploaded to the [PLI website](https://www.pli.edu/programs/safe-return) using a quick, secure tool. If people are unable to provide this proof for any reason, they will still be welcome to join CLE programs via live webcast.

Here’s what Kara O’Brien, Vice President, Programs, had to say of the PLI’s plans:

All of us at PLI have missed hosting our onsite programs and seeing our exceptional volunteer faculty, Members and customers in-person each day. We look forward to welcoming everyone back to enjoy all the benefits afforded by in-person learning starting on October 1. Our preparations, which have been thoughtfully coordinated over many months, have prioritized safety and we recognize that the safest thing we can do is ensure that everyone at our programs, attendees, faculty and PLI staff, is fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Of course, any faculty volunteer or program attendee who cannot, or prefers not to, submit a vaccination record for any reason, has the option to continue to present and attend remotely via live webcast on PLI.edu.

CLE will be in person again soon, and when it is, lawyers can be confident in the fact that with PLI, they’ll be surrounded by colleagues who care about the health and safety of their communities. “We can’t wait to personally welcome the legal community back,” O’Brien said. “As we’ve done throughout this unprecedented time, we will continue to evaluate and update safety procedures for our in-person programs based on developments in federal, state, and local guidance.” This is an announcement worth celebrating, and it’s cause for other CLE providers to evaluate their reopening plans and make similar moves.

# Quinn Emanuel Delivers The 'Find Out' To Ron DeSantis's 'F Around'
## Norwegian Cruise Lines is having none of this nonsense.

Ron DeSantis thinks he’s going to be president. It’s unclear why he thinks the Republican nominee is going to be anyone not named “Trump,” but he’s pretty sure he can swing it if he stays well within the rails of the crazy train long enough to earn an endorsement. Assuming Donald Trump isn’t going to flex his Grover Cleveland muscle.

If the big guy does stand down, then think of DeSantis as locked in a three-year primary with Don Jr. for Trump’s love where the coin of the realm is “owning the libs no matter what the cost.”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
DeSantis already passed [a flagrantly unconstitutional social media law](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210524/10240046862/florida-man-signs-blatantly-corrupt-unconstitutional-social-media-bill-cementing-florida-as-tech-laughing-stock.shtml) to ingratiate himself to the class of morons who think “free speech” means “[private actors must give my voice special treatment](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/jonathan-turley-attacks-above-the-law-because-cancel-culture-something-something/)” and lit any hope of his state becoming a tech hub on fire in the process.

Now he’s decided to bite the hand that feeds the state by declaring war on cruise lines who want to get back to — pun fully intended — full steam ahead. As cruise lines are floating petri dishes and manage to pull off their business by taking every reasonable step to keep disease at bay, the industry has a vested interest in a vaccine passport system to limit passengers to the lowest possible risk actors. It’s the only way they can get back to filling every cabin and holding every limbo party.

[DeSantis banned vaccine requirements](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-desantis-cruise-ships-vaccine-passports-20210528-n7jed5ukszchpizifs534iorhi-story.html) and instituted a $5,000 penalty to any business that asks for proof of vaccination. Despite begging from the cruise industry, DeSantis held firm with his plan to [self-immolate his state’s health](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2021/07/12/florida-covid-19-cases-spike-positivity-rate-rises-above-7-percent) in the name of currying favor with GOP donors.

Now he’s about to find out.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Norwegian Cruise Lines, through its counsel Quinn Emanuel, [sued Florida](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/07/NCL.pdf) for actively jacking its whole business model in the name of trolling.

Did you wonder why Florida thought it could target cruise lines that operate in international waters out of ports regulated by the federal government? WE DID TOO! It seems as though the federal regulations here more than occupy the space, rendering Florida’s law a non-sequitur. Did you think that a statute that forces private actors to expose themselves without consent to dangerous medical situations raised due process concerns? BECAUSE THE REAL LAWYERS DID! Were you reading about this bill and thinking it raised Dormant Commerce Clause issues? Well, no, you probably weren’t because no one has thought about the dormant commerce clause since law school, but QUINN WAS ON TOP OF IT!

This bill was stupid when proposed and it’s stupid now. Good for Norwegian to force the issue with this chump.

Unfortunately, we all know where this is going. It’s a rigged game. As soon as Florida loses this case, DeSantis begins the “oh, the courts are so biased against us” whining and manages to get full credit for championing the inane law without feeling the sting of its blowback. In three years, he’ll actively tout tourism’s recovery without ever getting called out for his attempt to run the industry into a metaphorical iceberg.

But maybe getting tagged as a loser will derail his hopes in the Trump orbit where “always look like you’re winning” is everything. If he does lose, at least once he’s out of public life he can enjoy a long cruise.

Which Biglaw firm was ranked #1 in the Vault’s 2020 practice area rankings in the area of tax?

Hint: The firm was founded in New York in 1948 by three men whose names are still on top of the masthead. Two more attorneys got the distinction of name partner in 1960.

# Get Ready For 'Aggressive' Biglaw Rate Hikes In 2022
## Everything costs more now -- even legal services!

For some firms, this will be a historic opportunity to make progress on rates. That’s especially true for firms that are lagging behind their peers. Most law firm leaders completely get this, but many rank-and-file partners react negatively to the idea of rate increases, let alone aggressive rate increases.

— [Kent Zimmermann](https://www.consultzg.com/people/kent-zimmermann/), a law firm consultant with the Zeughauser Group, explaining that some Biglaw firms may [boost their rates by 5% to 10%, or more](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/11/03/aggressive-rate-hikes-expected-in-2022-as-demand-surges-and-supply-lags/), in early 2022, due to surging demand for legal services. Firms that don’t raise their rates, he said, will be at a disadvantage. “People in their day-to-day lives are seeing prices going up for many things they need: food, gasoline, rental cars,” Zimmermann said. “Inflationary trends don’t hurt and might help set the stage for aggressive rate increases for law firms.”

# Grading All The Davis Polk Gift Bonuses
## We knew they were offering associates a choice of great gifts, let's see what's on the menu!

If you listen to the Thinking Like A Lawyer podcast every week (and why wouldn’t you?), you heard [our recent discussion](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/who-wins-the-jingle-war-cellino-or-barnes/) of Davis Polk’s “gift bonuses.” Instead of resting on their laurels as the [Biglaw firm bonus champion of 2020](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/davis-polk-comes-out-on-top-as-2020s-biglaw-bonus-champion/), DPW went the extra mile and offered associates [a selection of gifts or experiences of roughly $1,500 each](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-tells-associates-thank-you-with-extra-special-gifts/).

It’s a great idea! Cash might always reign supreme, but big bonuses often disappear directly into student loan payments and can leave lawyers feeling a little empty. With gift packages — that most importantly do not trade off with the normal bonus — attorneys are forced to do a little something for themselves and that’s a big deal after a year that stretched employee wellness to the breaking point.

Anyway, on the show we asked Davis Polk insiders to let us see the full range of options available so we could offer our commentary and y’all delivered. So let’s start breaking down Davis Polk’s offerings.

Peloton… But For Your Wall:



JOE: This seems to be the hottest thing in sports right now, but without the [problematic worried face woman](https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a30172338/peloton-girl-commercial-meme-explanation/). For me, this feels like having the Evil Queen’s mirror on your wall, but every time you ask who’s the fairest it responds, “not you, now drop and give me 20” but I might not be the ideal audience for exercise culture. This is a B+ for me — solid option but not everyone’s cup of tea.

KATHRYN: A- Nothing is going to be everyone’s “cup of tea” — that’s why there are 13 options! But not only is The Mirror trendy (and one with a relatively small footprint that’s appropriate for apartment living), it’s perfect for the COVID life. Like, even if gyms are open, do you want to go to one and wear a mask while working out? No? Hey, here’s a Mirror.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Still, I’m putting this package on the low end. I’m sure that’s all high end equipment, but it just doesn’t feel as luxurious as some of these other packages. This is a C.

KATHRYN: I’ll agree it doesn’t feel quite as generous, but in my grade inflationary way, I’ll give it a B. But I will also say that one person’s “work out gear” is another’s “loungewear” and upgrading my personal loungewear collection has been one of the few bright spots of 2020/21.

Bill It To Client Development:



JOE: I’d need a little bit more clarity on what constitutes a “memorable course” but could you imagine a golfhead getting a chance to go to, say, Pebble Beach or something? That’s got to be the ultimate trip for someone. So I’ll give it an A because for the right audience this is a dream come true making it a wonderful option.

KATHRYN: Ugh, I guess it might be someone’s dream, so A-. But I can think of many more sporting events I’d personally enjoy more. It seems like a nudge to tell associates, hey, this is also good to schmooze clients.

JOE: I don’t know. Golf is a reasonably popular activity beyond just schmoozing. Obviously, you and I would rather go to the Monaco Grand Prix or something, but people really worship these courses. Commercials call them “hallowed ground” which I think is more appropriate for a place like the Rose Bowl but I get it.

The TV You’ll Never Be Home To Watch:



JOE: My only quibble here is that I’d hope a Biglaw associate has already invested in a solid entertainment system. When I got my first Biglaw paycheck, I immediately purchased a high-end TV and speaker system. Frankly, the latter is a must get for newly affluent associates because while television technology continues to rapidly evolve, an elite set of speakers can last decades as long as you’re upgrading the receiver and keeping the cables in good shape. This is a B- because it’s nice, but I don’t know if it’s an option worth using your pick on.

KATHRYN: B+. It is nice, and working from home all the time probably made some folks realize that their seldom-used system was not up to par when used constantly. And even post-COVID working from home will still be a thing, so a worthwhile investment and pretty good timing on the upgrade.

Since Every Movie Theater Is Out Of Business Now:



JOE: I hated this one until I remembered that not every attorney lives in New York. A 120″ outdoor screen is pretty useless in a studio apartment in a luxury high-rise. But if you have a backyard this is a great gift. Just remember that the projector is useless until it gets legitimately dark outside. No amount of retail projector lumens will overcome even overcast sunlight. Honestly, this might be worth it for the popcorn popper alone. It fits one of my rules for a good gift — something the recipient likes but would never buy for themselves because they’d always talk themselves out of it. Going with a B here because it’s a C if you’re in the city but an A- if you’ve got space.

KATHRYN: Yes, the city mouse/country mouse dichotomy is real. But, Davis Polk is a ginormous firm and there are lots of other options, so A-.

Build Your Own Ribwich:



JOE: I’m not sure the value is here compared to some of the other packages. Depending on the size of that smoker, the equipment involved isn’t approaching the $1,500 value. St. Louis BBQ lessons from professionals is a big deal if that’s your thing, but I’ve always leaned toward Kansas City on this question. It’s good, but maybe buy this on your own and use the free gift elsewhere. Another B, I think.

KATHRYN: BBQ is an art, and lessons from a master sounds amazing. A-.

Obligatory Option For Foodies:



JOE: Le Creuset has gotten to the point that the Dutch Oven might be worth $1,500 alone. Still, I’m not sure about this. The pandemic is coming to an end allowing you to hit the town again, but for now ordering takeout from fine dining establishments seems like a waste. It’s not going to taste right because those restaurants really don’t make their food to travel as Defector’s Drew Magary pointed out recently. Still, this is an B+ because the true food nuts will love it but you’re probably better off with other options.

KATHRYN: At first I thought I was a grade fairy, but no, Joe is a classic tough grader. A. Yes, yes, the equipment is top notch, and no matter how much steam the vaccine rollout gains, there will be PLENTY of opportunities to use that $500 in takeout and sometime, not having to cook tastes DELICIOUS.

Happy Hour, But Classy:



JOE: But what if you only drink wine from boxes? Seriously though, I think this package fits into a weird zone. If you’re really a connoisseur, this is stuff you probably already have, and if you’re a wine noob there’s probably something else on the list you’d want more. Also, who doesn’t finish a bottle of wine when they open one? Do people really want half consumed wine? Won’t that end up drying out the cork eventually? So many questions. I’m going with a B, which could elevate to a B+ depending on the quality of the wine of the month selection.

KATHRYN: A+. MOAR WINE, plzzz.

Billing At 3 AM, But From Home:



JOE: Chalk this one up to “things I could have used last year.” True beanophiles would have cherished this during a year glued to their couches with nary a Starbucks in sight, but with the world opening up, I think they’re going to want to go out for coffee more. Maybe I’m wrong. I’m going C.

KATHRYN: B. It’s not [Jot](http://jot.refr.cc/kathrynr), but still nice.

Post-Zoom, You’ll Need Pants With That Jacket:



JOE: I’ve never enjoyed shopping and that’s why this is probably the number one package from my perspective. Lawyers tend not to be as stylish as they could be, and this gives an actual professional the authority to fix that. And if the associate is already stylish, it’s still $1,000 and someone to chat with while picking out new stuff. I think this is my 1, though I worry I’m being too practical and not really treating myself with this choice. This is an A for me.

KATHRYN: A+. My number one thing to do in the Post is go shopping, in person, and try on clothes, and not have to schlep to the post office when something looks amazing in theory, but awful on my body. To do it on the firm’s dime is just too perfect.

Does This Come With Vacation Days?:



JOE: My work bag used to be a TUMI and it was a fantastic bag. Coupled with $1,000 to travel and this is another contender for top package. Once the vaccine makes the world comfortable, people are going to want to hit the road and vacations go a lot further with a couple of nights pre-paid. Or, if you want to go nuts, one night in the presidential suite somewhere. For me, this is the number 2 option, but I could be persuaded to give it the top spot. Another A offering.

KATHRYN: A+. Everyone wants to travel again. $1K to throw towards the vacation you’ve been dreaming about for a year is a delightful thank you.

A River Runs Through It:



JOE: I’m not nearly outdoorsy enough to rate how valuable this package is. I think if I went rafting it would end up a lot like the time Bart joined the Junior Campers.



I’m going A here because this is basically the above Marriott travel package but for people who get a contact high from an REI.

KATHRYN: I am… not an outdoorsy gal — and I feel judged by people who are. B on principle.

Triple Black Diamond Is The Easy One, Right?:



JOE: The inimitable Slavoj Zizek described my feelings precisely when he said, “You climb a mountain and you slide down. Why not stay at the bottom and read a good book?” Except instead of “reading a book” put “hit the bar.” But I’m trying to be fair and if you’ve decided to embrace the wildly expensive world of skiing, a ticket to slopes “from Lake Tahoe to Switzerland to Japan” sounds pretty amazing. Again, this falls into that A offering for the people who really love this stuff.

KATHRYN: The existence of apres ski takes this from a purely athletic option to a fun trip. A.

Final Thoughts:

JOE: All right, I think if I were choosing I’d go with Nordstrom or the Marriott Travel Package. That said, if I enjoyed skiing or golf those would vault to the top spot.

KATHRYN: Travel, clothes, or wine. That’s my story and I’m sticking with it.

JOE: There’s really no wrong answer and another round of kudos to Davis Polk for injecting this concept into the Biglaw zeitgeist. Whatever you end up choosing, you’re in great shape. Or, you will be if you get the Mirror I guess.

# Most Desirable Summer Associate Program Ranking Crowns New Top Destination

With summer programs right around the corner — in a lot of cases the first “real” summer program since the pandemic began — Law360 Pulse once again asked law students which firm’s summer loving they most craved along with a number of other burning questions gauging what current law students think about summer programs going into 2022.

The survey, [which you can get here](https://assets.law360news.com/1490000/1490011/law360-pulse-summer-associates-survey-2022.pdf), follows up [last year’s findings](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/what-summer-associates-are-saying-about-the-2021-program/) declaring Latham as the preferred summer destination among respondents. This year’s survey of over 1100 law students — around half from the 1L ranks and the rest roughly evenly distributed between 2 to 1 between 2Ls and 3Ls) — has a new champion:

1. Kirkland & Ellis (Ranked #2 in 2021)
2. Latham & Watkins (#1 in 2021)
3. Cooley (#5 in 2021)
4. Skadden (#3 in 2021)
5. Sidley Austin (#10 in 2021)

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The report ranks the top 33 responses (ties are involved).

The top two Biglaw firms in terms of revenue are also the top two firms in terms of summer love. Kirkland’s reportedly bringing on a summer class of over 500 this year, so you have to suspect the firm owes a little of this bump to law students seeing more opportunity. The poll question doesn’t require students to consider the availability of slots, but students preparing for OCI would be thinking about it and it could linger in the back of their brain when it comes to firms. I mean… maybe they haven’t even read up on a perfectly good firm that only takes 35 summers.

To get at that issue a bit, the survey also asked respondents to report where they ranked firms for OCI purposes:

1. Kirkland
2. Akin Gump
3. Latham
4. Jones Day
5. Sidley

Jones Day isn’t even in the top 10 of desirability and yet it’s getting a lot of interview requests. They must be [serving Chick-fil-A](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/09/fedsoc-chapter-offers-chick-fil-a-at-gay-marriage-event-with-disastrous-results/).

As one might expect, questions surrounding the pandemic and its fallout proved the most informative for those of us trying to get a handle on the future of this industry.

After a few years away, most summer programs — even summer programs at firms claiming to adopt hybrid models going forward — are committed to getting summers into the office, presumably for all the mentoring and evaluation advantages that provides.



Still, Kerry Benn, Director of Series, Surveys & Data at Law360 flagged that 37 percent remains a significant chunk of firms wary of calling off pandemic precautions prematurely. It’s hard not to see that as a reflection of where the applicants are:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


As firms move back to the office in one form or another, the figure to watch will be that 33 percent or so that rate this moderately to slightly important. How they cut over the coming years will go a long way toward shaping the future of legal offices.

Benn also told me that most respondents said they were interested in corporate transactional work… which is [a little scary](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/law-firms-put-a-lot-of-eggs-in-one-basket-and-that-basket-is-looking-iffy/). Hopefully this is a reflection of students coming in during a hot cycle that will recalibrate if firms become too overloaded with personnel to support a sagging market. Or maybe the practice area will heat up again and this becomes moot. Either way it’s worth watching.

When it comes to interview success, the report ranks the schools that stood out:

1. Harvard University
2. Columbia University
3. New York University
4. University of California – Los Angeles
5. University of California – Berkeley

I’m always flummoxed at how many students seem shocked to learn that big market schools do better in big markets.

Finally, how are summers making decisions about firms these days?



Law360 created this report so I assume they just fudged that extra 1 percent. We see you.

Again, the report is [available here](https://assets.law360news.com/1490000/1490011/law360-pulse-summer-associates-survey-2022.pdf) with no paywall. There are additional articles providing [more analysis from Law360 Pulse here](https://www.law360.com/pulse/insights/articles/1490011/the-2022-summer-associates-survey) but paywalls become an issue.

# Biglaw Associates Are Apparently Living Easy With Less Work And Higher Salaries
## Average annual hours billed by associates at the top 100 law firms reached the lowest number on record in 2023.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Nobody says life is easy for the lowest lawyers on Big Law’s totem pole. They are known to grind overnight and work plenty of weekends. Partners can be, well, demanding.

But associates have never had it better than they do right now.

Big Law associates have never logged fewer hours and never brought home bigger paychecks. Who doesn’t like working less and getting paid more?

— Roy Strom of [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/less-work-more-money-big-law-associates-never-had-it-better), commenting on the results of the latest report from the Wells Fargo’s Legal Specialty Group, where it was determined that lawyers at the top 100 firms billed an average of 1,551 hours in 2023, the lowest number on record, down 8% since its record high in 2021 of 1,683 hours. Biglaw associate salaries were recently increased to a [baseline of $225,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/biglaw-raise-bonus-tracker-2023/), and as noted by Strom, based on an hourly billing rate of $775, this productivity loss could amount to more than $100,000 per associate.

Michael Avenatti has done more with a porn client than any lawyer since Alan Isaacman. It’s going to be so incredibly lit when Billy Zane plays him in the movie (opposite Zach Galifianakis who will be playing Michael Cohen). Last night, we probably reached the midway point of the show, with Avenatti dropping a bombshell report detailing various payments Cohen has received from companies and shady Russians. As one of my friends said on Facebook, the Cohen/Stormy/Trump/Russia singularity has been achieved.

I have… no earthly idea where Avenatti got his information. But it checks out. Multiple news organizations have verified Avenatti’s report. You can even [read all about it in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/michael-cohen-shell-company-payments.html):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Financial records reviewed by The New York Times show that Mr. Cohen, President Trump’s personal lawyer and longtime fixer, used the shell company, Essential Consultants L.L.C., for an array of business activities that went far beyond what was publicly known. Transactions adding up to at least $4.4 million flowed through Essential Consultants starting shortly before Mr. Trump was elected president and continuing to this January, the records show.

“This January,” y’all. Money was being “funneled” (hat tip: Rudy Giuliani) to Michael Cohen’s shell company as recently as this January, by which point he seems to have been [well monitored by the FBI.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/of-course-they-had-a-wiretap-on-cohens-phone-theyre-trying-to-put-him-in-jail-people/)

What the money was for is, you know, going to be a question for the trial court when we get to that stage. What Trump knew about those payments is going to be the subject of a subpoena from the Robert Mueller investigation, probably going to be relevant to the S.D.N.Y investigation, and will surely be part of Michael Avenatti’s deposition of Donald Trump which now seems like a thing that is destined to happen. (Trump is going to be played by a CGI-ugly Leo and Leo is going to win a Best Supporting Oscar for like 15 devastating minutes of screen time.)

The money funneled to Cohen sure looks untoward. But somebody has to argue that the payments were totally aboveboard. The job of telling us that there’s nothing to see here has apparently fallen to Latham & Watkins partner, [Richard Owens](https://www.lw.com/people/richard-owens).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In a statement Tuesday night, Columbus Nova’s attorney, Richard Owens of Latham & Watkins, acknowledged payments to Cohen, but denied Vekselberg’s involvement.

Here is Owens’ statement: “Columbus Nova is a management company solely owned and controlled by Americans. After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures. Reports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved or provided any funding for Columbus Nova’s engagement of Michael Coehn is patently untrue. Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else other than Columbus Nova’s owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement.”

When reached for further comment, Owens is thought to have said:


Kevin Bacon would also make a good Avenatti, especially since I assume Aaron Sorkin is writing this script.

The argument from Columbus Nova, [all the other companies Avenatti exposed](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/one-of-the-companies-named-in-avenattis-report-has-been-on-muellers-radar-since-at-least-nov-2017/), and Michael Cohen himself is going to be that these were normal payments into the swamp. That’s literally all they have. Everybody is going to say that they collectively gave Cohen $4.4 million — that we know of — to peddle influence with the president, which is just how the game is played. Nothing illicit, just normal pay-to-play lobbying efforts.

The problem with that argument is going to be the money trail, both backwards and forwards. Latham & Watkins lawyers better be able to document that none of this money came from Russian oligarchs. Michael Cohen is going to have to document where all this money went. Donald Trump is going to have to document that none of the money Trump paid to Cohen flowed back out to those same Russian oligarchs.

And given that Michael Cohen seems to be a bad, sloppy lawyer, I don’t like the chances that all of this money ended up where it was supposed to.

In any event, Michael Avenatti has achieved transubstantiation. He’s taken a case about violating a nondisclosure agreement, a case where his client was on the defense against possible damages, and turned it into case that’s at the very heart of whether the Trump campaign colluded with foreign nationals to influence an American election.

I bet Trump wishes he just admitted to having an affair with Stormy Daniels. As Hansel could have told Trump: “Listen to your friend Billy Zane. He’s a cool dude. He’s trying to help you out.”

# General Counsel Of The Oath Keepers Implicates Biglaw Firm In Bizarre Conspiracy Theory
## Hoo boy! Strap in for some *wild* conspiracy theories!

Listen, I am not one for conspiracy theories but I’ve spent a not inconsiderable amount of time trying to decipher this one and have come up with nothing. So, consider this your fair warning.

Kellye SoRelle, a family lawyer from Texas and failed GOP candidate for the Texas House of Representatives, spent yesterday tweeting out some truly bizarre stuff. SoRelle is no stranger to controversy.[ Last month](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/look-which-lawyer-is-leading-the-oath-keepers-now/), she announced that, in addition to her role as general counsel for far-right militia the Oath Keepers, she was taking over acting president duties following the [arrest](https://lawandcrime.com/u-s-capitol-breach/oath-keepers-founder-and-leader-stewart-rhodes-indicted-in-first-seditious-conspiracy-case-in-jan-6-siege/) of leader (and Yale Law alum) Stewart Rhodes in connection with the January 6th attempted coup.

SoRelle also made news when she, along with [fired](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/associate-general-counsel-was-part-of-yesterdays-attempted-coup-hes-no-longer-associate-general-counsel/) associate general counsel at Goosehead Insurance Paul Davis,[ filed a lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/after-being-fired-over-capitol-insurrection-lawyer-finds-legal-work-suing-pretty-much-every-politician-and-mark-zuckerberg/) seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. (That lawsuit garnered a lot of LOLs in legal circles when they [filed an amended TRO motion using the completely fictional experiences of Gondor — as in Lord of the Rings — as precedent](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/hobbit-law-cited-in-wacky-trump-loving-lawsuit-to-overturn-election/). While the case was ultimately dismissed, there was apparently [a split amongst the plaintiffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/__trashed/) regarding what strategy to pursue.)

Anyway, back to her head-scratcher theory.

As [Steven Monacelli details](https://twitter.com/stevanzetti), SoRelle dives into her theory that Jesuits rule the world. Implicated in this madness is a slew of organizations/people including the FISA courts, the FBI, BuzzFeed, Biglaw firm Perkins Coie, and its former partners[ Marc Elias ](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/marc-elias/)and[ Michael Sussmann](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/michael-sussman/).

And while it is true that Perkins Coie’s Political Law Group did a lot of work for Democratic candidates (before it spun off into the[ Elias Law Group](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/the-biglaw-partner-who-protected-your-right-to-vote-starts-his-own-boutique-firm/)), [the firm was also where](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-partner-email-perkins/) Trump appointee to the Ninth Circuit, [Eric Miller](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/eric-miller/?rf=1), was partner before he took the bench. So maybe not quite the conspirator SoRelle thinks it is.

Also listed in the web of theories in another former Perkins Coie partner, Michael Sussmann. He [was charged](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/sussman-trial-must-be-delayed-john-durham-says-because-hes-really-bad-at-discovery/) by Special Counsel John Durham with one count of lying to James Baker, then the general counsel of the FBI, in 2016. Since then, Sussmann has been [at the center of other right-wing theories](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/dnc-lawyer-michael-sussmann-fires-back-at-special-counsel-durham/), so at least this is familiar territory for him.

# Reinventing The Law Business: Goodbye, My Readers

I have now been writing this column for Above the Law for over two years. Indeed, this is my sixty-ninth article. And this will be my last article under the [Reinventing the Law Business](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/reinventing-the-law-business/) name.

While I have enjoyed coming up with new ways to look at law firms and the legal industry (and will continue to do so for my own firm, [Duval & Stachenfeld LLP](http://dsllp.com/)), I also want to share my thoughts on another passion of mine – marketing. It is at the heart of what I do, day in and day out, and I would like to share my ideas with other lawyers. This is something I am quite good at, and I think I could be very useful in helping people at all phases of their careers to become excellent rainmakers and business builders. So I will be starting a new column – in two weeks – that  will be called:

“Power Niche Marketing”

So if you like what I write, you will still have me around. And if not, you will not be rid of me so easily.

To conclude this series of articles – and leave you with possibly the most important and all-encompassing thoughts about the law business – I submit to you the following:

The law business is unique in that there are really “two” customers to satisfy:

First – of course, there are the clients. If you don’t make them happy, then you have a serious problem.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Second – and not as obvious – there are the lawyers at your firm. If you don’t make them happy, you have a serious problem of a different sort.

The question might then be asked, which is more important of the two?  I believe most law firms believe the clients are more important, but I beg to differ. This is because a well-run law firm with high-quality lawyers (i.e., “Talent”) can always seek, and usually obtain, more clients. But when the high-quality lawyers – the Talent – leave, there is nothing left to sell – it is game over.

To paraphrase Peter Drucker, lawyers are so-called “knowledge workers.” They carry the means of production between their ears. If they aren’t happy, they can easily leave.

And this is the essence of the great mystery of the law business. On its face, it is SO simple; you just buy hours wholesale and resell them retail, at a marked-up price. What could be easier?

However the trouble is as a law firm you usually own nothing at all, since there are no non-competes and the lawyers are free to leave any time, and take the clients with them. So all you really own is the desire of the lawyers to stick around.

Which brings me to the conclusion I stated above: namely, that your number one mission should be keeping those lawyers – your Talent – on the team. If you can do that, your law firm will succeed, and if you cannot, your law firm will fail. As Dr. Seuss says, “Ninety-eight and three-quarters percent guaranteed.”

Indeed, I believe in my heart that the reason my firm has succeeded so well, so far, is that we make our mission “ATR,” i.e., Attract, Train, and Retain Talent. When we focus on this mission, everything else falls into place so easily….

I hope this article – and my previous articles – have been helpful to my readers and to the legal profession as a whole.

I take this opportunity to thank [Breaking Media](http://breakingmedia.com/) and [www.abovethelaw.com](http://www.abovethelaw.com/) for the chance to address the legal community through their esteemed media outlet.

I will see you – my readers — in a couple of weeks in my Power Niche Marketing column.

My sincere best to everyone.

# Informed Consent: Practical Tips To Discuss AI Use With Clients
## Clients can have unrealistic expectations about what AI can achieve.

Law firms are receiving explicit notices from in-house counsel saying, “Do not use our company data in ChatGPT or other publicly available AI tools.” As concerns about the inadvertent disclosure of private, confidential, and trade secret information flood the AI landscape, the same corporate lawyers sending those notices to law firms also receive similar warnings from their business clients.

Clearly, lawyer/client relationships stand to benefit from transparent communications regarding when, why, and how lawyers plan to use AI to deliver client services. Below, we explore the importance of informed consent and how to balance the benefits and drawbacks when discussing AI with clients. 

The Duty To Communicate With Clients About AI

While only 45% of law firms expect to offer their clients a choice regarding the use of generative AI, 65% of in-house counsel expect to receive a choice, according to the [LexisNexis International Legal Generative AI report](https://www.lexisnexis.com/pdf/lexisplus/international-legal-generative-ai-report.pdf?).

Informed consent helps you set proper expectations around the use of AI technology. In my discussions with the [MIT Task Force on the Responsible Use of Generative AI for Law](https://law.mit.edu/ai), members agree that legal clients must consent to the potential use of AI. However, some argue that general consent suffices, while others advocate for detailed permission for each use case.

While that debate continues, you can help clients make informed decisions regarding the use of AI by explaining the AI tools used, their purposes, and how they integrate into each workflow. Here are some practical tips for that conversation:

Discuss The Benefits Of Using AI

Share the numerous advantages that using AI tools brings to legal services. Describe situations in which AI has or can help you:

- [Enhance Legal Research](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/from-books-to-bytes-a-legal-research-showdown-in-the-age-of-ai/): Quickly analyze vast amounts of legal documents, case law, and statutes. Access relevant information more efficiently, saving time and improving the quality of your legal arguments. 
- Document Review and Due Diligence: Automatically analyze and categorize large volumes of legal documents. Pinpoint essential information, potential risks, and inconsistencies more accurately to reduce the time and effort needed for manual review.  
- [Predictive Analytics](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/from-it-depends-to-data-backed-answers-automating-legal-case-analysis/): Analyze historical data and patterns for valuable insights in strategic decision-making. Assess the likelihood of success in a case or predict potential outcomes.  
- Contract Analysis and Management: Review and extract important contract clauses, terms, and obligations. Identify potential risks, ensure compliance, and streamline contract management processes. 
- [Improved Efficiency and Cost Savings](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/exploring-ais-role-in-legal-drafting-can-ai-end-the-blank-page-curse/): Automating tasks can significantly improve efficiency, saving time, reducing costs, and allowing lawyers to focus on higher-value work.
Explore The Reasons Not To Use AI

Clients may be skeptical about AI, fearing it lacks empathy or may compromise their data. Explain the legal implications of using AI in a client’s case or matter, including any potential legal risks or limitations associated with relying on AI-generated information or analysis. Concerns can include:

- Ethics: AI systems are typically trained on large datasets that can inadvertently contain biases. If not addressed, biases can lead to discriminatory outcomes and perpetuate social inequalities and injustices.
- Lack of Transparency: Some AI systems operate as [black boxes](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/demystifying-black-box-ai-7-tips-for-lawyers-to-promote-explainable-ai/), obscuring how they arrive at their conclusions and raising questions about accountability, fairness, and the potential for biased outcomes.
- Lack of Contextual Understanding: AI algorithms can struggle to understand the subtleties of legal language, human emotions, and cultural contexts, impacting their accuracy and effectiveness in legal situations.
- Costs: Implementing AI technology can involve additional costs. Ensure clients understand the potential costs to base decisions on their budget and priorities.
Clients can have unrealistic expectations about what AI can achieve, and an open conversation can help you set realistic expectations and avoid potential misunderstandings. Highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of utilizing AI in legal processes fosters transparency and enables clients to make informed decisions about incorporating AI into their legal strategies. 

Many AI evolutions lie ahead, and protecting private and confidential information will remain a top priority. Start now, practicing open and full communication regarding AI to build trust with clients, protect confidentiality, and shape the future of legal practice for the better.

Diversity and inclusion is a journey, not a destination. Quick fixes, even ones with good intentions, will not create the inclusive environment needed for long-term systemic change.

— [Grace E. Speights](https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/gspeights), the leader of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius’s labor and employment practice, offering advice to law firms on how they can attempt to [“create an inclusive and welcoming environment”](https://www.law.com/2018/07/18/5-best-practices-for-improving-law-firm-diversity-and-inclusion/) for all attorneys.

# Stroock To Lay Off Nearly 140 Employees Before It Officially Closes Its Doors
## In its WARN Act notice, Stroock lists a January 2024 date as the time of its official New York office closure.

It’s the end of an era for Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, a firm that existed as an elite among its peers for nearly 150 years before disaster struck. In the wake of [losing more than half of its partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/the-end-may-be-near-as-stroock-loses-more-than-half-its-partners-to-hogan-lovells/) to Hogan Lovells, the firm announced its [plans for a dissolution](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/stroock-to-dissolve-close-its-doors-after-nearly-150-years-in-business/). While the firm has indicated that many of its partners and associates will be joining Hogan Lovells (or one of the other firms it recently attempted to merge with), what will happen to the rest of its employees?

As noted by [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/stroock-to-lay-off-140-employees-in-new-york-as-firm-collapses), the day after the storied firm publicly announced that it would be closing its doors, it filed a [WARN Act notice](https://dol.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/11/stroock-stroock-lavan-llp-2023-0131-11-01-2023.pdf) in New York, indicating that nearly 140 employees would be laid off.



Stroock’s WARN Act notice also states that its official New York closing date is January 30, 2024. The firm’s partners have already authorized the executive committee to “dissolve the firm at the appropriate time” — and we suppose we now know around when that will be happening.

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Stroock & Stroock & Lavan ahead of the firm’s dissolution, which may come shortly after January 30, 2024.

# The Strategic Lateral Move: A Guide for Attorneys Contemplating Change
## Explore the pivotal factors in making a lateral move as an attorney, from marketability and mentoring to firm culture and partnership prospects.

As attorneys progress through their careers, the decision to make a lateral move to a new role becomes an increasingly relevant consideration. Most attorneys lateral at least once in the first seven years of their practice, often due to the realization that the fit envisioned during law school’s On-Campus Interviewing (OCI) process doesn’t fully align with their long-term career aspirations or firm preferences. This journey leads us to ask ourselves whether this is the year to make a change.

Timing and Marketability: The Optimal Window for Lateral Moves

It’s observed that the majority of lateral moves to firms happen between an attorney’s 2nd and 5th year of practice. This period is the ‘sweet spot’ where attorneys possess the right mix of expertise and adaptability, without being too senior, thus maximizing marketability. However, as one moves past the 5th-year mark, opportunities start to thin out due to growing seniority. Given this, the magic time to move is between an associate’s 2nd and 5th year of practice, where the number of opportunities peaks.

Mentoring and Training: The Cornerstones of Professional Development

In the current working environment where in-office time differs from firm to firm, the level of mentoring and training varies significantly across firms. The ability to interact with other lawyers in the office can significantly impact one’s long-term development, particularly for junior attorneys. The availability and quality of mentorship and training depend on factors like formal programs, partner availability, and the presence of a supportive associate team.

Practice Area Fit: Broadening or Narrowing Your Expertise

Many attorneys face challenges in picking the “perfect” practice area, often making this decision in law school without sufficient information. When a practice isn’t the right fit, it is worth considering a lateral move to look at roles that broaden or narrow their current practice or potentially transition practices altogether. Transitioning practices can be difficult, especially in a down market, but firms sometimes retool associates with closely related experience. Regardless of the pivot you are looking for, it is ideal to make this move sooner rather than later as it becomes increasingly difficult with seniority.

Partnership Prospects: Assessing Your Current Firm’s Pathway

The journey to partnership varies across firms. It’s crucial to assess if your firm provides a clear and supportive path to partnership, including opportunities to lead cases/deals, formal business development training, client exposure, and mentorship. The promotion criteria and the firm’s culture around partnership, which includes historical data, are also important factors to consider. Even more important, if you have been passed over more than once despite assurances, it is time to consider a move.

Firm Brand and Client Targeting

The brand of your firm plays a significant role in your ability to target and secure clients. Consider whether your firm is one of the go-to firms for your practice, as this can impact how successful you can be at building a book. It is also important to evaluate if your practice requires lower billing rates. Ensuring your firm’s brand and rate structures support your client acquisition and practice-building goals is vital to your long-term success in building a practice for yourself. 

Transition to In-House Roles: Firm’s Track Record

If transitioning in-house is a goal, evaluate your firm’s track record in facilitating such moves. Firms that see the long-term advantage in having attorneys go in-house often have strong practices in relevant industries, a robust alumni network, and actively market their support for in-house transitions. It is also important to look at how many attorneys from your firm have gone in-house. There are some firms that are a better springboard to in-house roles.

Cultural Fit and Work-Life Balance

Culture fit is the biggest driver for associates to move. It encompasses aspects like group dynamics, office location, work hours, and mentorship availability. Associates often face a conflict between personal career needs and loyalty to their firm. Sometimes, proactive efforts can bring change, but often, a lateral move is necessary for better alignment with personal and professional goals.

Relocation as a Career Strategy

Many attorneys plan to relocate for personal or professional reasons, such as family proximity, industry opportunities, work-life balance, or community environment. Relocation allows reassessment of current roles and exploration of options that better align with long-term goals.

Making a lateral move can be daunting for attorneys, especially when they are “mostly” happy. That said, it’s important to continually assess your career against your long-term goals and job satisfaction. Ultimately, the decision to make a lateral move should be guided by a careful evaluation of your current position and how well it aligns with your professional and personal aspirations.

I batted .500 on my big predictions for 2020.

Three months ago, before the pandemic, I predicted that (1) because Bloomberg was essentially entering the race on Super Tuesday, the Democrats would have a brokered convention this year and (2) a global pandemic would hit in March, instantly crushing the global economy.

Wait!  Those damn editors at Above the Law! I just reread my post, and the editors must have replaced the paragraph about the global pandemic with some nonsense about the economy remaining strong through the election. I can’t believe it!

Anyway, now you know the value of my predictions. So here are a few more, about how COVID-19 will affect law firms in 2020.

(I write these columns a few days before they get posted on Monday mornings. And the pandemic is moving quickly, with events daily outrunning predictions. But I’ll give it a try anyway, recognizing that predictions that I make on Wednesday many have already been proven true or false by the following Monday.)

First:  Litigation is sunk for 2020.

Hearings are off. Depositions are off. Trials are off. Litigators are sitting on their thumbs.

Many clients, trying to conserve cash, are telling lawyers to slow the pace of litigation.

But that’s not the half of it.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The pandemic is going to last longer than folks believe (here on March 25, when I’m typing). I know that President Donald Trump says he’s going to reopen the economy by Easter. He’s smoking something.

The healthcare crisis in New York City will get worse for another couple of weeks. Other cities will quickly suffer the same fate. We’ll be watching Italy and China to guess when a second wave of disease will begin if we release people from their homes, but no politician will run the risk of being at fault for people’s deaths. When our 15 days of staying home expire (here in Illinois, on April 7), the governor will decide that we must stay home for another 15 days, and perhaps another 15 days beyond that. When Chicagoans are finally freed from captivity, folks who haven’t been restricted in their movements will come back into town and start the plague all over again.

If we’re not successful in “flattening the curve,” many people will die in the next couple of months. But if we are successful in “flattening the curve,” then the pandemic will linger for much longer — people will become ill over time.

I’m going to be an optimist here: The pandemic will linger, but litigation will be in the doldrums all along. The year will not be good for litigators.

So, too, for the deal lawyers. Companies are conserving cash. Public markets are cratering. Private equity is in distress. Portfolio companies are seeing supply lines disrupted. PE firms can’t raise money to do acquisitions or find money to do intelligent exits. This will last for a while.

The global economy is getting hammered, and law firms will follow the fortunes of the economy as a whole.

The only practice area in demand will once again be bankruptcy, as we go through the 2008-09 cycle all over again.

Overall, 2020 will be a very, very, bad year for law firms.

That’s it for predictions. Here are stray thoughts.

First: When people are out of work and can’t feed their families, but own guns, that’s a bad combination.

Second: Two years from now, when this is over, someone will do a study of whether this pandemic disproportionately affected the political parties. I’m not sure how this will cut: Democrats tend to live in big cities, where “social distancing” is hardest. But Republicans tend to listen to Fox News, which told people for months that the pandemic was a hoax, and people should continue on with their lives. A good scientist could probably control for those factors and tell you which party suffered the most from this plague.

Third: Clever plaintiffs’ lawyers are probably already thinking about how to sue Fox News for the deaths of elderly Republicans. “Grandma watched Fox News, was told the virus was a hoax, went out to the movies, caught the virus, and died. Who’s fault is that?” Discovery may easily unearth evidence that Fox knew (or should have known) that its statements were false when made.  Causation will be tricky to prove, but I bet the trial lawyers (who skew Democratic and would love to put a Republican-leaning network under siege) will take a chance on this.

Lastly, suppose I woke you up in the middle of the night and asked you this question: “Quick! A person owns a company. Things outside the company’s control cause the company to make a huge profit. Does the owner of the company get to keep the profit?”

Go back to sleep.  A half hour later, I wake you up again: “Quick! A person owns a company. Things outside the company’s control cause the company to suffer a huge loss. Does the owner of the company have to suffer the loss?”

I’m not sure how you’d answer those questions, but don’t you have to give the same answer to both questions? (Yeah, yeah: Maybe you’d have to adjust for tax payments when you think about earning money. And maybe some companies are truly essential to national defense, so you don’t want to bankrupt them in a time of losses. But, as a general matter, don’t you have to find one principal here and stick with it?)

Or maybe I’ve already got cabin fever. It’s gonna be a long 30 days.

# The 100 Best Law Firms For Women (2016)
## Which law firms stand out for their fair treatment of female attorneys?

Women in the legal profession continue to face challenges that their male colleagues have never experienced, despite the fact that many law firms claim to have improved their workplaces to better accommodate diversity. From the harsh critique of taking maternity leave to allegations of stolen origination credits to a dearth of leadership opportunities, at some firms, women face sexual harassment and sexism every day. At other firms, however, women are treated as equals, and get to reap the same rewards that their male counterparts do in legal practice.

Which law firms stand out for their fair treatment of female attorneys?

Hot on the heels of the publication of the inaugural [ATL Law Firm Gender Diversity Index](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/law-firm-gender-diversity-index-2016/), the most comprehensive and accurate database of its kind available anywhere, Law360 released its second annual ranking of the best law firms for women, based on each firm’s female representation at the partner and nonpartner levels and its total number of female attorneys. Many of the same law firms appear on both lists.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Before we get to the Top 10, here’s a brief explanation of Law360’s methodology:

Law360 surveyed more than 300 U.S. firms, or vereins with a U.S. component, about their overall and female headcount numbers as of Dec. 31, 2015. Only U.S.-based attorneys were included in the survey. Firms are ranked based on four factors: the percentage of partners, both equity and nonequity, who are women; the percentage of nonpartners who are women; the split between the firm’s female partner percentage and female nonpartner percentage; and the number of female attorneys at the firm.

Without further ado, here are the Top 10 best law firms for women, per [Law360](http://www.law360.com/ip/articles/784729?nl_pk=16d5aa13-06b6-4f68-87b2-dfb0f1e972da&):

# Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson Asks Simplest, Most Damning Question As Supreme Court Entertains Canceling Democratic Elections

Going into this morning’s oral argument on [Moore v. Harper](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/moore-v-harper-2/), it didn’t really seem like free and fair democratic elections had much of a future in this country. If one were so inclined, the smart money said [the Supreme Court would functionally cancel democratic elections](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/just-an-fyi-the-supreme-court-is-going-to-cancel-democratic-elections-next-year/), or to be more technical, “cancel any check on gerrymandered state legislatures from erasing elections if they wanted to.” That might still happen, but if you took the over on the American Republic, things are looking up.

And across hours of oral argument, Justice Jackson asked the most succinct and ultimately damning question that might save the day. Or at least minimize the impact.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As a refresher, Moore v. Harper is the hook for the Court to enshrine the “independent state legislature theory,” a sort of conservative fever dream contending that when the United States Constitution vests state legislatures with power over elections, it elevates them above their own state constitutions and, consequently, divorces the state legislature from any checks or balances involving the executive or judiciary. When the Constitution says that states “by the Legislature thereof” set the rules for electing a state’s congressional delegation and name presidential Electors “as the Legislature thereof may direct,” it means state representatives and state senators are not subject to state oversight.

Here, the GOP legislature proposed a severe partisan gerrymander over the objection of the state supreme court interpreting the state constitution’s voter protections — the GOP wants to circumvent that. Because, across the country, state legislatures are largely controlled by Republicans even in states where Republicans cannot win statewide elections, this is of particular interest to the conservative legal movement. This case was about a gerrymander, but it’s not much of a leap to a state legislature naming Electors over the objection of a closely contested (or, hell, not closely contested) election.

As the argument unfolded, three distinct camps emerged, with Jackson, Kagan, and Sotomayor opposed to the whole goofy theory; Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas thrilling at the prospect of authoritarian rule; and the Chief, Barrett, and Kavanaugh wishing there was some way to let Republicans gerrymander at will without turning North Carolina elections into North Korean elections.

Neal Katyal went right at the conservatives with receipts — straight up calling his shot, announcing that he’d been “waiting for this case” so he could unload his can of originalism on Justice Thomas — quoting back their own opinions from every time the shoe was on the other foot, prompting a series of blubbering exchanges from the frustrated justices. His exchange with Gorsuch set the tone. The justice asked Katyal for “one example” of the Court employing Katyal’s theory. He cited a 19th century example. “*grumble* Put that aside!” He cited another. Gorsuch rants and raves trying to figure out why he hadn’t researched this point.

Alito concocted a hypothetical about a rogue state supreme court that needed to be brought to heel. Yes… Samuel Alito raised the fear that a court might ignore law and precedent for political gain. You really can’t make this stuff up! Alito is having himself [an all-timer week for unintentional comedy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/fear-of-a-black-santa-sam-alito-goes-wild-at-supreme-court-oral-argument/).

Regardless, Alito’s hypothetical was both irrelevant — everyone seemed on board with some very deferential standard for federal judicial review (Professor Rick Hasen suggests an arbitrary and capricious standard [following Roe v. Alabama](https://electionlawblog.org/?p=133564)) — and missed the whole point. The Framers, of both the federal and various state constitutions, began from the premise that checks and balances are the antidote to rogue actors. The cure to the risk of a rogue judiciary is not to fully unshackle the legislature. Alito strained to deal with this and grew audibly incensed when he realized most of his colleagues weren’t buying it either.

Don Verrilli and Elizabeth Prelogar also took turns at battering the GOP theory, with the conservative justices growing quieter if no less strident as the event wore on.

But amid all the twists and turns from Justice Kagan’s incisive questioning (not-too-far-off translation by Professor Leah Litman: “[So this theory could end our democracy. Response?](https://twitter.com/LeahLitman/status/1600518806664667136)“) to Justice Gorsuch arguing that the independent legislature theory is how pre-Civil War Virginia was a bulwark against the 3/5ths clause (or some nonsense), Justice Jackson delivered the most devastating bodyblow (no transcript… so this may be inexact):

I guess I don’t understand how you can cut the state constitution out of the equation when it is giving the state legislature authority to exercise the legislative power.

Yes. She actually asked this question in different phrasings a few times, but it’s really the only question anyone needs to answer. If state constitutions create state legislatures then how can state legislatures violate state constitutions. It ceases to be a constitutionally ordained legislature at that point!

It’s a chicken and egg problem — except it’s more like which came first the chicken or my dinner tonight — with a single obvious answer. If the state constitution sets guardrails of voting rights and the proper deference required to courts and the executive, then the legislature can only work within that. The GOP argued that, because the word “Legislature” is in the U.S. Constitution it elevates state legislatures above the constraints of their own state laws for this purpose, but no one — original or otherwise — ever entertained that idea. Indeed, it would be absurd to think the Framers, at the time, intended to dictate to the states how their governments should function. “Legislature” is whatever the state chooses to create with all the checks and balances attendant to its own laws — just like it’s been for over 200 years.

At the top of Katyal’s argument he cited the two centuries of election law and declared that it would be “a whole lot of wrong” if “Legislature” meant what the GOP asked for as opposed to how Justice Jackson posed her question.

Occam’s Razor remains undefeated.

Make no mistake, Chief Justice Roberts is on record buying into a watered down version of this theory and will, after today’s battering, probably cobble something together that shields Republican legislatures without straining the outer bounds of basic notions of constitutional governance. But whatever compromise the conservatives try to mold will remain haunted by Jackson’s straightforward question.

Which came first, the state constitution or the state legislature? It’s the constitution. It’s always going to be the constitution.

# The New Hotness In Biglaw Perks? Peloton.
## Will your firm pony up a similar perk?

We know that Biglaw is in the [midst of a talent war](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/), with associates reaping the benefits. The response from Biglaw has been [pretty generous](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2021-associate-salary-increase/) with the money (to [some associates more than others](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-skadden-arps-handing-out-retention-bonuses-to-only-some-associates/)), but they know that [it’s going to take more than cold, hard cash ](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/elite-biglaw-firms-are-offering-more-special-rewards-to-keep-their-stressed-out-associates-happy/)to keep the associates they need. So, firms are looking for the new hotness designed to keep associates loyal.

Enter Peloton. The exercise bike/cult has been gaining in popularity since its 2012 introduction, but the COVID lockdowns really supercharged its fan base — just [ask Joe Biden](https://jezebel.com/jezebel-investigates-who-is-joe-bidens-favorite-peloto-1846958753). If you’ve been living under a rock and don’t know the Peloton schtick, it’s pretty straight forward — you buy this super expensive bike that connects to the internet and pay a monthly fee to take online spin classes and connect with other users. Users swear by those classes and the stats and badges and say it keeps them motivated. Plus the whole global pandemic thing showed folks the real value of an at-home workout.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Anyway, O’Melveny & Myers — a firm [with a history](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/vault-quality-of-life-rankings-the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-in-america-2020/) of caring about their employees’ well being — [announced this week](https://www.omm.com/our-firm/media-center/press-releases/omelveny-teams-with-peloton-becoming-first-law-firm-to-offer-corporate-wellness/) that they’re the first law firm to offer the Peloton Corporate Wellness program to lawyers and staff. As of October 6, all OMM employees in the U.S. will receive free access to a Peloton Digital Membership or subsidized pricing for an All-Access Membership, as well as preferred pricing on the Peloton Bike, and Bike+.

Nifty little perk they’ve got there. As the firm’s chief operating officer notes:

“We’re proud to be the first law firm to team with Peloton, the world’s leading interactive fitness platform,” said O’Melveny Chief Operating Officer George C. Demos, who chairs the firm’s Living Well Committee. “Peloton Corporate Wellness brings world-class content and instructors to our people in the comfort and convenience of their homes, making a healthy fitness routine more accessible for all. We’re pleased to make this valuable program available to our U.S.-based employees at subsidized pricing so they can experience the benefits of Peloton’s comprehensive platform.”

And OMM’s chair, Bradley Butwin, knows the benefits of the program, as he’s a user himself:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Peloton has been a game changer for my own family, particularly since the start of the pandemic,” said O’Melveny chair Bradley J. Butwin. “Peloton provided my entire family with inspirational, efficient, challenging, and fun workouts, which have improved our state of mind.”

With [Davis Polk offering associates the Mirror workout system](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/grading-all-the-davis-polk-gift-bonuses/), are we seeing an exercise war a-brewin’? Will another firm [offer Ergatta](https://ergatta.com/) next? Perhaps the mainstream popularity of Peloton will convince others to given a similar perk. Regardless, you have to appreciate the attention well-being is getting from Biglaw atm. And we’re here for it.

# How Technology Can Help CYA When the DOJ Comes Knocking
## A growing number of companies have come to realize that the right technology for the job is e-discovery software.

Few events tingle the spine of a corporate counsel more than a knock on the door from a U.S. Department of Justice FCPA investigator. We’ve all heard the horror stories. The scariest was in 2008, when Siemens agreed to fines totaling $1.6 billion to settle bribery charges brought by U.S. and German authorities.

What many corporate counsel may not realize, however, is that e-discovery technology can be just the balm they need to ease their frazzled nerves. In fact, a number of corporations are now using the same technology that litigators use in e-discovery to reduce their exposure in government investigations.

Legal departments’ need to address this issue is more urgent than ever, thanks to recent news from the DOJ. On April 5, the DOJ’s Criminal Division unveiled a pilot program to facilitate more robust FCPA enforcement. The pilot’s goal is to motivate companies to voluntarily self-disclose FCPA-related misconduct and more fully cooperate with the DOJ.

The payoff can be huge for companies that comply with the program’s requirements. They may escape prosecution entirely or, even if criminal charges result, they will be eligible for significant mitigation credits.

Here’s the hitch: Compliance requires that a company have in place an effective program that can root out potential violations and that can enable it to swiftly ascertain and disclose to the DOJ all relevant facts about the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.

That is not always easy to do, especially for a multinational corporation with vast data troves spread across disparate corners of the country or even the world.

This is where the technology comes in. Scouring all that data, thoroughly and quickly, is possible only with the right technology. A growing number of companies have come to realize that the right technology for the job is e-discovery software. It is unique in providing the sophisticated search and analytics tools their compliance staffs need to quickly dig up all pertinent facts.

A Case Study

Let me illustrate by telling you about a multinational company that now routinely uses Catalyst Insight for internal investigations of anti-bribery and other compliance issues in its offices in Asia, Europe and elsewhere.

When tips would come in of potential anti-bribery violations, the company would direct them to compliance staff in the appropriate regional office. There, standard procedure was to collect emails and other electronic files from the appropriate custodians and then sift through it all for evidence of suspicious activity. The process was inefficient and the results were sometimes questionable.

One day, a lawyer in the company’s Singapore office who had used Catalyst Insight elsewhere got the idea that it could be a more effective way to search and analyze this data. Insight worked so well that regional offices throughout the company followed suit. Today, Insight is the company’s default platform for all compliance investigations worldwide.

Now, for each new investigation, the regional office can set up a dedicated site in the cloud-based Insight platform within an hour. Then, using Insight’s automatic loading and processing, custodian data specific to the region is loaded from the company’s main servers into the site.

From there, regional staff use Insight’s search and analytics tools to look for evidence of the alleged impropriety. If the initial search uncovers evidence warranting further inquiry, the company turns the matter over to outside counsel to more thoroughly review the data and determine how to proceed.

For the company, a key feature of the platform is the ability to control the process itself without having to wait for a third party to process and load data. An entire investigation—from when the initial tip is received to when it is either closed or referred out—often takes no more than two weeks.

Features that Enhance Investigations

While an e-discovery platform can be a highly effective internal investigation tool, Insight has specific features that make an investigation even easier:

- Automated case creation, so the company can quickly set up investigation sites as needed without requiring third-party involvement.
- Automated processing and loading, so the company can load its own data into the platform and quickly get started with review.
- Robust and intuitive search capabilities, so that compliance staff can rapidly hone in on key information.
- Visual analytics such as timelines and relationship maps, enabling investigators to identify and explore patterns in email correspondence and other data.
- Integrated batching, export and production capabilities to easily deliver documents externally to outside counsel or government investigators.
For FCPA cases, a critical capability is multi-language document handling. In such a case, the emails and documents under scrutiny could be in any of a range of languages or even contain multiple languages within a single document. Insight is able to process documents in multiple languages and, more importantly, search them in multiple languages.

More Effective Compliance Through Technology

Thanks to the DOJ’s pilot program, corporations now have more incentive than ever to adopt strong compliance programs that include rapid and thorough responses to suspicious internal activity. As it turns out, the same technology that litigators already use to quickly get to the core of a case is equally adept at helping corporations get to the nub of an investigation. That could make all the difference in whether a corporation is prosecuted and what penalties it might face.

UPDATE 6/2/16: We’ve got some more details on what set off this altercation [available here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-made-that-summer-associate-slap-a-biglaw-lawyer/).

What we’ve heard from multiple sources now is that a second-year associate at a top Biglaw firm — think Am Law and [ATL Top 10](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2015-law-firm-rankings/) — got slapped across the face by a summer associate from a T14 school. Even the [world’s worst summer associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/08/this-firm-hired-an-actor-to-play-the-worlds-worst-summer-associate/) didn’t think to hit anybody.

Before we go any further, kudos to the summer associates of 2016! Ever since the Great Recession, summer classes have been a little on the dull side. Sure there are the occasional situations, but back in headier times, summer associates were [leaping into the Hudson River in their skivvies](https://abovethelaw.com/2006/11/an-update-on-aquagirl-things-are-going-swimmingly/) all the time. So to have a physical confrontation between an associate and a summer this early in the season shows the sort of gumption we all knew you kids had in you.

Interestingly enough, while we have multiple independent sources telling us that the incident took place, no one is willing to explain why this plucky recruit decided to play Slapsgiving with the young attorney. Maybe there is no reason. Have you ever tried talking to a young lawyer from, say, Skadden? They’re insufferably slap-worthy.

But left to our imagination, we’re assuming they’d just seen Hamilton — the kind of thing this firm might have the clout to pull off for its summers — and Slappy Summer decided it was time for pistols at dawn.

Hey, it wouldn’t be the first alleged time [a summer associate had a gun pulled on them](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/08/ip-boutique-blind-item-when-the-managing-partners-boyfriend-allegedly-pulls-a-gun-on-you/).

Anyway, without further detail we leave you with an artist’s rendering of the incident:

Rosa J. Nunez

“Woke up feeling like I just might run for president / Even if there ain’t no precedent, switching up the messaging / I’m about to add a little estrogen.” — [Lizzo](https://genius.com/16980039)

On Monday, Foley Hoag LLP named [Rosa J. Nunez](https://foleyhoag.com/news-and-events/news/2019/september/foley-hoag-names-rosa-j-nunez-as-director-of-diversity-and-inclusion) as its Director of Diversity & Inclusion, a newly-created role at the firm.

“By hiring Rosa, Foley Hoag is augmenting the resources dedicated to diversity and inclusion across the entire firm,” said Foley Hoag Co-Managing Partner Kenneth Leonetti.

“We strongly believe in the importance of a holistic approach to D&I. Foley Hoag has always dedicated itself to bringing together lawyers and professional staff members of different backgrounds, skills and experiences. These individuals bring with them unique perspectives that enrich our culture and enhance the quality of our work. We welcome Rosa to the firm, and look forward to her guiding our D&I initiatives.”

In this position, Nunez will be responsible for developing, implementing, leading and championing proactive diversity and inclusion initiatives and programs, in alignment with Foley Hoag’s overall strategic plans. She will also co-chair the firm’s Diversity Committee along with Leonetti.

Prior to joining Foley, Nunez served in similar roles at BCW (Burson Cohn & Wolfe), Omnicom Media Group, and Accenture. She is a National Board Member of INROADS, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to developing and placing talented but underserved youth in various business and industries. Nunez received her MBA from the University of Phoenix and her BA from Fordham University.

Foley’s intentional D&I efforts have yielded tangible results: 33% of the firm’s attorneys are female, 26% of the firm’s practice leaders are non-white males and in 2019 they hired an equal number of women and men. Additionally, the last two lateral partner hires were female and people of color.

This week, Rosa J. Nunez was gracious enough to spend some time with us and share her thoughts on the legal industry, how her background shaped her career, and advice for others who are passionate about diversity and inclusion.

Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): Congratulations on being hired for the newly-created role of Director of Diversity & Inclusion for Foley Hoag LLP. Are you excited about any particular activities or initiatives for the firm? 

Rosa J. Nunez (RJN): Thanks for the warm welcome! I am extremely excited and looking forward to taking the work that Foley Hoag has been doing in the space of Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) to the next level.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I believe this is an incredible opportunity for me to make a positive impact, not only at Foley Hoag, but across the entire industry overall.

RC: Having spent more than ten years at Accenture and fifteen years focusing on D&I initiatives in general, are there any specific areas that you have noticed the legal industry could improve upon?

RJN: It’s no secret that the [legal industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/diversity-for-the-legal-industry-continues-to-be-a-riddle-wrapped-in-a-mystery-inside-an-enigma/) remains one of the [least diverse industries](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/diversity-in-the-legal-profession-has-flatlined-since-the-great-recession-who-is-to-blame/) of all. The issues range from the lack of outreach and recruitment of students of color to succession planning and promotion of women into equity partner levels.

I feel that we need to press the “reset” button and start to approach things differently and with intention if we really want to change the status quo.

RC: You immigrated with your family to the United States from the Dominican Republic when you were eighteen years old. Can you share a little bit about your experience?

RJN: Yes, my family and I moved to the U.S. in pursuit of a better, more stable socioeconomic life when I was 18 years old and entering my senior year of high school. We settled in an almost all-white neighborhood near upstate NY and I was one of the few Latinas in the entire school. As you can imagine, this was an incredibility difficult time and transition for me because for the first time in my life, I felt “different” and categorized as “Latina” by everyone around me.

So I made a conscious decision — which I still live by — to not let those circumstances interfere with the future that I had envisioned. This pretty much meant that I had to work faster, longer and harder than everyone else around me. My ambition fueled me. I didn’t want to become a statistic. I wanted to be part of the solution, not the problem.

RC: As someone new to Boston, how would you describe the city?

RJN: Simply amazing! Everyone has been warm and welcoming and always willing to extend a helping hand. I love the history of the city, the seafood and the beauty and greenery of the suburbs. Let’s see how the winter treats me… I hope it’s kind. 🙂

RC: How do you think we can effectively advance diversity and inclusion efforts in today’s political climate?

RJN: It’s no secret that these days society is divided. But this climate has also forced the diversity issue to the forefront and elevated the D&I conversation across mainstream America.

People are becoming more and more comfortable with expressing their views and opinions with others. Movements like #MeToo, Black Lives Matter and #TimesUp, have helped in keeping issues related to discrimination and inequality front and center, which in my opinion, is helping to heighten the overall awareness.

RC: Now that you get to witness how attorneys spend their day to day, is there anything that surprised you during your first week on the job?

RJN: Yes! All the misconceptions and stereotypes that I believed to be true about attorneys have quickly disappeared. I am very fortunate to be able to work with one of the best — if not the best — group of law professionals, who are kind, warm and willing to assist in any way possible. To me, this is priceless.

From the moment I walked into the firm’s Boston office, it felt like home. And I very quickly realized that diversity and inclusion was something that the managing partners really had an authentic passion for and saw that whoever was going to be coming into this role was going to be very supported.

RC: What advice do you have for others who are passionate about making their respective industries more diverse?

RJN: Be willing to take risks. Get comfortable being uncomfortable. Break a few rules and ask for forgiveness later. Know that there will be good days and pretty bad ones, but once embark on this journey the only way is forward.

RC: You don’t have a legal background like many of the other recently hired D&I officers in Biglaw; how will this differentiate you?  

RJN: I am bringing a very different perspective into the mix. As an industry, we can’t afford to continue to take the same approach and expect a different result. By bringing me onboard, Foley Hoag is breaking the traditional mold… and I love it!

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Rosa J. Nunez for taking the time to share her story with our audience. We look forward to following her successes and wish her continued achievements in her career.

# Summer Associate Offer Rates (2018): Biglaw Firms Are Handing Out Job Offers Like Candy
## But which firms do NOT have a 100 percent offer rate? Let us know!

‘We’re getting offers, bro!’

Fall recruiting season is almost upon us at law schools across the country, and summer associates who worked through [Summer of $190K](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) were on their very best behavior in the hopes of earning big, fat paychecks as first-year associates after graduating from law school.

Last summer, Biglaw firms extended more offers of permanent employment to prospective law school graduates than at any point in time since the recession. We’ll have to wait for the official numbers to find out how well firms did this time around, but in the meantime, we know of several firms that will have full classes of incoming associates bopping around with visions of $190K salaries dancing in their heads.

Following up on [last week’s post](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/summer-associate-offer-rates-2018-which-firms-had-100-percent-offer-rates/) on Biglaw offer rates, here are some additional firms that have given offers to all of their summer associates:

- King & Spalding (Atlanta)
- Katten Muchin (Los Angeles)
- Sheppard Mullin (Los Angeles)
- Arnold & Porter (New York)
- Lowenstein Sandler (New York)
- Pillsbury (San Francisco)
- Crowell & Moring (firmwide)
If you have offer rate additions to this list to share or if you have corrections to the list — e.g., an office listed above that does NOT belong on the 100 percent list — please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Summer%20Associate%20Offer%20Rates) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Summer Associate Offer Rates”), or text us (646-820-8477). We keep our tipsters anonymous. If and when we receive enough information, we’ll do another follow-up. Thanks a bunch!

Right now, it’s more newsworthy if a firm does NOT have a 100 percent offer rate than if it does. On that note, please let us hear about firms that are NOT issuing offers to all their summer associates. If you know of a firm or an office with an unusually low offer rate — which we will arbitrarily define here as something under 66 percent, or two-thirds — please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Low%20Offer%20Rate) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Low Offer Rate”). If we hear about any firms with particularly low offer rates, we will investigate.

# COVID-19 Can Cause Lasting Damage To The Legal Profession If We're Not Careful
## Managers need to be vigilant to make sure that they learn lessons from the pandemic and only incorporate positive reforms learned from the last year or so when normal operations resume.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a seismic shift in the legal profession and has changed the way many law firms and other legal organizations operate. Indeed, the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of remote work, cloud applications, and other advances in the legal arena. This column has previously discussed how the COVID-19 pandemic can advance [lasting positive change in the legal arena](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/covid-19-can-change-the-legal-industry-for-the-better/), and other outlets have published similar pieces. Nevertheless, if we are not careful, the COVID-19 pandemic can cause lasting damage to the way that law firms and legal organizations operate.

One negative change that might impact the legal profession in the long term as a result of the pandemic is a further disintegration of the work-life balance. As many veteran legal professionals can recount from firsthand experience, the work-life balance has been under assault in the legal profession for the past few decades. Many old timers point to the widespread adoption of BlackBerries and other smartphones as the start of the move away from a work-life balance because such devices allowed people to be on the grid and accessible around the clock. In the past decade or so, with the expansion of remote-work technology, some firms have even expected employees to log onto work and be reachable at all times of the day and during holidays and other times off.

The work-life balance has been virtually destroyed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since most lawyers are working from home, and need to juggle personal tasks and work tasks throughout their days, there is little distinction between work time and personal time right now. Many lawyers might accept this as an appropriate tradeoff for the convenience of being able to work from home and being flexible in how they manage their personal time.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Nevertheless, as law firms return to the office, it is possible that some shops will not return to a semblance of a work-life balance. It is possible that law firms will continue to expect associates to be available to return emails and do work during all times of the day or night. If law firms eventually return to the ordinary pace of office life, it is hoped that they will respect pre-pandemic expectations of work-life balance, and legal professionals need to be vigilant about this to minimize a further degradation of the work-life balance.

Another way that COVID-19 can have lasting negative impacts on legal professionals is through the spending habits of many law firms. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many law firms spent less on entertainment expenses, networking events, travel fees, and other costs. Of course, since most people had to be socially distant, it rarely made sense to bring people together to network, socialize, or learn new skills. In addition, many of the networking and educational functions that firms usually attend were held virtually at a fraction of the cost during the pandemic. In any event, one of the reasons why so many firms did relatively well last year financially is since they had less expenses from these cost cuts, and the demand for legal services remained somewhat stable.

It would be a shame if law firms decided once things start to return to normal that they would rather save costs on travel, networking events, and the like in order to improve their bottom line. Such events are a great way to meet different legal professionals and others within an industry and can be a solid source of referrals for people who are just starting to develop business. Moreover, training institutes, conferences, and other similar functions can be a great way to pick up new skills, and attending such events virtually is not as effective as attending such functions in person.

In order to avoid lasting damage to the legal profession, law firms should also change their position with respect to administrative staff once things normalize and people return to offices. Support staff have borne the brunt of the pain among legal professionals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. With everyone working from home, it was difficult for support staff to do the printing, mailing, copying, and other administrative tasks that are important to the operation of many law firms. Moreover, since people have worked remotely throughout the pandemic, it has made more sense for attorneys to complete tasks themselves that were usually completed by administrative professionals.

As [previously discussed in this column](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/professional-paralegals-deserve-more-respect/), [support professionals are extremely important to attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/legal-secretaries-deserve-more-respect/) since they help make lawyers more efficient and productive, which can positively impact a firm’s bottom line. Some law firms may wish to keep a lower number of support professionals after the pandemic because of the cost savings of a lower headcount. However, this approach can be harmful in the long run, and hopefully firms will hire the appropriate number of administrative staff once they return to normal operations.

In the end, the COVID-19 pandemic can have a lasting positive impact on the legal profession or it can hurt the legal arena in a number of ways. Managers need to be vigilant to make sure that they learn lessons from the pandemic and only incorporate positive reforms learned from the last year or so when normal operations resume.

# With Great Raises Come Great Increased Billing Requirements -- The Other Side Of Raises
## A month and a half after announcing raises, associates start getting the bad news.

When Crowell & Moring matched the Cravath scale through fifth-year associates, it officially marked the “[what is going on here?](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/crowell-moring-matches-wait-what-in-the-holy-hell-is-going-on-here/)” moment of raise-a-palooza. This was no longer an overdue market correction where Cravath, S&C, Simpson, Davis Polk, Cleary, etc. recognized that firms across the country had reached $160K and it was time to recreate some daylight between the top-tier firms and the rest. No, now the rest of the country was hell-bent on staying on pace with the big dogs for at least another furlong.

But even in the early days of this cycle, we speculated that firms trying to follow suit would see administrative changes in the aftermath of raises. We’ve already seen a few firms announce [changes to hourly minimums](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/firm-offers-raises-retroactive-to-july-1/) along with raises. But now comes a stealthy policy change, an increase in hours a full month and a half after handing out raises.

Crowell & Moring had a meeting on Friday laying out some changes for its promotion-track associates and counsel (at Crowell, associates are eligible to join the ranks of counsel after their fifth year).

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Increasing billable hour requirement to 2,000 per year, with 50 pro bono hours counting as billable until you hit 2,000, and above that, all pro bono counts. This is an increase from the old requirement of 1,900, same 50 hour pro bono rule.

A rough announcement to receive mid-year, but not a terribly surprising one. Many have speculated that an increase in base salary would trade off with bonuses. Frankly, the risk-averse lawyer population should be pleased to accept the guaranteed money over the possibility of going a year with a terrible bonus. That said, it’s never fun to find out that your “raise” may completely evaporate.

Capping the pro bono credit at 50 hours is a bit low, but this isn’t a change for Crowell, and at least pro bono hours count.

Those who hit the 2,000 hour requirement in Years 1-5 will receive “market” bonuses as long as they are in good standing and don’t have bad reviews. It’s not clear what this means or how many “bad” reviews would be sufficient to deny you a bonus. The market bonuses are the 2015 New York market scale (15k to 80k). Seems to be all-or-nothing bonus structure.

While this, understandably, scares associates, this “good standing” rhetoric is a mainstay of bonus structures. While it’s exactly the kind of vague condition that a lawyer would never accept imposed on their client by contract, it seems to work out at most firms. It’s basically [the “implication” discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yUafzOXHPE) from It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia — everything’s going to be fine, but associates work overtime to comply with partners because they’re afraid things won’t work out.

Here’s where it starts to get real weird. If you’re a 5th year and do not make counsel that year (few do, maybe 20% of the class each year?), your salary freezes at 260k (assuming you’re on the 2000 hour track) until you make counsel. No clear statement on what your bonuses would be at that point, but it is discretionary and less guaranteed that you would continue to receive the 5th year (and no word whether you could be eligible for 6th or 7th year level) market bonuses even if you continue to hit your 2,000 hours and remain in good standing.

Once one makes counsel, it appears that everything continues apace, but until that happens, senior associates are stuck. In fairness to the firm, this may just be a formalized version of the natural winnowing process of firm advancement. If so, taking a haircut on compensation may be better than an uptick in passive-aggressive hassles.

Another weird point — we were told that promotion-track associates/counsel had to decide by Sept 1 whether we wanted a reduced hours target for the coming year (Sept 1 to August 31). This seems to be effectively prohibiting you from going part-time mid-way through your working year.

Apparently compensation at Crowell is like playing Spades. But bidding on what’s going to happen over the next year is a stressful endeavor. Better not get pregnant in October! And what are the incentives here? If one bids for the increased schedule and misses, do they get no bonus at all? Should associates always bid on the reduced schedule to guarantee they get a reduced bonus rather than nothing? This seems confusing, and according to tipsters who weren’t in the central office, they couldn’t even see the slides, making this even more confusing.

But here’s the real concern when it comes to pushing up hourly requirements:

There’s not enough work for this move…. Now, associates will be scrounging for what little extra work there is, and it is very unlikely to me that more than a small minority of associates would be able to bill 2,000 even if they wanted to, especially in slower groups (of which there are many).

And this brings us back to how some firms probably [couldn’t afford](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/) the full Cravath raises they announced. If lawyers aren’t busy, throwing money at associates and asking them to “just do more” isn’t going to fix those utilization problems.

We’ll see how rampant hourly minimum changes and discount bonuses become in the coming months, but this is doubtless the final “adjustment” we see in the wake of raises.

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”).

# Faster Horses
## AI is so new and so foreign to most legal professionals that they may think of their current mode of working when expressing their needs.

“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” This is just one version of a popular quote often attributed to Henry Ford. Whether Ford actually said it or not, the point is that customers don’t always know what they want. Now bear with me for a moment: it’s not that customers can’t express their needs or that they can’t communicate solutions. The problem is that customers aren’t always aware of new technologies or solutions that can lead to new products and new markets.

In “The Innovator’s Dilemma” the late Harvard professor and author Clayton Christensen said it another way: you can’t do market research on a market that doesn’t exist yet. Asking people who have only ridden a horse what they think they want in an automobile, when they’ve never driven an automobile, would lead to some well-intentioned responses — but those responses would be lacking.

The problem is worse if the business analysts, product owners, and leadership responsible for developing that automobile have never driven one either. It’s human nature to gravitate toward what is familiar, but familiar concepts can only take us so far when we’re exploring the possibilities of a new technology.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Imagine someone conducting research on the automobile asking question like these:

- When you want your horse to go really fast, how would you want to do that? By swinging the reigns harder? Or do you think you’d use a bigger whip?
- Do you ever attach a carriage to your horse?
- With a faster horse, how often would you expect to replace the horseshoes?
These questions sound a bit absurd, but they highlight a very real problem for legal professionals looking to innovate in a world with new technologies like Generative AI. AI is so new and so foreign to most legal professionals that they may think of their current mode of working when expressing their needs. And many people who find themselves responsible for innovation in a law firm may have limited experience with AI. There may be a tendency to ask attorneys questions that are equivalent to those above about faster horses.

Ford was an interesting and complex person with great vision. He developed an assembly line for the Model T. Once the design for the Model T was good enough, he stopped making changes and focused on continuously driving cost out to make the car more affordable. He paid his employees enough and gave them time off so they could actually afford to purchase a Model T.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
What guided Henry Ford’s vision was a recognition that he was solving a transportation problem, not a horse problem.

For the legal innovator, it is important to step back or “helicopter up” to think about a higher level problem.

- Rather than improve the efficiency of document review, perhaps the problem to be solved is to eliminate the manual aspects of document review?
- Instead of improving legal research, perhaps it is more important to understand why the research is being conducted in the first place and solve that problem. Maybe the real problem is developing a legal argument or determining if a motion or pleading will be successful.
- Is there data available now that would make it possible to advise a client to settle a case rather than litigate?
- Can corporations automate compliance tasks that would give the general counsel and chief compliance officer confidence that they are complying with law?
- Are there ways to avoid litigation or mitigate risk in the first place?
Generative AI is likely going to change the way the law is practiced. Incremental change will occur, including productivity enhancements. But in the same way that automobiles changed transportation, AI, machine learning, and data analytics are likely going to change the practice of law. Before the automobile, traffic lights weren’t needed. And the infrastructure of service stations, oil companies, and car dealerships didn’t exist.

Just as Ford stepped back to understand he was solving for transportation, leadership in the legal profession will want to step back. What is the role of the law department in a corporation? To advise on individual matters that arise? Or support growth and shareholder value while ensuring compliance with the law?  For a firm, is it to manage client relationships and bill time? What if the billable hour goes away?

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I’m oversimplifying here, as many sophisticated law departments and firms have clear mission statements. But the point is, AI may cause the industry to step back and rethink.

The practice of law has historically been a labor-intensive field. Legal professionals use technology today for productivity, but the focus is primarily on human capital, including hiring, training, and retaining staff. If AI drives automation so that more of the work and value is done by machines and robots, it is likely to affect the capital structure of a firm. There may be a shift to provide more balance between human capital and capital invested on technology. The billable hour is great in a human intensive business model, but it falters when large investments pay out a return over a period of years. And across clients and matters.

Will firms be able to charge by the hour for AI computing time? Probably not. Embracing technology is only going to make firms better. Firms will be able to provide more value with AI-enabled services. The question is how to convey that value to clients and how to charge for it.

So regardless of role — innovators, legal ops, attorneys, paralegals, managing partners, and general counsel — all will eventually be confronted with areas of unfamiliarity.

When this happens, try to think like Henry Ford did when he was trying to build an automobile. What are the larger problems that Generative AI can solve for? If you can focus on what those problems are, you’re more likely to understand the potential impacts that this technology can have on the legal industry — and from there determine how to harness its power to your advantage.

Patrick Mahomes

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I would say something like a top-tier lawyer. That would be the first thing I think of. Someone who has to think on his feet, execute at the right time, and deal with high-pressure situations.

— Kansas City Chiefs Quarterback [Patrick Mahomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes), in response to being asked to compare his “innovative and unpredictable” playing approach on the field to a non-football activity. Mahomes is the first quarterback in Super Bowl history with three 10+ point comeback wins. Check out the full clip, below.

Patrick is singing my song. [#ThereWillBe](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThereWillBe?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

# Cravath Really Screwed Everyone In Biglaw Out Of Fall Bonuses, Didn't They?
## Thanks, Cravath.

To say the Biglaw fall bonus train has slowed down is an understatement.

It all [started so promisingly](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/?rf=1). Cooley made the first move in the [COVID appreciation bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) game, offering associates between $2,500 and $7,500 as a special thank you from the firm for their hard work during the pandemic. But then [Davis Polk ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/)got involved with a new standard, and it just blew away the Cooley scale. Their bonuses started at $7,500 and went all the way up to $40,000. And firms [quickly](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/milbank-bonuses/) started [piling](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/irell-bonuses/) on this [new bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/sullivan-cromwell-makes-a-move-in-covid-19-bonus-war/) [scale.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/debevoise-bonuses/) Weil offered a seemingly unpopular [hours-based bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/weil-offers-a-new-take-on-fall-bonuses-theyre-hours-based-and-theyre-huge/), but, thus far, no one has jumped on board with that.

But then there was the notable outlier: Kirkland — the [world’s richest law firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/the-global-100-the-richest-law-firms-in-the-world-2020/) — [begged off](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/) fall special bonuses, and seemed to be asking the market not to follow the trend. And then Cravath followed with their [own no-bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cravath-is-not-offering-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-pissed/) announcement. Since that fateful announcement by the traditional compensation leader, no other firms have taken the plunge and handed out special fall bonuses. But plenty [have declined](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/omelveny-says-no-to-fall-bonuses-are-covid-appreciation-bonuses-over/) to give out [appreciation bonuses.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/paul-weiss-wont-be-offering-fall-bonuses-and-associates-are-angry/)

So color me not-at-all shocked that Fried Frank has made a statement that there will be no fall bonuses for associates [(available in full on the next page)](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/fried-frank-no-bonuses/2/). As one tipster said:

I’ll say that this isn’t surprising at all. The firm has made clear that they were only going to move ahead with special bonuses if the market leaders did so. When a few of the big firms decided they wouldn’t, it was clear FF would not.

Thanks for nothing, Cravath. At least Fried Frank notes they will be taking the fall bonuses into account when it’s time for year-end bonuses.

So, what do you think? Is this yet another sign to other firms not to match? We think it could be. Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=FriedFrank), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

# Supreme Court Term Limits Bill Should Have Broad Bipartisan Support So It Probably Won't

Once more with feeling.

Congress has [a new bill proposing staggered term limits](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3575349-democrats-introduce-bill-to-enact-term-limits-for-supreme-court-justices/) for the active panel of the Supreme Court, which is logical and popular because the Supreme Court has wildly succeeded in bringing Americans together around the fact that the Supreme Court is a trash institution at this point. And yet this bill is probably doomed because the other branches are only slightly less garbage.

Imposing term limits for active duty Supreme Court justices isn’t new — the first effort dates back to 1807. Nor is it radical given that the Constitution — the document with the text we’re supposed to follow to the letter! — defers all these questions to the political branches, only stating that federal judges generally can’t be kicked off the payroll absent impeachment. How the Supreme Court is structured and which justices comprise the Supreme Court at any given time is purely statutory.

[This bill](https://hankjohnson.house.gov/sites/hankjohnson.house.gov/files/documents/SCOTUS_TERMS_xml.pdf) proposes that each presidential term make a nomination in the first and third year after an election. So one-term presidents would get two nominations and two-term presidents would get four. Thus eliminating the insanity of a popular two-term president putting two justices on the Court while an unpopular one-term president who lost both elections by millions of votes placing three justices in lifetime positions. The justices would then serve for 18 years before moving to senior status where they could serve to resolve recusals, fill unanticipated vacancies, and ride circuit.

It not only cools the stakes for each nomination by giving every chief executive equal access, it opens up the job to arguably more capable jurists that get overlooked now by presidents using actuarial tables to make increase the odds that their pick can hang around for three decades.

[Fix the Court](https://fixthecourt.com/) explains how this is different from the last term limits bill:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In terms of the text, the Johnson bill, called the Supreme Court TERM Act (H.R. 8500), differs from the Khanna bill in that the former does not exempt the current nine from being moved to senior status. In other words, were the TERM Act to go into effect, President Biden would make a SCOTUS pick next year, who, once confirmed, would push Justice Thomas to senior status, at which point Thomas would no longer hear cases or vote on petitions. The 2025 nominee would push Chief Justice Roberts to senior status, and so on. Under both proposals, senior status justices could return to SCOTUS should the number of active justices fall below nine.

While it would be such a rotten shame to see Thomas leave before he could further erase the Fourteenth Amendment, it [could reduce the risk of further Court leaks](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/taking-bets-on-who-leaked-the-supreme-court-opinion/).

This idea is wildly popular too! Over two-thirds of the public agree that [the Supreme Court needs term limits](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2022/07/25/more-than-two-thirds-of-americans-want-term-limits-for-supreme-court-justices-poll-finds/?sh=323dc98e6d66). And while that makes this a bipartisan opinion, the idea is obviously more popular among Democrats who’ve watched a Court majority made up of nominees rammed into their jobs by presidents who came to office after losing the popular vote take an axe to abortion rights while creating an individual gun right that [even conservative justices knew was constitutional gibberish](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/supreme-court-is-about-to-erase-more-gun-laws-now-would-be-a-good-time-to-leak-that-draft-opinion/) as recently as the early 90s.

Which is why, despite its popularity and straightforward reasonability will probably doom this legislation. Back when Ruth Bader Ginsburg seemed like she could live forever, [conservatives](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/conservatives-arguing-for-supreme-court-term-limits-watch-democrats-somehow-screw-this-up/) like [Ted Cruz](https://newrepublic.com/article/122225/ted-cruz-right-supreme-court-needs-term-limits) openly called for Supreme Court term limits and [that was the moment](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/the-missed-opportunities-haunting-the-supreme-courts-abortion-move/) when everyone should’ve come together over the idea.

But now it’s going to be seen as too partisan and die in the Senate.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Hopefully I’m wrong about that. Because this is a reform that the judicial system desperately needs as it suffers a legitimacy crisis far deeper [than ASSLaw clerks](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/supreme-court-clerks-showcase-the-only-diversity-that-doesnt-matter/).

It just seems like this proposal is coming several days late and millions of dollars short. Staring into a bleak midterm election with this proposal doesn’t look like a winning strategy. This is why Democrats needed to embrace the objectively bad idea of expanding the Supreme Court [as a negotiating strategy](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/democrats-pitch-supreme-court-expansion-a-bad-idea-but-maybe-a-good-strategy/) from day 1. Lean into the far more aggressive option of adding 10 more seats to the Court in January 2021 and then you could make term limits a compromise position in 2022.

Indeed, there’s a sound argument that the broad popularity of term limits stems in part from polls that contrast it with the more extreme court expansion proposal (which [polls in the high 40s](http://demandjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dfp-demand-justice-increasing-scotus-size-toplines.pdf?link_id=1&can_id=c5ecf99bd92e40e9132812e37bfe8d6c&source=email-new-poll-shows-plurality-support-for-expanding-the-supreme-court-to-13-justices&email_referrer=email_1149629&email_subject=new-poll-shows-plurality-support-for-expanding-the-supreme-court-to-13-justices)) that is usually asked as part of the same polling. It’s, like, actual empirical data that supports opening negotiations with a more aggressive option!

But the [Democrats didn’t do that](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/joe-biden-announces-supreme-court-reform-commission/). Maybe taking the maximalist position off the table from jump won’t doom the right solution proposed by this bill.

But it certainly didn’t help.

# Strip Club Summer Associate Outing?
## Don't take summer associates to strip clubs... or any place even vaguely approaching the category of strip club.

Firms expend a lot of time and energy planning an enticing social calendar for summer associates. Summer programs amount to the front lines in the legal talent war and while law students covet a rewarding professional experience, earning a reputation for giving law students an after-hours experience to remember pays dividends down the road.

And while “going to a strip club” certainly amounts to an experience to remember, it’s absolutely, positively not one the firm should offer.

A [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/biglaw/comments/16a8swc/gunderson_dettmer_sf_took_their_summers_to_a/) claims that Gunderson Dettmer DID take summers to a strip club this year. And there’s some safe but maybe not advisable for work video. Though if you’re working from home these days, you’re all good.

The discussion on Reddit questioned if this video really shows a strip club. It does seem like a strip club with a notable dearth of strippers. This appears to be some kind of straightforward nightclub that happens to have a couple of scantily clad go-go dancers.

But quibbling over how asymptotically close a venue comes to a strip club is like debating how many angels can pole dance below the head of a pin. Lap dances and champagne rooms aren’t what makes a strip club an inappropriate work event. Hooters isn’t a strip club but wouldn’t make for an acceptable work event either. The problem is any establishment wrapped in more misogyny than clothes.

Gunderson has already [deferred start dates](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/gunderson-deferred-associates-start-work/) and [laid off associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-firm-lays-off-10-of-its-workforce-may-defer-incoming-associates/), but the same Reddit thread suggests the firm no-offered about half its summers this year.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Including, the thread suggests, the summer who complained to HR about the club trip! Not a great look.

We reached out to Gunderson for comment yesterday morning but heard nothing back. Presumably this wasn’t an officially sanctioned event, but rather some sort of afterparty where someone with a corporate card decided to take a few summers after the ball game or something. Not that it makes it any better: law firms need to educate their people that even these quasi-sanctioned events reflect upon the firm.

Next time, consider a trip to the art museum. There’s might still be barely dressed women, but it’s not a problem when they’re made out of marble.

Don’t you think we’re repeating ourselves?

Every morning, it seems, I receive an email with hot tips for business development featuring an interview with some anonymous partner at some equally anonymous firm.

I don’t click through, but what the heck could these guys be saying?

It’s all been said before. But I’ll say it again, and maybe we can stop sending the emails.

I’ll start with the implicit assumptions: Be a good lawyer. Do great work for your existing clients. And all that stuff. But you wanted ideas for business development, not for practicing law. So here goes.

You develop business by doing three things.

You develop business wholesale. Get famous:

Write articles. Give talks. Join bar associations or charitable boards. Get interviewed and quoted in the press.

Or, in today’s world:

Blog. Tweet. (Frankly, I think blogging is likely to do more good than tweeting. With a blog, you can demonstrate knowledge of a subject. With a tweet — 140 characters — you can do no more than draw attention to other people’s ideas. I’d rather hire lawyers with thoughts of their own than lawyers who simply alert me that other people are smart. But what do I know?) Do podcasts. (I think these are the wave of the future. Writing is hard; talking is easy; interviewing other people badly is easier still. Look for podcasts to flourish.) Join Facebook. Use LinkedIn to connect with people. Publish articles on LinkedIn.

But, like I said, that’s the wholesale side of developing business. In a word (actually, two words): Get famous.

That’s the first step in developing business.

You also must work on the retail level to develop business.

So work the retail level. Make contact:

Never dine alone. Find an [authentic reason for staying in touch.](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/an-authentic-reason-for-staying-in-touch/) Send emails to people about topics of mutual interest. (Monitoring the case law in a field and letting folks know about new cases that might interest them is a good idea. But there are lots of other reasons to stay in touch.) Attend receptions and cocktail parties. Make introductions: Introduce potential clients to acquaintances of yours who might do the client some good.

Be nice. People skills matter.

Cross-sell. Maybe if you cross-sell one of your partners, she’ll cross-sell you. (Or maybe not. It depends on the partner. And the firm. And whether or not you’re any good.)

Know something while you’re doing all that stuff: Say intelligent things. Understand the client’s business. And so on.

But the basic idea is always the same. At the retail level: Make contact. That’s the only way to be top-of-mind when the decision to retain counsel is being made.

Okay: Get famous. Make contact.

Third: Repeat.

Do the first two things over and over, until they pay off (or you die, whichever comes first).

That’s it. [“That is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.”](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/44477)

I guess there’s one other thing to add: Get lucky.

Be handed a client by an old-timer who’s retiring.

Have your article on a subject cross the general counsel’s desk just as the general counsel is confronting that issue.

Have a client’s usual firm get conflicted out the day after you had lunch with an important client contact.

Have some guy search the web and conclude that he needs a lawyer with precisely the type of thing you did last year.

Like I said: Get lucky.

But here’s my question: This is all really obvious.

And many, many people have said it all before. ([Even I did](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/12/inside-straight-building-a-practice-a-case-study/). In this column. Five years ago. But maybe you weren’t reading my columns back then. Or maybe you’ve just forgotten.)

So what the heck do those emails that cross my desk every morning add to the conversation?

And what are those seminars about developing business teaching you?

Wouldn’t you think that one, say, 150-page book could tell you everything that anyone could conceivably want to know about business development?

Have we gotten to the point that people are talking for the sake of talking, because there’s no longer anything worthwhile left to say?

I fear that, on many subjects, the answer is “yes.”

# Litigation Finance: The In-House Perspective
## Litigation funding has gained significant traction in the legal departments of the most coveted Biglaw clients.

In recent years, we have seen litigation finance transform from a nascent financial product into an important and thriving fixture of the legal industry. Building on [previous research](http://lakewhillans.com/research/litigation-finance-the-litigators-perspective/), Lake Whillans recently surveyed in-house attorneys at a wide range of companies, including those at more than 140 Fortune 1000 (or larger) corporations. They found that over a quarter of respondents from corporate legal departments have firsthand experience with litigation finance, and approximately 70% declared that they would consider using litigation for future matters.

The results of the survey are a clear indicator that litigation funding has gained significant traction in the legal departments of the most coveted Biglaw clients.

Among the questions the Lake Whillans survey explored:

- Why types of companies are using litigation finance?
- How does adoption vary among industries?
- How prevalent is firsthand experience with litigation finance among in-house attorneys?
- What concerns exist about working with a funder?
The findings are an interesting snapshot of where litigation finance sits within the broader legal industry. [Check out the full report here](http://lakewhillans.com/research/litigation-finance-in-house-perspective/).

# Biglaw Offering 'Hot Fudge Sundae Bars' And 'Gift Cards' To Laterals
## Warm and fuzzy recruiting...

“Ice cream socials. Gift cards. Plenty of thank-you’s. BigLaw may not be known for being sweet and cuddly, but more firms are warming up to make new associate hires feel the love and hopefully stick around awhile before looking for a new home….”

Oh stop it. This level of saccharine hasn’t made you wretch yet?

That’s from [a recent Law360 piece](http://www.law360.com/articles/854342/biglaw-frees-its-inner-oprah-for-warm-embrace-of-laterals) on covering the National Association of Legal Search Consultants symposium on Friday. Apparently the hot new trend in lateral recruiting is to pull out all the fuzzies and offer perks like “a work-hours ‘hot fudge sundae bar'” to make laterals feel at home.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It’s not that Biglaw couldn’t stand to be more welcoming. Embracing a cold, isolating existence of 18-hour days punctuated only by getting screamed at by fragile egos isn’t a matter of “toughness,” it’s just stupid. But the problem with blowing pixie dust at recruits is that all the forced happiness actually makes it harder to find a place where anyone would want to work. Why can’t Biglaw find the happy medium? As the old joke goes:

Upon arriving at the Pearly Gates, St. Peter told a recently deceased young man that he had a choice in his eternal resting place. After walking around heaven for a few hours to see a bunch of old people play Scrabble on clouds, he went to hell. Hell was bright and sunny, complete with parties, swimming, non-stop refreshments.

“Have you made your choice?” asked St. Peter.

“Yes, I’m going to go with hell,” the man replied.

With a puff of smoke, the man plopped into a horrific pit of lava, surrounded by grotesque demons poking him constantly with pitchforks. He finally managed to catch the attention of Satan himself.

“What happened? I toured this place and it was amazing.”

“Oh,” replied Satan, “you must have seen our summer associate program.”

Unlike the dolt in the joke, most everyone is clued in enough to know the summer program isn’t representative of Biglaw life. But why do so many firms embrace the artificial binary between the effusive summer associate love-in and the harsh reality of Biglaw? Paradise or hell. There’s a way to just be generally decent all the time, and some Biglaw firms — or at least some practice areas with them — have worked this out. The problem with the wild mood swings in Biglaw is it makes finding that solid, long-term niche all the harder.

And now it looks like firms are bringing the summer associate model of half-assed over-enthusiasm to the lateral field. Look, if firms are going to keep it up and really maintain enhanced levels of attorney contact and work-sponsored social opportunities — complete with hot fudge or otherwise — then that’s a positive step in terms of integrating new hires and building a welcoming culture for the long term. It’s more hokey than I’d like, but any sustained effort would be appreciated. Even hokey ploys can get some people to come out of their shells and improve the overall work culture.

But if this is just “Summer Program: Extreme Lateral Edition,” a barrage of good will to be abruptly ditched after six months or so, then it’s just another manic mood swing for Biglaw and ultimately makes laterals feel even more out-of-place and confused when they have to wait a year to really understand what the work culture is really like.

# The Pandemic Is The Time For Biglaw To 'Double-Down' On Diversity
## Diversity is important, now more than ever.

In this week’s edition of The Jabot podcast, I talk with Kori S. Carew, Esq., Seyfarth Shaw’s chief inclusion and diversity officer and leader of [The Belonging Project](https://www.seyfarth.com/the-belonging-project.html). The initiative is a nationwide collaborative effort to proactively combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on diversity in the legal profession.

Kori and I chat about why the initiative is necessary during COVID-19, how the global pandemic overlaps with diversity issues, the goals of the initiative, why diversity in Biglaw is so important, and why “we must double-down on our efforts during this challenging time.”

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

# Does This Memo (A) Burn Every Bridge Or (B) Burn Most Of The Bridges?

Tom: This is hilarious!
Sue: Let’s totally swirlie him later!

The funny departure memo. Everyone aspires to it, almost no one does it, fewer still do it well, and absolutely none of its intended audience appreciates it. What is this polished work supposed to convey to the rest of the firm? Partners think you’re mocking their generosity in employing you, and associates think you’re having a laugh as you leave them to their wretched fate. What was Bane’s line from The Dark Knight Rises?

There’s a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth… Hope. Every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy… So simple… And like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned here that there can be no true despair without hope.

You read that in the Bane voice, didn’t you? Go ahead and admit it.

Anyway, that’s why the funny departure memo is meant as the extra salt in the sucking chest wound of Biglaw practice. What else is a lawyer to think when they read a departure memo in the form of a multiple choice test?

Here’s what they think: Oh, look! You took the time to write something cute. Does that mean you’re:

(a) an insufferable creative type living on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams we call Biglaw;
(b) someone who really, really thought the LSAT was an accurate depiction of being a lawyer;
(c) obviously the luckiest f**ker on the planet to treat going to law school as a lark instead of a blood-signed contract of involuntary servitude; or,
(d) desperately hoping Above the Law will put that final cap on your flameout of a stint.

Barring an “all of the above,” we’ll just have to settle on (d), because Above the Law feeds on the salt ground into those wounds, and gleefully applauds the author for doing it.

The author, by the way, is an associate now formerly of Kirkland & Ellis in San Francisco. His departure memo, sent out last night, is a tour de force of a departure. So let’s get to it! Cue Alicia Keys, because THIS… BRIDGE… IS… ON… FIIIIIRRRRRREEEE…

After _____[1]_____, it is time to say goodbye to K&E….

a. recovering from amnesia and realizing that I never went to law school
b. a wonderful two months
c. thoughtful consideration over eight glasses of wine at lunch
d. laundering millions of dollars via your servers

This may be the best choice presented in the entire departure memo, because, according to LinkedIn, he’s worked at Kirkland for almost one year. Once you eliminate (b) as an option…

I am leaving to _____[2]_____.

a. pursue my dream of being crowned champion of the nineteenth season of RuPaul’s Drag Race
b. join the Trump/Pence 2016 campaign
c. [intentionally omitted]
d. judge the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Hey, if someone from (b) was able to (c) Melania’s paragraph about values, they’d be in a much better place.

I have _____[3]_____my time here

a. from start-to-finish thoroughly enjoyed
b. delivery delayed literally thousands of emails during
c. somehow survived
d. developed a drinking problem as a result of

Remember those MBE questions where it seemed like multiple answers were correct but there just wasn’t that option?

and I will _____[4]_____.

a. make sure to avoid 555 California Street for the rest of my life
b. remember my time here fondly
c. steal as many office supplies as I can fit in my man purse
d. miss all of you I’ve come to know

Speaking of… is he going to remember his time fondly or miss everyone? That’s the trick! This is how you know it’s (c).

I look forward to _____[5]_____

a. (re-) starting my new (old) job
b. leaving the office today
c. never using Carpe Diem again
d. moving to New York City for its relatively more affordable housing

Looks like someone’s been reading the [ATL real estate comparison guide](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/)! His old job was with Clifford Chance in New York, so if he’s heading back there he’s not escaping Carpe Diem — or some reasonable facsimile of it — anytime soon.

But it sure sounds like he’s bouncing on the whole idea of lawyerin’…

and will _____[6]_____

a. definitely call you if I screw up and require legal representation
b. crash the next open bar event
c. be leaving behind a pile of glitter in my office
d. keep in touch

We all, at least those of us he’s not abandoning at Kirkland, wish him well. It’s a fun letter, and he’ll be a wise and capable Eurovision adjudicator.

# An Associate With Little Work Is A Sad Sight
## Associates who do not have much work to do might rightly feel paranoid about their situation.

As mentioned in a previous column, law firms are not always efficient when it comes to dolling out work. Instead of having a centralized system through which partners give work to associates, most law firms simply encourage partners to give work to associates they like the most or associates that have a workplace near them in an office. As a result, some attorneys in an office might have too much work while others do not have enough to keep them busy. Of course, some people might argue that this means good attorneys will excel while bad lawyers will fall to the wayside, but this can lead to inefficiencies in how people bill hours. In any event, an associate attorney with little work is a sad sight, and partners should make sure everyone is sufficiently occupied whenever they can.

Being slow is absolutely miserable as an associate. Whenever I was slow at a law firm, my days would drag on since time moves much slower when you have little to do. Law firm life is already tedious as it is, and trying to fill time around an office without completing assignments for clients can be grueling. There is also a sense of shame associated with being slow at an office. People pull a salary regardless of how much work they are completing day to day, and it does not feel good not to be contributing to a firm by completing assignments.

Furthermore, associates who do not have much work to do might rightly feel paranoid about their situation. Associates are evaluated on the amount of billable hours they record more than any other metric. This makes a lot of sense, since associates are only valuable to law firms if they can generate revenue, and billable hours are directly connected to the amount of hours that an associate bills. If an associate does not have enough work, they might be scared that they will not meet billable hour expectations, which might mean that they are on the chopping block at a shop. In addition, attorneys might be fearful that they are slow because partners do not like their work rather than benign reasons like just being generally slow with certain types of cases.

Slow associates at law firms exhibit a variety of really sad behaviors. One of which is that slow associates need to go around an office looking for work. This is not a pleasant sight. An associate looking for more work is kind of reminiscent of Oliver Twist asking for more food, and it definitely feels like the associate is begging for something from superiors. Many times associates asked for more work in my experience, you could almost hear the desperation in their voices or a look in their eyes that they were hopeful that they could finally get some work so that they no longer needed to go around and ask for more assignments.

There are some things that associates with little work can do in order to improve their situation. Perhaps most importantly, slow associates can pitch their own assignments to partners. This not only shows initiative, which can improve the associate’s image around an office, but this can help keep the associate busy. At the beginning of my career, I worked at a law firm that was going through some tough times financially. I would regularly review the dockets of cases we were involved in so that I could be the first person to know of case developments.

If I saw a filing that could lead to a potential research project or for which a response was required, I would immediately reach out to partners in order to see if I could work on such tasks. By doing this, I was able to fill some of the time I might have otherwise spent without work. However, this can only get you so far and in many instances, budgets and other constraints limit partners from greenlighting all assignments proposed by associates.

In any case, having slow associates can be horrendous to the morale of a firm. Not only can it make people feel bad, it can also make associates mad if they have too much work to do and are not meeting expectations of partners. Accordingly, law firms should be more cognizant of how much work everyone has to do around an office and ensure that it is less likely that an associate will have too little work to complete.

# David Boies Scores Coup With HUGE Lateral Pickup
## Susan Estrich reunites with David Boies, years after they first worked together.

David Boies

“I’ve been trying to recruit her for over 30 years,” David Boies told me. How did he manage to finally succeed? “I don’t know. Is it possible to just wear somebody down?” he said with a laugh.

However it happened, his decades of labor have finally paid off. Today, Boies Schiller announced that they have coaxed Susan Estrich to join the firm’s appellate practice in the Los Angeles office, completing Boies’s mission to work with Susan again after first working with her on the Senate Judiciary Committee in the late 70s.

Estrich doesn’t credit this move to being worn down. In fact, she may just be following the advice of her old boss. While she clerked for Justice Stevens, a pair of young lawyers working at the Judiciary Committee asked to interview her over lunch with the caveat that they wanted to meet her in the Supreme Court cafeteria. Estrich was pretty confident these two, a couple of fellows named David Boies and Stephen Breyer, were covertly angling to have lunch with Justice Stevens. After a delightful lunch, Justice Stevens told Estrich to accept the job offer the two had brought. “You should take it,” he said. “I think those guys have great futures.”

Supreme advice aside, Estrich sees the fit with Boies Schiller as a perfect match with her life philosophy: “so much of life is taking advantage of opportunities when you see them.” She described meeting up with Boies recently, “and it felt like coming home. He offered a chance for a new chapter for me, and I’m excited about a new chapter.”

And it’s a new chapter for Boies Schiller too. As Jonathan Schiller said, “I look forward to trying cases and arbitral hearings with Susan all over the world. Susan will also strengthen our growing California practice.” That California practice is a key part of this move. We’ve been watching the firm [bolster its California presence](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/boies-schiller-picks-up-a-top-boutique/) over the last several months, and now they can add Susan Estrich to the office to help it grow.

Estrich may famously believe that people [shouldn’t go to law school](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/quinn-emanuel-partner-warns-dont-go-to-law-school/), but she seems to be making a pretty good career out of it herself. And she’s a little surprised at that fact, describing the bulk of her career as trying to do anything with her law degree except practice — jumping from her Supreme Court clerkship with Justice Stevens to the Senate to working on Ted Kennedy’s presidential campaign, managing the Dukakis campaign, and serving as a law professor.

But despite trying to stay away from it, when she found herself joining private practice with Quinn Emanuel 10 years ago, she discovered to her surprise that “I actually like it.”


Susan Estrich

As Estrich departs Quinn Emanuel, she leaves a legacy of high-profile representations, including everyone from Home Depot to Mattel in its epic tussles over Bratz to Roger Ailes in his sexual harassment fight. At the time she took on Ailes, I quipped that, in that specific job, I wasn’t wishing her much success. But that’s a wholly different matter than blaming a lawyer for taking on a controversial client.

When it comes to criticism over controversial clients, Estrich has something else in common with Boies, who’s taken recent knocks in the mainstream press and, frankly, I don’t get it. Boies weathered a torrent of criticism over his representation of Harvey Weinstein and his work for Theranos. Sure, signing off on a security firm of former spies that, among other things, apparently interfered with the work of another Boies client was a mistake — one that Boies admits — but the bulk of the commentary around Boies these days seems more incensed that Boies would take on these hard cases at all. As a recent [New York Times article explored](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/business/david-boies-pleads-not-guilty.html), that reasoning never really resonated with most of us in the legal community, who take it as a given that lawyers have to zealously represent clients — often troubling ones. Lawyers may want to steer clear of representations that [undermine their specific brand](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/mother-knows-best-gloria-allred-disses-daughters-decision-to-rep-harvey-weinstein/), but lawyers like Boies and Estrich are high-end, Biglaw advocates whose careers are built on representing to the hilt people and institutions that need legal help and are willing to pay for the best.

And with Susan joining the team, Boies Schiller further solidifies itself as one of the best from coast to coast.

# Stroock Reportedly Cut Pay, Hours As It Struggled To Find Merger Partner

Stroock & Stroock & Lavan may have found its (latest) [“non-exclusive” match in Pillsbury Winthrop](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/stroock-is-talking-to-another-am-law-100-firm-about-merging-but-its-not-exclusive/), but the firm had been leaking lawyers like a sieve ever since it broke up with Nixon Peabody, and news now comes that the firm had reportedly cut pay and hours for its most senior staff members while in search for another business suitor.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/13/stroock-cut-pay-and-hours-of-senior-staff-as-merger-talks-drag-on/) provides additional details on these rumors of the firm’s fraught finances:

Some staff have seen their pay cut by as much at 60%, sources said, and certain teams are working on a near skeleton staff. It’s unclear whether the firm has reinstated any hours and pay to those affected since July.

Law.com previously reported that two senior staffers and one junior staffer departed the firm in August. It’s not clear whether those departures are related to the whittling of pay and hours for senior staff.

Recall that [Stroock conducted layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/stroock-layoffs/) among both staff and attorneys to kick off 2023, and that was just the start of the firm’s personnel losses. Considering all of attorneys and staff who have left since then, and with pay cuts now on the table, it’s no wonder that former employees saw the firm [headed for certain disaster](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/stroocks-new-merger-partner-means-the-firm-may-not-face-bankruptcy-dissolution/) without a viable merger partner.

Once again, best of luck to Stroock as it embarks on yet another merger journey — it sounds like the firm could use all the luck it can get.

# Here Are The Law Firms Donald Trump Is Paying With His Campaign Donations
## Jones Day has debased itself. Will McDermott Will & Emery be next?

[BuzzFeed reports](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tariniparti/trump-campaign-spending?utm_term=.tr8KOXPvBr#.shV2Mn0Lyl) that around 20 percent of Trump’s campaign spending this year has gone to his legal fees. A big difference between Trump-the-Businessman versus Trump-the-President seems to be that President Trump actually pays his legal bills. So… people change, I guess.

Trump’s 2020 campaign to re-elect has already spent $835,000 on legal fees in 2018, though some of it was almost certainly for services rendered in 2017. Here are the firms that have profited the most from Trump’s troubles:

Trump campaign legal expenses, first quarter, 2018:

JONES DAY: $345,000+
LAROCCA HORNIK: $185,000+
HARDER LLP: $93,000+
SCHERTLER & ONORATO: $65,000+
VAN HOY: $58,000+
BELKIN BURDEN: $40,000+
THE TRUMP CORPORATION: $24,000+
MCDERMOTT WILL & EMERY: $13,000+
SEYFARTH: $1,300+

Last week, we reported that Jones Day was [absolutely hammered in our ATL Power 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/above-the-law-power-100-law-firm-rankings-are-out/), largely because their “reputation” scores suffered. Taking $345,000 of Trump’s white grievance money isn’t going to help matters.

I wonder if Jones Day will be a cautionary tale for McDermott Will & Emery. You can see that MWE hasn’t done a lot of work for Trump so far. But MWE partner [Todd Harrison](https://www.mwe.com/en/team/h/harrison-todd-r) has been all over the Trump attempt to assert privilege over the documents seized from Michael Cohen’s offices. Harrison has been out front, carrying Trump’s water that somebody other than the Department of Justice’s taint team has to determine which documents are privileged.

McDermott hasn’t promoted its association with Trump the way Jones Day did. That might make a big difference in the recruiting and lateral market. But every time some Trump argument shows up on MWE letterhead, more people will be turned off from the firm.

Trump isn’t a regular client. He’s a deeply divisive figure who represents white supremacy, sexual predation, and the attack on the rule of law (to some). Representing him carries unique reputational risks.

# Appreciate Lawyers Who Have Swagger
## Lawyers should not be afraid to let their swagger show while practicing law.

As many attorneys and staff know from firsthand experience, the legal profession can be extremely boring at times. Even though movies and television shows sometimes glorify the work of lawyers, and focus on the parts of the profession that have tons of drama, the reality is that many attorneys conduct mundane tasks on a day-to-day basis. As a result, it is always refreshing to see a lawyer who has swagger and acts in an entertaining and flamboyant fashion since this breaks the monotony of legal practice and might lead the lawyer to achieve more for his or her clients.

The first time I encountered a lawyer who had swagger was while watching “Breaking Bad” in law school. Most people know the Saul Goodman character of the show, the somewhat shady criminal lawyer who helps many of the main characters accomplish their illicit deeds. Of course, it is not a good idea to glorify criminality, and we should all remember that Saul Goodman does not represent the legal profession well in how he violated professional ethics and broke the law.

However, Saul Goodman (and Jimmy McGill as explored in the prequel series “Better Call Saul) had swagger and an entertaining style in how he practiced law. He wore flashy suits which ensured that he was the center of attention when he traveled to court. In addition, he constantly made jokes with everyone he talked to, which added a level of levity that made accomplishing difficult tasks a little easier. People might be more willing to deal with an entertaining lawyer like him than any of the drab pencil-pushers attorneys encounter every day.

Of course, Saul Goodman is a fictional character, but some lawyers I have encountered in my career also have swagger, and this makes it a treat to encounter these attorneys in the legal profession. One time, I was walking to court, and I noticed an attorney drive by in an absolutely amazing car. The vehicle was a super-expensive sports car, and in the words of Silicon Valley, [it had doors that open like this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oV4IVy8tvE) The paint job on the car was sure to catch anyone’s attention. When the lawyer stepped out of the car, he was wearing a flamboyant suit that would definitely attract attention.

Sure, some people would call this lawyer a show off for driving to court in a car that probably cost more than the amount of money I needed to borrow to attend law school. However, this lawyer had style, and it was a lot of fun to talk to him and see his swagger. This definitely broke up the monotony of heading to court to go through the motions of yet another discovery conference.

Earlier in my career, I had an adversary who was less showy but he still had a fair amount of swagger. Pretty much every email my adversary wrote had a joke in it, and sometimes they would be laugh-out-loud funny. Not everyone appreciated this lawyer’s humor, and in conversations with all of the attorneys involved in the case, some of the other lawyers were not fans of the antics of our adversary.

However, it was a real treat for me to work with this lawyer. Sometimes, I do not like hopping on a call with adversaries, since they will invariably include the same old pleasantries and then hashing out boring details about a case with which I am involved. Nevertheless, whenever I spoke to this adversary, I looked forward to it, since I knew I would probably be laughing during our call and come away from it with a positive experience.

Such swagger probably helped this adversary’s client too. It is best if lawyers involved in a case have a solid connection and feel comfortable speaking to one another to hash things out. Taking a lighthearted and entertaining approach to conducting business can help ensure that lawyers feel comfortable reaching out to one another on a case.

Of course, swagger is hard to teach, and it is not a skill that is easily acquired. I remember one time, a boss I had earlier in my career talked about a new initiative he was advancing. To make a joke or keep things light, at the end of a mission statement, he said something along the lines of “and we are going to have fun doing this” to which no one in the audience reacted positively. And in some instances, it is more appropriate to be serious and not display swagger in the practice of law.

However, lawyers should not be afraid to let their swagger show while practicing law. Not only will such efforts eliminate some of the boring aspects of practicing law, but keeping things light and entertaining can have a positive impact on a representation.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Bankruptcy is what you want to avoid at all costs. The trustee in law firm bankruptcies claws back compensation against individual partners. So that is why, if you’re a law firm or an accounting firm, bankruptcy cases are not pretty.

— [Leslie Corwin](https://www.duanemorris.com/attorneys/lesliecorwin.html), a lawyer at Duane Morris who’s overseen numerous law firm wind-downs, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/death-of-a-law-firm-how-stroock-collapsed-after-150-years) on why Stroock & Stroock & Lavan will be trying its hardest to [stay out of bankruptcy](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/stroock-working-on-wind-down-trying-to-keep-firm-out-of-bankruptcy/) during its [dissolution and wind down](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/stroock-to-dissolve-close-its-doors-after-nearly-150-years-in-business/).

# Not All Biglaw Firms Are Pushing Their First-Year Start Dates Into 2021
## A handful that we know of are starting remotely this fall -- and one firm is even onboarding associates in person.

Biglaw firms across the country have delayed the start dates of their incoming associates to January 2021 (or later) out of an abundance of caution thanks to the coronavirus. At the time these announcements were made, remote work was still new and we were in a state of economic upheaval. Now that almost a year has passed, these COVID accommodations are no longer so novel and there’s plenty of of work to be had. That said, several firms have decided to start their first-years remotely in 2020 — and one is even bringing its freshmen attorneys into the office.

Biglaw firms that are onboarding their incoming associates in 2020 include:

- Fenwick & West
- Start date of October 19
- Goodwin Procter
- Start date of October 19
- Latham & Watkins
- Start date in late October/early November
- McDermott Will & Emery
- Start date of October 14 or January 2021 (up to associates)
- McGuireWoods
- Start date in November — in person, if possible
- Morgan, Lewis & Bockius
- Start date sometime in November

UPDATE (1:00 p.m.): Sources tell us Kirkland & Ellis is doing remote onboarding for first-years in New York today. Locke Lord also started first years today as well. Jones Day will start its first-years nationwide on November 9 (whether they’ll be remote or not is a different story).

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/10/16/as-others-delay-these-firms-proceed-with-first-year-onboarding-at-a-distance/) has more information on what’s going on at McGuireWoods:

The firm has been working at a roughly 30% occupancy rate as of late, said managing partner Tracy Walker. Much like its [hybrid summer associate program](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/27/fly-fishing-and-all-night-layovers-how-mcguirewoods-got-face-to-face-with-summer-associates-despite-covid-challenges/), the policy in completely voluntary, Walker added.

“We have these 40 new people coming in, and like our summer associates we want an environment where they can excel,” Walker said. “Working remotely in teams is a lot easier when the team [members] know each other.”

Walker added that the firm made the decision in May to start its associates in the fall, after projecting its finances in the depths of the pandemic-induced recession. He said it was important that associates had the certainty and job security to hold them steady through the extremely uncertain summer.

Does Walker have any concerns about starting new associates in person? “Looking back now in mid-October, I believe we made the right decision,” he said.

# Folks, Let's Not Shame People For Getting Vaccines
## But, seriously, if you've got the vaccine, show a little decorum.

As everyone sits around waiting for vaccines to end their COVID nightmare, there’s a strong impulse to heap unending scorn on people getting vaccinated before you. Especially if those people go around publicly crowing about it. Seriously, old NFL celebration penalty rules apply: collect your vaccine and walk stoically back to the sidelines like a professional.

So if people post happy movies of their “[Biglaw firm] Vaccine Party!!” on their wall, we can embrace how unbelievably tacky that is and definitely ask why the hell they feel the need to name the firm as if it’s a cult that defines their very humanity, but we can’t really shame them for getting the vaccine itself.

I’ve gotten my first dose. As a dashing, vibrant, young writer who can work remotely indefinitely, that may not seem fair. But I have a genetic heart condition whose top identified symptom is “instant death,” so I get to be on the list. Lucky me! The point is that we don’t know what conditions the folks posting this might have and it’s a bit ableist to presume they don’t have something that makes them a priority.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Now, I certainly do wonder why the firm would find its name in a vaccine celebration. I like my employers but would never post “Above the Law Vaccine Party!!” anywhere. I mean, I guess I just did write those words, but you get my point. It kind of reads as if a major law firm used its connections to jump the line in a state whose vaccine rollout is infamously slipshod, in this case, a state that doesn’t prioritize K-12 teachers despite requiring in-person instruction for months. But the firm doesn’t control the governor’s office (well, actually given the governor involved and the firm involved, they might…) and if they can get people vaccinated at all it’s better than wasting vaccines like the state’s doing every day.

I understand the prioritization system but at the end of the day, everyone needs to go get their vaccine. “Herd immunity” got a bad rap because Donald Trump tried to use it as scientific cover for “doing absolutely nothing,” but it’s a real thing and it’s how vaccination actually works. Your individual vaccine may not stop the virus but everyone’s vaccines together cuts off its access to the hosts it needs to survive. I’d much rather see “[Biglaw firm] Vaccine Party!!” than the TikTok where an associate breaks down how Bill Gates invented COVID so he can microchip everyone. If I have to suffer through a gauche celebration video to know that people are at least being responsible, I’ll take it.

So as much as we’d all like to dunk on the classless display of a vaccine celebration party that may or may not be thanking the firm for getting you ahead of the line, we just can’t do it. This is a bad display, but we’ll just roll our eyes and thank you for taking the disease seriously right now when so many people aren’t.

I’m tired of it.

I’ve been doing this for too long to hear silly clients say the same things over and over again.

I got tired of repeating the same words to young associates, and I wrote [The Curmudgeon’s Guide to Practicing Law](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590316762/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590316762) so associates could read the book instead of forcing me to repeat myself.

Now I’m writing this column; maybe I can send it to silly clients and not have to repeat myself.

Silly clients: Don’t say these things!

First: “Sure, sue ’em! Just don’t go to court and lose.”

Look: Litigation is a crapshoot. I’ve never seen a case where my chance of winning was more than 90 percent or less than 10 percent. We sometimes lose cases that are a lock. And we sometimes win cases in which we have no hope.

Just don’t bet on it.

So I can’t tell you that we’ll go to court and not lose. I can tell you only that we’ll go to court and have a strong chance of winning.

Don’t ask for more than that.

Silly client.

Second: “Smitty says our competitor cheated! Why haven’t we sued ’em already?”

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Because Smitty says a lot of stuff. Some of it’s true; some of it’s not. Before we go into court, I’d like to confirm, if possible, that Smitty is speaking the truth this time. Better yet, I’d like Smitty’s version of the truth to be supported by contemporaneous written evidence. Please let me kick the tires before we sue.

Everybody has rumors; we need evidence. And the fact that Smitty says so isn’t evidence. (Well, technically, I guess, it is evidence. But Smitty is sure gonna look like a jerk on the witness stand when it turns out that his memory is dead wrong.)

So cool your jets.

Silly client.

Third: “I know the dispute is about an unrelated issue. But just stop paying him under the contract. That’ll increase our leverage!”

Yeah, it’ll increase our leverage. But it’ll also get us sued for breach of contract, and we’ll have no defense in that case.

If we’re mad at the other guy for reasons unrelated to the contract, we probably have to fight over the issue that makes us mad. We can’t just stop paying under the unrelated contract.

Doing everything we can to create leverage doesn’t always create leverage.

Silly client.

Finally: “We don’t owe him that money. Don’t pay him a penny! Not a penny!”

Maybe.

I’ve heard countless people who look just like you scream, “Don’t pay him a penny!” Six months later, when we’re paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in defense costs and we’re up to our eyeballs in discovery, those countless people are all asking, “Why the hell did we do this? What’s wrong with you?”

It ain’t me.

I know that we’re [mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGIY5Vyj4YM).

And for a very few issues — matters of principle for which we really will pay [“millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Goodloe_Harper) — we won’t pay a penny.

But for most cases, we’re doing a cost-benefit analysis. If we can get out of the case for a couple thousand bucks, and it will cost us tens of thousands to defend it, and we’re in a jurisdiction where the winning party doesn’t recover its legal fees from the loser, then we’re pretty unlikely to refuse to pay a penny. Paying a penny that you think you don’t owe may offend you, but it’s the way of the world.

Trust me. I’ve been there before.

But maybe you haven’t. Or maybe you have, and you don’t remember.

Silly client.

# 4 Best Practices For Biglaw Firms That Are Weathering The Storm Well
## What should successful firms be doing to reassure and support their employees during these tumultuous times?

Based on [recent headlines](https://abovethelaw.com/biglaw/), a casual observer could conclude that Biglaw is in a state of meltdown — but that wouldn’t be correct. As I said in a recent [interview with Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/david-lat-recovers-returns-to-an-industry-upended-by-contagion), although the legal industry currently faces “a time of uncertainty,” it’s “not in freefall.”

Take a closer look at the firms that have announced cost-cutting measures such as layoffs, furloughs, and compensation cuts. The roundups [here at Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-covid-crisis-law-firm-layoff-tracker-whats-your-firm-doing-to-survive/) and [over at the American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/20/pay-cuts-layoffs-and-more-how-law-firms-are-managing-the-pandemic/) list 76 and 70 firms, respectively. But a number of the mentioned firms are small firms, midsize firms, or even overseas entities. If you exclude those firms, you’re probably talking about, at most, a third of the Am Law 200.

The fact that most Am Law 200 firms have not had to implement any cost-cutting measures suggests that a significant number of Biglaw firms are weathering the current storm reasonably well. To be sure, the list of firms engaged in belt-tightening grows each week, and many analysts believe that we’re seeing only the tip of the iceberg. But it’s also worth noting that [several firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-biglaw-firms-rolling-out-good-news-for-now/?rf=1) feel comfortable enough with the condition of their coffers to announce to their employees that they will not be cutting salaries or conducting layoffs.

Now, these “no layoffs” assurances aren’t legally enforceable, and those of us who were around during the last recession can recall how some firms that made such promises wound up going back on them. But it’s safe to say that at least some firms will emerge from the current crisis relatively unscathed, as is the case with pretty much every downturn.

For firms that are in the fortunate position of holding up well, here are four recommendations for how to use the current crisis to enhance employee loyalty, burnish your firm’s reputation, and do the right thing:

1. Make gestures of generosity, if you can afford them.

These are trying times for many American families. And while households with at least one Biglaw lawyer or staff member are among the most fortunate, this doesn’t mean that they’re immune to economic difficulty.

Imagine a family of four where one parent is a Biglaw administrative assistant and the other parent just got laid off from a job as a restaurant manager. Or picture a family that’s a bit more privileged, a Biglaw associate married to a journalist who, while not laid off, just got [hit with a pay cut](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/business/media/news-media-coronavirus-jobs.html). These families still have kids to support and bills to pay — and they could even have unanticipated new costs, such as medical bills related to coronavirus treatment.

They could use whatever help they can get from the firm. So kudos to those firms that have stepped up to the plate with such measures as [bonuses to help out with unexpected expenses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/prestigious-firm-bucking-the-covid-19-austerity-trend-with-special-bonuses-and-tech-budgets/?rf=1) or [technology stipends](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/covid-19-tech-stipends-all-the-rage-in-biglaw/) to help employees work more efficiently from home.

Even more modest measures go a long way in terms of increasing employee appreciation and loyalty. For example, some firms have sent meals or care packages to employees who they knew had, or had a family member who had, COVID-19. These gestures aren’t expensive, but they are deeply appreciated by those who receive them.

2. Be understanding and flexible regarding the challenges your employees face.

My colleagues and I speak to many associates in our roles as legal recruiters. These days, because lateral hiring of associates has slowed, many of our conversations are check-ins, as opposed to discussions about specific jobs.

I checked in recently with one associate who expressed some frustration about their firm. The firm seems to be doing well and hasn’t announced any austerity measures. But what this associate found frustrating is the firm’s acting as if it’s “business as usual” — when, for many associates, it’s not.

This associate is a working parent, and their spouse works as well. They have a young child and, because of the quarantine in New York, no child care. They’re both working remotely while also dealing with the added challenge of caring for their child, which means that getting work done is much harder than usual. It would be nice if the firm acknowledged the challenges that associates and staffers face right now — in terms of child care, elder care, or sick family members, to name a few — and reassured them that the current circumstances would be taken into account when evaluating performance.

For example, take the issue of billable hours. Should billable-hour requirements be waived or pro-rated to reflect the difficulty of accumulating billables while dealing with many other priorities? It’s an issue firms should start considering, even if the end of the year is still far away.

3. Communicate, communicate, communicate.

This point flows from the preceding one — and, unlike giving a tech stipend or pro-rating hours requirements, it costs a firm truly nothing. When in doubt, firms should communicate more rather than less; a little communication goes a long way.

Even during normal times, law firms have never gotten high marks for transparency. And in times of great uncertainty and anxiety for lawyers and staff, clear communications about where the firm stands and what its plans for the future are matter more than ever. We certainly know that associates at [firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/biglaw-firm-assures-associates-they-will-not-cut-salaries-or-furlough-lawyers/) that have been [more transparent](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-biglaw-firms-rolling-out-good-news-for-now/) greatly appreciate their firms’ honesty, openness, and reassurance.

4. Step up your pro bono game.

During difficult times like these, the need for pro bono work is greater than ever. And because of the slowness that at least some lawyers and practice areas are experiencing, many lawyers have more free time to spend on pro bono matters.

A number of firms have risen to the occasion. For example, some [34 law firms](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/03/27/law-firm-coalition-launched-national-pro-bono-campaign-to-support-small-biz/), including Kirkland & Ellis, Willkie Farr, Goodwin, and Covington, have joined together with the Lawyers for Good Government Foundation to help small business owners navigate the complexities of the federal government’s COVID-19 stimulus package (which isn’t easy to figure out, as explained in this [client memo](https://www.bsfllp.com/news-events/federal-government-updates-paycheck-protection-program-creating-significant-regulatory-risk-for-borrowers.html) by Jesse Panuccio and Simon Leen of Boies Schiller). The small-business pro bono program got started here in New York City, where Kirkland & Ellis pro bono counsel Jacqueline Haberfeld and other law firm representatives approached the City Bar Justice Center with the idea.

As Brad Karp, chairman of Paul Weiss — a longtime leader in pro bono work, which in March launched an online [Coronavirus Relief Center](https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/transactional/coronavirus-covid-19-relief-center/practice-overview/relief-center) to help individuals and small businesses — put it in a recent [Q&A with Law.com](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/05/04/paul-weiss-rifkind-wharton-garrison/), “Millions of Americans face economic ruin; gratuitous actions by state and federal authorities put inmates, migrants and others at extreme risk; and our democratic institutions are being undermined. If we, as lawyers, don’t step up to safeguard the rule of law and those in need, who will?”

The answer should be: all law firms and lawyers. Yes, it’s important for law firms to look after and support their own people during these trying times. But it’s also critical for Biglaw firms, who are in a relatively privileged position compared to many other businesses and industries, to look beyond themselves and to help their communities and country.

At some point in time — hopefully sooner than later, although right now it’s anyone’s guess — the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout will be behind us. If you’re a law firm leader, you’ll be asked, “What did you and your firm do during the crisis?” So take actions today that will allow you to answer this question with pride tomorrow.

# More Law Firms Should Schedule Happy Hours For Attorneys And Staff
## If law firms are inclined to host law firm happy hours, a few things should be kept in mind to ensure success.

Now that law firm offices are reopening after the COVID-19 pandemic, attorneys are beginning to socialize more like they did several years ago. Many lawyers are informally catching up with coworkers, and this has a positive impact on morale and fostering a team spirit at law firms. Some law firms sponsor regular happy hours for their associates so that people who work at a firm can interact in a more casual setting. More law firms should consider sponsoring such events since they can make it more fun to come to an office and can help attorneys interact outside of a typical office setting.

Before starting my own law firm about four years ago, I worked at a few shops that had regular law firm happy hours. When I was in Biglaw, I worked at a shop that had a huge happy hour on the third Thursday of every month. I think that the law firm called this “Third Thursdays” or something similar. The happy hour took place inside our office in a space that was used for social settings, and it usually included a selection of beer, nonalcoholic beverages, and a bunch of solid food offerings.

I really looked forward to Third Thursdays, since it was a good time to unwind and relax with coworkers. Such an event could lead to interactions with people that attorneys might not typically see and getting to know coworkers on a deeper level. I would be remiss if I did not mention that Third Thursdays [made the pages of Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/05/former-d-c-biglaw-staffer-sues-alleging-nasty-combination-of-drinking-and-choking-at-work/) for misconduct that allegedly occurred at this event, and safeguards need to be in place to ensure that people have fun responsibly during such activities. However, on the whole, this firm-sponsored happy hour was a great way to interact with coworkers.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
At another firm at which I worked, the happy hours were much less formal. On Friday afternoons, the law firm administrator would run to the Duane Reade drugstore across the street from our office and pick up some snacks and adult beverages. She would then go through the halls inviting anyone who was in the office on a Friday afternoon to a happy hour held either in the conference room or the managing partner’s office.

You might think that people just wanted to leave the office on a Friday afternoon and get on with their personal lives. But each week, I was shocked that a sizeable number of the attorneys and staff stayed at the office for an hour or two after working hours to drink and eat with their coworkers. This was a really good way for associates to get into the partners’ good graces, and at that firm, making connections with partners was important to getting favorable assignments. However, it was also fun for the associates to interact with each other at the law firm happy hours. I still keep in touch with tons of people from that law firm, and this could be because of the firm culture cultivated by those happy hours.

If law firms are inclined to host law firm happy hours, there are a few things they should keep in mind to ensure that they will be a success. For one, such happy hours should not take place in the office if at all possible. When people interact in an office setting, it is more difficult to be completely detached from work. However, when people interact at a bar or other similar setting, it is easier for everyone to focus on socializing rather than work. Sometimes, it is impossible to host happy hours outside of the office, either for financial or geographic reasons, but if possible, law firm happy hours should take place outside of the office.

Also, it is important that law firms make accommodations for people who do not drink due to religious custom, personal preference, and other reasons. Not everyone drinks alcoholic beverages. Some may feel pressured at law firm happy hours to drink alcohol to be part of the group, and this should be avoided as much as possible so everyone feels as comfortable as they can be at such events.

All told, law firm happy hours can have a number of benefits, and more shops should consider holding such events. Law firm happy hours can lead to an improved law firm culture and can build team spirit that can help ensure attorneys and staff are better able to serve clients.

# Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries... For Junior Associates
## Associates don't seem happy.

I’ve [said it before,](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/jones-days-225000-starting-salary-for-associates-is-not-actually-above-market/) and I’ll say it again: the easiest way to keep associates happy (re: compensation) is matching the market rate in a lockstep fashion. If you black box most associates’ salary numbers, well, there’s bound to be discontent.

That’s why, even though the Biglaw firm of Lowenstein Sandler announced raises, not everyone is thrilled.

See, it’s kind of a mixed bag. The good news for associates — well, first, second and third year associates anyway — is that the firm matched the market standard. Everyone else’s base compensation changes will be communicated individually. And, according to tipsters at the firm, folks aren’t happy:

Lowenstein Sandler matched for first three associate classes and then went to individual comp for more senior attorneys. The firm is known for paying more senior attorneys $10-50k less than market. Mid-level and senior associates (and counsel) are not happy and there are rumblings of many associates looking for new positions if the firm doesn’t increase salaries by the same amount of the new market increase (or match market).

Adding to the distrust is an updated bonus policy. The firm streamlined the process, but in a[ sample bonus grid](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/lowenstein-raises-22/3/) shared with associates, only the highest performers match the market rates. As a tipster complained:

The firm also amended its bonus structure, which is below market except for the highest performers.

Last year the firm stated it wanted to compete for the best talent, but it appears that they can’t, or won’t, compete with the best firms when it comes to salary.

The raises are retroactive to January 1. You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/lowenstein-raises-22/2/)

It’s 2016, so I’ll skip the intro and assume you understand that a firm’s website is important. The online representation of your brand is relevant for clients and potential clients, recruitment, and the overall reputation of the firm. But getting the perfect website, isn’t as easy as just wishing one into existence.

At the [Legal Marketing Association’s annual conference](http://www.legalmarketing.org/conference) this week, there were plenty of opportunities to learn about the value of a kickass website. And not a moment too soon, as it seems a lot of firms are undergoing a website redesign.

Amidst all the redesign going on in the industry, it makes sense that not every firm would hit it out of the park. But one Biglaw firm recently hit the reset button on their online presence, and not everyone is happy. We received this complaint from a tipster:

Cleary Gottlieb inexplicably redesigned their previously elegant website to what can only be described as what-the-actual-f**k? It looks like an ADHD 10-year-old kid from 1995 designed the layout on his $24.95 per/month AOL subscription. As an incoming associate, I am now afraid to tell people which firm I am going to for fear that they may Google them and see this nonsense. I am going to start a petition at change.org, please join me!

Why don’t you tell us how you really feel, buddy? And I’m not so sure a 48.8Kb/s dial-up connection could handle the flashy graphics. So what’s the big redo that’s creating buzz? Well, [here](https://www.clearygottlieb.com/) is the site:



The still image doesn’t reflect the rotating images on the homepage, which can be annoying. Besides that, the branding seems a little understated, and when you click on the [attorney bios](https://www.clearygottlieb.com/professionals?position=c34ba845-4e8c-4514-bc0e-30118bc532d4), the pictures seem quite a bit bigger than the understated square that white-shoe firms usually use. Not my favorite website, but I don’t think it signals the end of times like our tipster does.

So, who’s right? Here is your chance to let the Biglaw firm know what you really think.

What do you think of Cleary Gottlieb's new website design?

- Love it!
- Fine... just fine.
- Too flashy for a Biglaw firm.
- Terrible, awful and no good.

# Law Firms Should Be More Open To Office Closures In The Post-Pandemic World
## The collective experience of the legal industry since the pandemic shows how foolish it is to keep offices open when the safety of employees is at stake.

As more and more law firms return to offices, people can start to imagine a life when the pandemic is finally behind us. Of course, the pandemic might be far from over, and we all face challenges before we can finally return to as close to the pre-pandemic normal as possible. Nevertheless, it is not too early to imagine how law firms will operate in the post-pandemic world. Although law firms will likely adopt many lessons from the pandemic in how they operate moving forward, perhaps most importantly, law firms should definitely change their approach to office closures for inclement weather, holidays, and other occasions.

As mentioned in a previous article in this column, some law firms used to [take a dim view of closing the office for inclement weather](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/will-some-law-firms-reopen-their-offices-too-soon/). Don’t get me wrong, I have worked at a few firms that were run by managers who genuinely cared for the safety of their employees and shut offices for inclement weather all the time so workers did not have commute on dangerous roads. Indeed, I once worked at a firm in which one partner was proud of his “one flake policy” that enabled attorneys and staff to work at home whenever it snowed even a little so no one had to make the difficult choice to decide if it was too dangerous to commute to the office.

However, I also worked at firms that did not close the office for inclement weather in almost any circumstances. Indeed, I once worked at a firm that wouldn’t even give employees an early dismissal so that they could hit the road if it started snowing in the middle of the day. I heard a story that some of the staff members at this firm had to camp out at a nearby bar after the office closed until well into the night because management at the firm would not let them leave early to avoid the weather.

Before the pandemic, bosses were more likely to keep offices open during inclement weather because they knew that people would be less productive if they worked from home. Before work-from-home became ubiquitous in the legal industry, it was difficult for attorneys and staff to complete meaningful work outside of the office. Many firms did not issue lawyers work laptops, so it was difficult for attorneys and staff to access the firm applications that were necessary in order to complete work tasks.

In addition, it was more difficult for attorneys and staff to collaborate and work together to complete projects. Before the pandemic, no one had ever heard of Zoom or any of the other remote work applications that have become commonplace since the stay-at-home orders were issued earlier in the pandemic. People used to be much more off the grid, and it was difficult to work together to complete projects or to be given work if people did not come into the office, even for a few days.

However, people have become accustomed to working from home, and firms have empowered employees to be just as productive at home as they are in the office. Law firms have mostly operated remotely for over a year and a half, and many law firms had very profitable years over this time. Moreover, most of the concerns about work-from-home were proven to be overblown, as there is not much of a productivity dip with having attorneys and staff work from home than come to the office.

If law firms can learn how to operate while employees work from home for extended periods, they can surely close offices for a day or two for inclement weather. This amount of time is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of time people worked remotely throughout the pandemic. Managers will seem more coldhearted than usual if they refuse to close offices for inclement weather like they did in the past since the collective experience of the legal industry since the pandemic shows how foolish it is to keep offices open when the safety of employees is at stake.

Moreover, law firms should be much more willing to close offices for other occasions as well. I have worked at some offices that would give days off before and after major holidays, and other offices that would give employees a day off during the week if a major holiday fell on a weekend. I have also worked at law firms that did not provide many days off and kept the office open as much as possible. Moving forward, hopefully law firms will be more charitable about when to observe holidays and close offices for holidays and other types of occasions more often.

All told, the experience of the pandemic has shown the legal industry that people can work from home for extended periods without much impact on productivity. As such, law firm managers should be more open to closing offices in a variety of circumstances.

# Making Partner Is Not As Awesome As You'd Think
## Not all partners in Biglaw are created equal.

For many attorneys, becoming a partner at a well-regarded law firm is a major career milestone.  Numerous lawyers strive to become partners, since they want to be part of the management of a law firm rather than merely employees.  In addition, many attorneys think that becoming a partner will ensure that they [earn more money and live a more comfortable life](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/extra-money-main-job/).  However, from my own personal experiences, becoming a partner at many law firms is not as awesome as you’d think.

For one, partners at many well-regarded regional law firms do not make as much money as you might believe. Indeed, I recently had a conversation with a friend of mine who is in his mid-40s, and is a partner at a solid regional firm in the Northeast.  I was surprised to discover that this partner, who has been practicing law for almost 20 years, [earned less money than some first-year Biglaw associates](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/balance-side-hustles-main-job/)!

Another one of my friends recently told me that about a decade ago, he went from being a partner at a well-regarded law firm to joining a personal injury firm as an associate.  This attorney related that he now earned several times more money than he made when he was a partner at a solid regional shop.  My friend conveyed that he would much rather be making more money as an associate than simply having the title of being a partner.

These stories demonstrate how becoming a partner for many attorneys does not mean that these lawyers earn the amount of money you might think some partners make.  And without making additional cash, being named a partner is merely a formality that does not have a tangible impact on the lives of numerous attorneys.

Now, I know what you are thinking.  My friends were partners at smaller regional shops, and becoming a partner at a Biglaw firm is the “gold ring” that can bring status and riches to any attorney who reached this milestone.  However, not all partners in Biglaw are created equal.  As many readers of this column are likely aware, most Biglaw firms bifurcate their partnership ranks into equity partners and non-equity partners.

Non-equity partners are usually not entitled to share in the profits of their firms.  These profits can be substantial, and if you peruse the profits per partner of most Am Law 100 firms, you can easily see the amount of cash non-equity partners are not entitled to even though they are called partners.  Rather, non-equity partners typically receive a set salary, which is sometimes not that much higher than the salaries of senior associates or counsel.

Of course, non-equity partners might sometimes earn origination bonuses for work they bring into a shop.  However, if non-equity partners do not have a book of business, they might just be paid a set salary like any other attorney at a firm.  In addition, some firms do not allow non-equity partners to participate in many management decisions.  For all of these reasons, I have heard many non-equity partners describe themselves as “glorified associates” or “partners in name only,” since they do not enjoy many of the trappings of partnership.

Still, many might think that becoming an equity partner at a top firm is a worthy career objective.  However, becoming an equity partner has some serious drawbacks.  Most firms require equity partners to earn sufficient equity credits before they can be promoted to this position.  Then, equity partners must typically make capital contributions to their firms.  The cash that equity partners must contribute is usually hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many equity partners must borrow money to pony up this cash.  If an equity partner leaves their firm, they are usually only paid back this capital over a long period of time, limiting their departure options.

Furthermore, becoming an equity partner sometimes makes you liable for the debts of a law firm.  If a law firm goes under, equity partners could be forced to shell out significant sums of money in order to pay creditors of your old shop.  This happened to many of the equity partners who were associated with Dewey LeBoeuf, [as this website covered at length](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/08/dewey-have-data-on-how-much-partners-got-paid-yes-thanks-to-the-partner-contribution-plan/).  In addition, if a law firm goes under, equity partners must usually kiss their capital contributions goodbye.  There are also a number of other hassles associated with being an equity partner, including less predictability about how much you earn, paying for your own health insurance, and other issues.

In the end, I am not sure why so many people are fixated on the title of “partner” in the legal profession.   When evaluating if partnership is something you want to pursue, you should not focus merely on the status of becoming a partner.  Rather, you should carefully consider how much money you will earn as a partner, and what the terms of a partnership agreement will be, since making partner is oftentimes not as awesome as you’d think.

# Akin Gump Surprises Associates With 'Good News': Fall Bonuses!
## Many firms have refused to pay out bonuses, but not this one.

Could it be? Is there a Biglaw firm out there that’s bold enough to offer its associates a fall bonus after Cravath put the kibosh on doling out cash before the end of the year?

Yes! Finally!

Akin Gump — a firm that came in at No. 34 on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, with $1,135,014,000 in gross revenue — has bucked the trend and is matching Davis Polk’s generous scale. In an email entitled “Good News and Appreciation,” chair Kim Koopersmith acknowledged her attorneys’ dedication during these difficult times, writing, “You have been making extraordinary contributions in the most challenging of circumstances. In recognition of your dedication and contribution to our firm, we will be paying a special fall bonus to our associates and counsel in good standing.”

In case you’ve forgotten what the DPW scale looks like (and you probably have by now since it’s been so long), here it is:

- Class of 2019: $7,500
- Class of 2018: $10,000
- Class of 2017: $20,000
- Class of 2016: $27,500
- Class of 2015: $32,500
- Class of 2014: $37,000
- Class of 2013+: $40,000
(Flip to the next page to see the full Akin bonus memo.)

Associates are thrilled as can be. “Nice to see Akin Gump ignore the trend of firms refusing to pay this bonus—especially considering how busy everyone has been this year and how well the firm has done,” said one associate. “Feels great, especially for those of us in exceptionally busy practices,” said another.

# Responding To The Pandemic: Resources For Attorneys Working Remotely
## Take a moment to appreciate all that you were able to accomplish remotely today.

Replicate What Works Best For You

There may be as many articles advising on best practices to work from home as there are attorneys in the workforce. While some suggestions are less applicable to legal work than others, often the simplest approach is best: take stock of what about your workplace makes you productive and do your best to replicate those qualities at home.

For starters, it’s paramount to have structure and get into a daily rhythm. Stick to your regular morning routine, eat breakfast, and pause to appreciate the extra time you have since you are not commuting today.  If you are a morning gym person and now find yourself without a facility due to the temporary closures, try to do some sort of physical activity whether it is outside — with proper social distancing — or at home with or without gym equipment.  If your body is accustomed to morning exercise, a sudden shift away from this habit may throw your day off balance more than you initially realize.

Next, you’ll want to assess how your work-from-home environment compares to a normal day at the office.  Are you used to a relatively quiet office with few interruptions but now have family members, especially young children, who are competing for your attention? You may need to shift to start working a bit earlier and accept that you will need more frequent breaks to attend to your family’s needs.  Creating schedules for your school-age children and sticking to them on the weekdays will give them much-needed structure by making it feel more like school. Temporarily loosening screen-time restrictions may also be a worthwhile tradeoff for the time being.

Conversely, are you used to a relatively busy office and now find yourself in a quiet apartment?  You may instead need to build in some interruptions to make your day progress more “normally.” One method that many who work from home have found focuses their attention and energy is the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). In short, this calls for you to plan your work as much as possible in 25-minute chunks (“pomodoros”), each followed by a 3-5 minute break.  After several pomodoros, you should take a longer break (15-30 minutes). Use the time to refresh your coffee, check your messages, or do whatever you would normally do at the office for a quick break. The relative shortness of the working time allows you to maintain focus while the breaks will make your day seem more like a busy day at the office with regular interruptions.

In addition to the strictly work-related conversations you have in an office every day, any communal workspace also provides daily “watercooler moments.” We may not realize how valuable these interactions are until a situation like a sudden shift to working from home occurs.  Find some time throughout the day to recreate these moments by checking in on co-workers to maintain a sense of cohesion in a chaotic time. Even better, if you have a scheduled team call, make an effort to spend a few minutes to ask how everyone is doing instead of jumping right into business.

Move. Whether it’s a walk around the block with your dog, checking on the kids in another room, or even doing a few stretches, for many people working from home means more sitting than your body may be used to.  Listen to your Apple Watch, set a reminder on your phone, or just make a point to stand every hour.

Set “defined” boundaries and endpoints for your work.  For attorneys, this is easier said than done, but working from home means work can naturally stretch more easily into family and dinner time than if you had to leave the office and commute.  If you can, close your laptop, ask the family how they’re doing–or, if you live alone, check up on a friend who is also working from home alone–and revisit work emails after what would be your usual break to commute home.

Finally, for those accustomed to being in an office, it can be difficult to appreciate all the work you’ve actually accomplished in a day if you’re doing it in a room next to where you had your breakfast.  Take a moment to appreciate all that you were able to accomplish remotely today and take a moment to appreciate that your job affords you this luxury.

Mental Health Resources

With the shift to remote-working and social distancing comes the potential for increased isolation and loneliness and it is important to maintain good mental health.  Mental health professionals have offered specific guidance. As ATL recently detailed[ here](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/lawyers-and-legal-professionals-must-care-for-their-mental-health-amid-covid-19-crisis/), some suggestions by law firm mental health consultant and certified alcohol and drug counselor Patrick Krill are to limit pandemic-related news and media intake to combat anxiety, and as lawyers already have an increased risk for isolation and loneliness, it is important to schedule and follow-through on times to check-in with family and friends via video.   National and local bar associations also offer mental health resources for attorneys. The ABA Commission on Lawyers Assistance Programs has a centralized online[ COVID-19 mental health resource center](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/resources/covid-19--mental-health-resources/) with a range of mental health resources for legal professionals during COVID-19, including information on crisis support lines, online support groups for depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, articles and books on coping strategies, and guidelines for law firm operations and management.  The[ Lawyers Depression Project](https://www.lawyersdepressionproject.org/) also offers a confidential forum and bi-monthly online peer to peer support group meetings for those in the legal profession suffering from depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.

We are also grateful to see many firms implementing wellness and mental health initiatives, including resources such as licensed therapists, certified coaches, meditation programs, billable hour credit for time spent on mental health/mindfulness, and having dedicated firm-wide directors of well-being.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 09.27.19
## * ""You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?"" According to President Donald Trump, the person or people who gave information to the Ukraine whistleblower is ""close to a spy,"" and should be handled “a little differently than we do now.” Alrighty then! [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/us/politics/trump-whistle-blower-spy.html)] * Not to worry, because Trump says, “There should be a way of stopping [the impeachment inquiry], maybe legally through the courts.” That’s not how this works. That’s not how any of this works. The Supreme Court cannot rescue you. [[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-stop/trump-says-there-should-be-a-way-of-stopping-impeachment-inquiry-perhaps-through-courts-idUSKBN1WB2DE)] * In other news, according to sources, the whistleblower is reportedly a CIA officer who at one point was detailed to work at the White House and learned of Trump’s conduct “in the course of official interagency business.” [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/us/politics/who-is-whistleblower.html)] * Baker McKenzie recently elected Milton Cheng, its Hong Kong managing partner, as the firm’s next global chair. He will be the firm’s first Asian chair. Congratulations! [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/09/26/baker-mckenzie-elects-hong-kong-head-as-global-managing-partner-405-45112/)] * Biglaw has been intently focused on diversity efforts among its associate and partner ranks, and now law firm professional staff are getting a chance to shine. To that end, Cooley plans to hire a manager dedicated to diversity and inclusion efforts just for staff. [[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/cooley-to-hire-diversity-manager-for-professional-staff)] * ""Wendi Adelson had a problem, and that problem was Dan Markel. The solution to that problem was Magbanua, Rivera, and Garcia."" Opening statements in the Dan Markel murder trial got off to an interesting start, with the late law professor's former in-laws playing a starring role. [[Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/09/26/opening-statements-in-trial-of-murdered-law-prof-present-stark-differences/)] * In case you missed it, the House of Representatives passed legislation that would allow banks to work with cannabis companies in states where it is legal. This is exciting news, so we should probably be prepared for it to die in the Senate.

# Rising From The Ashes: My Journey From Laid Off To Dream Job

I have a tattoo of a phoenix with its head held high, wings outstretched as if taking flight. It’s pretty cliché — okay, a lot cliché — but clichés resonate with us because they evoke imagery to which we can relate. The “phoenix rising from its ashes” image evokes hope, perseverance, and resilience. The phoenix was not my first tattoo, nor my last, but it was the one I spent the most time designing — trying to get it just right. Despite its being cliché, I sometimes feel like a phoenix: rising above after a challenge or ordeal only to be stronger and brighter as a result.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
From a surprise pregnancy at 17 during my parents’ divorce, to graduating from law school during an economically challenging time (with the student debt to prove it), to a difficult pregnancy, emergency C-section and newborn preemie in the NICU, to finding myself laid off from the job I thought I was going to have forever — I am no stranger to adversity.

After each of these tough experiences, I found myself stronger and more resilient than before. It seems — and here comes another cliché — that each of these hard things prepared me for the next hard thing.  In December 2018, I realized I had an opportunity to reinvent myself professionally, to pivot my career into something — hopefully — that would provide more stability.

As it happens, my husband had just started grad school — he is a disenchanted chemist, also hoping to pivot into something else. One day, he suggested I go back to school, too. I thought, “Obviously, this man is unhinged.” And then, “Or … maybe there is something to what he is saying.” My husband is no dummy — he didn’t just suggest it on a whim or out of the blue. He had done pretty extensive research on the job market, including both legal and legal-adjacent jobs. He researched grad school programs and certifications and laid it all out there. My husband convinced me to do something I thought I would never do: go back to school.

I knew I wanted to find a career — not just a job. I knew I wanted something challenging and interesting. I also knew I wanted to be in a role where I could grow professionally and at an organization that supported me. Of course, I also wanted a pay increase, but that was last on my list of priorities. Based on all of these things, I was surprised to realize that my “dream” job was now “cybersecurity incident response attorney.” The great thing about this dream is that there are many legal or legal-adjacent jobs related to cybersecurity — such as privacy attorney and privacy program manager — that would be great stepping stones on (or alternatives to) the path to my ultimate goal. However, I also knew that I couldn’t just start asking people to hire me — a psych major practicing workers compensation defense — for my dream job without having the credentials to prove my interest in this field. I talked over my plans with many people, including an attorney I looked up to who had pivoted from litigation to cyber insurance. She also encouraged my plan to go back to school.

So, 2019 was a whirlwind year for me. I was working — sometimes part time, sometimes full time or more, depending on the amount I was able to cobble together — and going to grad school full time. In May, my toddler was hospitalized for several days with RSV (a respiratory infection) and was on supplemental oxygen and IV fluids (he’s fine now). In June and July, my grandfather became ill, and we knew it was only a matter of time before he would say goodbye to us forever. A World War II Navy vet, his greatest fear at the end of his life was dying alone in a nursing home. Although I was incredibly busy, I was working and going to school remotely. As a result, I was able to grant my grandfather his last wishes: for the last five weeks of his life, I cared for my grandfather during the day while my dad was working out of the house and couldn’t be with him.

In December, I graduated from Virginia Tech with a Master’s in Information Technology (my bachelor’s is in psychology). Throughout the year, I studied for and obtained three privacy certifications through the IAPP (CIPP/US, CIPM, and CIPT). During the entire program but especially during that last month, I barely knew what sleep was, and I drank a worrisome amount of coffee. There was one particular day where I was attempting to juggle all of my competing responsibilities — work and school deadlines, sick kids — all with a 102-degree fever. I am not exaggerating when I say I seriously considered divorcing my husband that day.

Fast forward to March 2020. Schools and businesses were starting to close because of the pandemic. And I had just started a new job in a new practice area — my “dream” job. My story is not a blueprint. It is not a step-by-step guide on how to achieve your professional goals. Instead, my story is meant to give you hope. I am not going to lie — my professional “rising from the ashes” was not easy. It took a lot of work and effort, not to mention additional costs for the certifications and tuition. It also required belief in myself and in my dream. Of course, as in everything else I’ve ever achieved, it took the support of many people, family, friends, mentors, and colleagues. And it wasn’t immediate — it took time to build my credentials and find a position. But I am proof positive that if you put your mind — and your grit — to it, you can achieve your goals. Another cliché — but a true one, nonetheless.

So, if you find yourself at a professional crossroads — unhappy with your practice area, your workload, your hours; facing a lay-off or wanting to increase your salary; or simply just needing a change to reinvigorate your passion for being a lawyer — you can reinvent yourself just like I did.

Who is the worst in Biglaw? That’s what we’re trying to get to the bottom of in this year’s March Madness bracket. Voting is still open for the [first half of the bracket](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/who-is-the-worst-behaved-former-biglaw-attorney/) and now we are pleased to present the Infamous region and the Mel Gibson or Impulse Control region.



For the first matchup in the Infamous region we have a child trafficker versus a peeping tom. You can immediately see why we named it that…

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  

Edward De Sear

#1 Seed Name: Edward De Sear
(Former) Firm: Allen & Overy
Legal Specialty: Capital-Markets Partner
Misdeeds: This one is a doozy. De Sear pleaded guilty to four counts of distribution of child pornography and to sex trafficking of a child. He was sentenced to 17.5 years in jail, and ordered to pay $1.2 million in restitution to his victims.
[Why you should vote for him](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/it-gets-worse-ex-biglaw-partner-who-possessed-kiddie-porn-pleads-guilty-to-child-sex-trafficking/): “One has to wonder what kind of parents would sell their six-year-old son to a sex trafficker. And note that this transaction took place in Paris, not the developing world. (But such crimes can happen anywhere; France was the setting for the film Taken.)”

#4 Seed Name: Kelly Cross
(Former) Firm: Freshfields
Legal Specialty: Antitrust Associate
Misdeeds: Cross was convicted following an incident at a Washington Sports Club where he took surreptitious video of another patron’s buttocks and genital area. A fight broke out when the videotaping was discovered.
[Why you should vote for him](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/biglaw-voyeur-attorney-faces-the-music/): “Coincidentally enough, “chaos and an arrest” is the name of my failed punk band.”

Who should advance to the Elite Eight?

- # 1 Seed Edward De Sears (96%, 467 Votes)
- # 4 Seed Kelly Cross (4%, 22 Votes)
Total Voters: 489

The second matchup in this region pits two lawyers whose noteworthy clients (allegedly) got them in hot water.


Evan Greebel

#2 Seed Name: Evan Greebel
(Former) Firms: Kaye Scholar; Katten Muchin Rosenman
Legal Specialty: Corporate Partner
Misdeeds: Greebel was arrested, along with his former client, notorious pharma kingpin Martin Shkreli, on securities fraud charges. He was allegedly part of Shkreli’s scheme to use stock from his biotech company, Retrophin Inc., and to pay off unrelated debts.
[Why you should vote for him](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/pharma-karma-martin-shkreli-and-biglaw-partner-arrested/): “He specializes in mergers and acquisitions, corporate finance, and securities law. Yiiiikes, depending on how this case goes, he may have a whole new set of skills related to securities law.”

From Pilot and Above The Law  
#3 Seed Name: Jonathan Bristol
(Former) Firm: Winston & Strawn
Legal Specialty: Corporate Partner
Misdeeds: Bristol pleaded guilty to money laundering. His client Kenneth Starr — not the former Whitewater independent counsel, but the money manager to the stars — stole money from his celebrity clients in a Ponzi scheme. Bristol helped him clean up the money because he was “star struck” by Starr.
[Why you should vote for him:](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/12/lawyer-of-the-day-jonathan-bristol-winston-partner-turned-accused-fraudster/?rf=1) “Even though Winston may have (unwittingly) received laundered money, the firm emphasizes its innocence. The firm’s statement makes clear that ‘the indictment against [Bristol] is based on alleged conduct neither authorized by nor known to others at the firm’ and notes that Winston ‘is cooperating fully with the authorities investigating this matter.'”

Who should advance to the Elite Eight?

- # 2 Seed Evan Greebel (61%, 285 Votes)
- # 3 Seed Jonathan Bristol (39%, 183 Votes)
Total Voters: 468

# What You Need To Know About The Latest Technologies Impacting Health Care
## PLI is offering a one-day program that will address how today’s health care industry is harnessing emerging technologies as well as best practices for their use.

The pandemic had an impact on nearly every aspect of health care, accelerating the use of technologies such as telehealth, AI, and 5G, at an impressive pace.

As health care providers overhauled their systems to meet the new realities of seeing patients during a global pandemic, the industry saw a significant uptick in AI and other innovations — and was forced to confront data privacy, security, and IP questions. 

While advances in health care technology lead to better and more accessible care for patients, they can also pose unexpected challenges for health care organizations and technology developers, as well as the lawyers who represent them. PLI is offering a one-day program titled [Health Care Technology 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/health-care-technology?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), which will address how today’s health care industry is harnessing AI, data, cloud, 5G, and other emerging technologies, as well as best practices for their use.

In the program, a team of thought leaders will look at the future of health care IT and some of the hottest innovations we’re seeing today, outline best practices for negotiating or renegotiating health care IT agreements, touch on intellectual property issues, and tackle the issue of privacy and data security challenges. 

Other topics to be discussed include:

- The importance of upgrading IT Agreements for Digital Health
- How telehealth will be impacted by looking to lessons from the near future
- What to look for in health care cloud contracts
- Best practices for handling data privacy and cybersecurity
- What you need to know to assess apps, bots, and mobile devices       
The program will provide valuable information for attorneys representing or working as in-house counsel at health care organizations and life science companies. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/health-care-technology?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today.

# Ready... Aim... Bonuses!
## Biglaw, law school, and firing squads all in one show.

Biglaw bonuses are dropping and seem to confirm that most of the Biglaw world will get last year’s bonus check plus a little something extra to match the autumn COVID bonuses that a few heavy hitters previously announced. But where does that leave the industry going forward? Are we really going to see them backslide on compensation when there isn’t (hopefully) a year-long pandemic? Meanwhile, after initial fears of mass deferrals, law school applications are way up — which isn’t necessarily a good sign.

Finally, we talk about the Justice Department’s latest effort to bring back firing squads and why everyone needs to get over their visceral revulsion and ask, “Why does this bother me so much?”

# Biglaw Leaders Express Concern About Layoffs In 2023
## Layoffs en masse have already taken place. Will it happen again?

Given the lingering effects of COVID on lawyer morale, there’s even more reluctance to move into those kinds of layoffs and furloughs than before.

— Jim Jones, a senior fellow at the Georgetown University Law Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/13/whats-keeping-law-firm-leaders-up-at-night/), referring to the way leaders of Biglaw firms plan to broach the topic of layoffs in 2023 and beyond, which continues to be a top concern. referring to how firm leaders are handling the possibility of layoffs this year. “Indeed, if there is anything the legal industry’s reaction to the pandemic showed us,” Jones wrote in the latest [State of the Legal Market report](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/state-of-the-legal-market-2023/), “it’s that in the post-pandemic, return-to-the-office environment, it is crucial for firms to find ways to convey that they value the talent, skills and humanity of their lawyers and not just see them for their billable hours.” Several firms have already [conducted outright layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/), citing their [over-hiring in 2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) as the reason for the cuts.

# Federal Judge Disappointed Biglaw Attorneys Can't Display Basic Compassion
## The judge is unimpressed with the bad behavior from the Biglaw firm.

Listen, I have a lot of residual Catholic guilt rattling around in my head, so the “I’m not mad, just disappointed” tact works particularly well on me. But even without that baggage, you can hear the utter dismay of South District of New York Judge Paul Engelmayer dripping off of the page.

In Johnson v. Everyrealm Inc, plaintiff’s attorney Shane Seppinni requested a three-week adjournment on the matter from opposing counsel from Proskauer as his wife had unexpectedly gone into labor and delivered their child. Instead of recognizing the medical emergency that Seppinni is going through, the Biglaw attorneys attempted to extract concessions, not only in the current case but other cases against the same client currently in arbitration, saying, “they are ‘only willing’ to consent to the three-week adjournment requested by Mr. Seppinni if Mr. Seppinni meets five demands, only two of which relate to this litigation; the others relate to three separate lawsuits, now in arbitration, which Mr. Seppinni brought against Everyrealm on behalf of other clients.”

Let’s just say Judge Engelmayer is NOT pleased with the conditions the Biglaw attorneys tried to extract:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The Court congratulates Mr. Seppinni and his family on the birth of their child and wishes Mr. Seppinni’ s wife a speedy and full recovery. The Court reminds defense counsel of the expectation of the judges in this District that counsel will comport themselves with decency. Counsel’s attempt to exploit a moment of obvious personal exigency to extract concessions from Mr. Seppinni, in other litigations no less, was unprofessional. The Court expects better.

And Seppinni will get the time off to be with his family:

The Court unconditionally grants Mr. Seppinni’s request for a three-week adjournment for his opposition….This order is without prejudice to Mr. Seppinni’s right, in the event of continuing medical complications, to seek a further extension of these deadlines, as Mr. Seppinni’s email to the Court suggests may become necessary.

You can read the full order below, if you can stand the secondhand disappointment.

# Biglaw Firm Offers Associates Unlimited Billable Hours For Diversity & Inclusion Work
## Amazing! No other firm has offered anything that even comes close to this.

Biglaw firms across the country are implementing all manner of initiatives to bring attention to the importance of diversity and inclusion among their ranks. We’ve previously acknowledged [Dorsey & Whitney](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/biglaw-firm-introduces-diversity-hours-that-count-toward-associate-billable-requirements/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/care-about-biglaw-diversity-well-now-you-can-bill-for-it/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/5-concrete-steps-law-firms-can-take-to-advance-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-offer-billable-diversity-hours-for-all-timekeepers/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-25-biglaw-firm-offers-bonus-eligible-diversity-inclusion-billable-hours/), [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-5-biglaw-firm-raises-the-bar-on-billable-diversity-inclusion-hours/), [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-biglaw-firm-offers-associates-100-billables-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), and [Locke Lord](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/biglaw-firm-offers-associates-75-billable-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/) as firms where approved diversity and inclusion-related work will be billable for attorneys and will count toward bonus thresholds. We recently received word that yet another Biglaw firm rolled out a similar program in an effort to show just how dedicated it is to furthering diversity and inclusion within the legal profession.

There’s one very important difference about this firm’s program: there’s no hours cap whatsoever. Which firm is offering unlimited billable credit for attorneys’ diversity, equity, and inclusion work?

That would be Foley Hoag, a firm that brought in $223,512,000 gross revenue in 2019. Earlier this month, the firm announced that all attorneys and other timekeepers would be able to receive virtually limitless billable credit for their DE&I work as well as any and all legal recruiting activity. Here’s an excerpt from the firm’s memo on its new policy:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion is an integral part of the firm’s long-term strategic mission and goals.  The Executive Committee recognizes that the firm is at an important juncture in the advancement of its DE&I efforts.  A number of major internal and external DE&I initiatives have been launched over the past year. Many of our attorneys and other timekeepers are contributing significant time, effort and energy to these initiatives and the Executive Committee believes that crediting such time as billable hours is both appropriate and will enhance the firm’s efforts toward fulfilling our goals.  Because recruiting of new and lateral attorneys is also an integral part of the firm’s success, all time spent on legal recruiting activities will also count as billable hours.

There is no hours cap on the credit given for DE&I and legal recruiting activities, which is identical to our policy with regards to pro bono work.  Our goal is to fully recognize efforts spent advancing the firm’s DE&I initiatives and legal recruiting efforts.  We encourage all attorneys and other timekeepers to contribute in these areas, and suggest 25 hours each year as a minimum target.

Jeff Collins, Foley Hoag’s co-managing partner, emphasized to us that the firm’s new diversity billing policy doesn’t come with any “hurdle” expectations, meaning that there isn’t a set number of client billable hours that must be met before attorneys’ diversity, equity, and inclusion hours start to count. While other firms have reportedly taken this approach, Foley isn’t one of them.

Congratulations to Foley Hoag on its commitment to diversity, and for offering its attorneys a way to create a more inclusive workplace. With its virtually unlimited hours policy, the firm’s diversity billables are higher than every other firm that has announced such programming, including Baker McKenzie (125 hours) and Ropes & Gray (100 hours). What an admirable way to support diversity and inclusion efforts.

# Fourth Biglaw Firm Dumps Kanye West As Client
## He's being dropped like a hot potato!

Kanye West’s antisemitism continues to have repercussions for the rapper’s legal representation. West’s problematic behavior spans more than just the antisemitic rant that got him temporarily banned from Twitter — yeah, Elon Musk has already indicated Ye will be back on the platform. He also[ spread](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/19/1129747423/kanye-west-george-floyd-lawsuit) vicious, unfounded rumors that it wasn’t former police officer Derek Chauvin that caused George Floyd’s death but rather fentanyl — and as a result he is facing a $250 million lawsuit. Plus he wore a [“White Lives Matter” shirt](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/kanye-wests-white-lives-matter-drama-everything-to-know/) to his Yeezy fashion show.

And there have been consequences. He lost deals with Balenciaga and [Adidas](https://fashionista.com/2022/10/adidas-kanye-west-partnership-ending). He was dropped by Creative Artists Agency, and film and television studio MRC announced they were ditching a completed documentary on West. Now he’s been kicked to the curb by Biglaw firm Quinn Emanuel.

William Burck, Co-Managing partner, provided Above the Law with the following update regarding Quinn Emanuel’s representation of Ye:

“QE has withdrawn from representing Mr. West and will not represent him in the future.”

Well, damn. Kanye is 0 for 4 when it comes to Biglaw firms willing to sign up to represent him. First [Brown Rudnick decided they were done](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firm-passes-on-representing-kanye-west-after-rapper-refuses-to-back-away-from-antisemitic-remarks/) with Ye when he refused to back off of his antisemitic comments. Cadwalader — which previously represented the rapper in his separation from Gap —[ also dropped Kanye.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/second-biglaw-firms-dump-kanye-west-over-antisemitic-remarks/) And Pryor Cashman ended its [longterm engagement](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firm-parts-ways-kanye-west/) with Ye.

[Quinn’s representation of Ye became public ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/did-kanye-west-find-a-new-biglaw-firm-to-represent-him/)when the star posted what appeared to be a text message between himself and an attorney at the firm.

[](https://bit.ly/3e6NjRn)Trademark law has been increasing in popularity and importance in recent years, particularly as businesses were forced to shift and rebrand in the last year. Unfortunately, though, there have historically been very few offerings in the way of comprehensive training for attorneys who are just starting out with trademarks.

We recently sat down with Stacey Kalamaras, a seasoned trademark attorney and the founder of [Trademarkabilities](https://bit.ly/3sKUwui), an online trademark academy designed to fill that gap and give U.S. attorneys the comprehensive instruction they need to successfully handle trademark matters. Kalamaras shared her thoughts on why trademarks are so important, how attorneys can gain the confidence to handle trademark work, and more.

##Tell us a little bit about your background and how it led up to you founding Trademarkabilities.
My background is unique. I’m a second-career attorney – I spent my first career in marketing and advertising, building brands for multinational corporations, before I gave that up to go back to law school full time. I had really fallen in love with the area of brand management and was working with in-house counsel who do what I do now, and that’s where I learned what intellectual property law was. The prospect of making a living by legally protecting brands was fascinating to me. I decided to take all the institutional and industry knowledge I had and use it to become a brand protection lawyer.

##Why did you create Trademarkabilities?
When I started my career in Biglaw, I had access to some wonderful practitioners who gave me a lot of formal training. Adding that to my understanding of the business of brands from my previous career put me in a great position. I started my own firm in 2009, then went in-house where I met a lot of solo and small firm practitioners who were struggling without the type of training and mentoring resources I had in Biglaw.

I went back to Biglaw in 2014 and realized that the training I had received doesn’t exist as much anymore. While I think every firm has some sort of a training program, it’s now much less formalized than it was 15 or 20 years ago. Under client pressures to control rates, junior associates were also not getting the same early experience of working on interesting trademark portfolios, which is where you really learn by doing.

That led me to the idea for a more practical education format. I just needed to figure out the technology to bring it to the market, which I ultimately did in 2020 in the form of Trademarkabilities.

##How is Trademarkabilities different from other educational programs out there?
My approach is a very practical one, and it’s quite different from that of national CLE providers, for example. The practical approach really resonates with people, because it’s not just a lecture on what a case means or the latest update to some statute. It’s actionable information about what an IP attorney can do with a piece of information and how it impacts their practice.

The real idea of Trademarkabilities is to give anyone who has interest in trademark law – whether they’re brand new attorneys or someone who’s more experienced and who wants to add trademark prosecution to their practice – the opportunity to learn the practical side of practicing before the USPTO. We start with the rules, but we go beyond that with practical strategies and tips to help the practitioner understand the concepts more fully. We also provide screen shots of USPTO forms and client communication templates.

Some of our attorneys have described the program as “a trademark practice in a box.” I want to make it as easy as possible for the attorney to set up a trademark practice if they’re new to practicing trademark law. To date, I’ve educated over 3,000 attorneys on various trademark and IP issues.

##Who can benefit from Trademarkabilities?
Anyone who is dedicated to trademark law. We’ve had everyone from solo and small firm attorneys to in-house attorneys to attorneys at IP boutiques or larger firms. In the firm setting, junior attorneys want to do well and advance their careers. No matter how great their mentors are, though, no partner is going to have time to devote the hours and the level of detail that we give in the course.

We go into great depth and cover the entire trademark prosecution process from beginning to end. It’s meant to be comprehensive and something attorneys can grow with, regardless of their experience level when they start.

##Why is trademark education so important?
Trademarks are an incredibly important business asset. If you look at the filings at the USPTO, trademarks have been growing in popularity over the last five years, largely because trademarks are becoming more accessible to businesses of all sizes. There was also a huge increase in trademark filings during the pandemic, because people were forced to pivot and form new businesses. All this means that more and more clients are starting to ask their attorneys about trademark issues.

Any attorney barred in any state can practice trademark law in the U.S., but most lack the training to do it, so they end up referring this business elsewhere. And the fact that the U.S., unlike most other countries, doesn’t have a competency test (like the patent bar, for instance) for trademark practitioners makes it more difficult for practitioners to learn the area well. Part of the reason for setting up Trademarkabilities was to make sure that people really understand how nuanced this area is and to ensure they can represent their clients confidently.

##How does the course work?
Our signature course is a 10.5-hour course. We also have an introductory course if people just want to dip their toe in. Trademarkabilities is a video-on-demand course, which means you can take as much time as necessary to complete the course on your schedule. The videos are viewed on our learning platform, which can be accessed as often as you want, via your computer or mobile devices. You also get a complete workbook of the slides that go with the course, as well as templates that can be downloaded and customized to suit your firm’s needs.

We also offer additional resources for anyone who signs on to the signature course, including monthly, live Q&A sessions that I run and a closed Facebook group where people enrolled in the course can post questions and get feedback. The signature course is CLE-certified in the state of Illinois, which says something about the level of the substance of the course.

##What should people know about pricing?
The course is $2495, which I think is an exceptional value for all of the tools and resources that you’re given. There’s no other course out there of this length that goes anywhere near as in-depth as our course. Our pricing is comparable to what you’d pay for one- or two-day sessions from other providers that only give you an overview of the topic.

We offer discount pricing for additional enrollees from the same firm. I welcome any firm leaders who are interested in outsourcing their trademark training to please [contact me](https://bit.ly/2QN2BSr). We do customized training for five or more people at the same firm and would be happy to speak with anyone about how we could be a resource to train junior trademark attorneys at their firm.

##What can attorneys expect to get out of Trademarkabilities?
We want to help attorneys who are new to trademark law gain confidence in representing their clients and not have to turn this work away. We understand that, particularly when you’re on your own without that safety net of more experienced practitioners around you, it can be scary to learn a new area of law. At Trademarkabilities, we can be that safety net for you.

We help to build your skillset and, more importantly, confidence, so that you don’t ever have to turn away business that you want to take on. There’s no reason you can’t do trademark work, but you do need to learn the fundamentals first. We provide the fundamentals and much more.

Judge Nicholas Garaufis (E.D.N.Y.)

The big Biglaw story of this week: the benchslap that Judge Nicholas Garaufis (E.D.N.Y.) doled out to Kirkland & Ellis, and its aftermath. To recap: last week, Judge Garaufis [harshly reprimanded a K&E associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/judge-reams-junior-associate-because-biglaw-firm-refused-to-send-a-partner-to-court/) over the fact that the firm didn’t send a partner to cover the initial status conference in a case before him (a lawsuit accusing Facebook of facilitating terrorism through its social-media platform). The judge got some [criticism](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/was-this-judges-reprimand-of-kirkland-ellis-justified/) for this move. On Tuesday, Kirkland and Facebook [sent a huge team](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/judge-garaufis-placated-by-kirkland-ellis-and-facebook/) to Judge Garaufis’s court and apologized; Judge Garaufis apologized back, and everyone was “friends” again.

For those of you who can’t get enough of this story, there’s more: we now have the complete transcript of the Tuesday proceeding. We’ll pull out and discuss some highlights, but feel free to read the full document on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/judge-garaufis-v-kirkland-ellis-and-facebook-the-transcript/2/) (gavel bang: [@EricGoldman](https://twitter.com/ericgoldman?lang=en)).

Judge Garaufis actually apologizes first, right after the appearances of counsel:

I am glad to see you all here. Let me just say that. Any inference that might have been achieved through the media that I was ever upset at Mr. Burcher [K&E associate Aulden Burcher-DuPont] is totally unfounded and for that, I apologize if that is the impression that was given. I was much more concerned about the fact that the firm, your firm, would take this matter seriously on behalf of Facebook and I expected that either Ms. Barday or, if she couldn’t make it, someone would call and we would reschedule it because I believe that we ought to have the face of the firm, so to speak, in a situation like this.

It is only a pre-motion conference. I understand that, but any time the Court makes itself available, the Court may want to discuss things that aren’t on your minds but on the Court’s mind. So I just wanted to point that out to you and, hopefully, you know, we’ve crossed that bridge.

I don’t think it was the fault of “the media” that some people drew the “inference” that Judge Garaufis was pissed. The [transcript](http://nylawyer.nylj.com/adgifs/decisions16/092616transcript.pdf) speaks for itself.

And this doesn’t change the fact that associates who are duly admitted to a court should be able to fully address matters “on the court’s mind” (assuming no objection from the client). But still, it was nice of the judge to hold out this olive branch.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Kirkland & Ellis partner [Craig Primis](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=8994) responds in kind:

We hear you loud and clear. We apologize as well and we appreciate the Court’s comments. I want you to know that we feel badly that we didn’t have a partner here and, like Your Honor said, we would be happy to put this behind us.

I do want to mention one other thing. In light of the Court’s comments, we do have in the courtroom a representative from Facebook. His name is Paul Grewal. He is the vice president and deputy general counsel for global litigation. He flew out here from California in case the Court had any questions along the lines that came up last week and I would also note that Mr. Grewal is a former United States Magistrate Judge.

(A magistrate judge who was a [champion](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/judge-delivers-stinging-rebuke-to-partners-for-freezing-out-associates/) of associates [speaking in court](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/proof-that-law-firms-dont-really-care-about-associate-development/), by the way.)

Then we get an odd comment from Judge Garaufis about the career paths of his ex-clerks:

I don’t have any former clerks at Facebook. I have them at Google. I have them at Apple. For some reason, they have never made it over to Facebook and just don’t hold it against job applicants too that I took issue.

Not sure what the judge is trying to say here — a humblebrag about the career successes of his former clerks? — but anyway….

After some discussion of procedural history, the key issues in the case (or cases — two related cases), and the parties’ current intentions — Facebook will move to dismiss, which plaintiff’s counsel, Robert Tolchin, will oppose — Judge Garaufis got to this funny quip (emphasis added):

THE COURT: …. [T]he statute, the Communications Decency Act, does that cover developers of these algorithms that would bring together these different people or groups with these mutual interests?

MR. PRIMIS: Your Honor, you’re looking at Mr. Grewal. I’m happy to answer that question.

THE COURT: Well, he came all the way from California, he’s making the airlines rich, so I think it’s time for him to help the Court.

A humorous comment, given how Facebook — with an assist from the previously irate Judge Garaufis — is also making Kirkland rich. With three Kirkland partners and a Kirkland associate in court, Facebook’s meter must have been running at more than $3,000 an hour (assuming the firm didn’t cut Facebook a break on fees to the extent that the snafu was K&E’s “fault”).

But when a federal judge gets angry, he must be placated.

# How Law360 Pulse Explores The Human Side Of The Legal Industry
## Business of Law editor Martin Bricketto discusses the trends he'll be watching.

Martin Bricketto is a proud New Jersey native and current managing editor for Business of Law coverage at Law360, working with a talented team of writers to uncover and tell important stories relevant to the legal industry. Martin also oversees Law360’s legal industry and ethics sections, supporting the recently launched Law360 Pulse, which has become a leading source for legal news.

Martin sat down with the [Evolve the Law Podcast](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2021/09/27/evolve-the-law-podcast-martin-bricketto-of-law360/) in August to share details on some of the most important stories he’s covered this year, and provide insights on what to expect as law firms face reopenings and potential variants this fall. Martin also explains the importance of exploring the “human side” of legal industry news, and how his team at Law360 Pulse works tirelessly to find the legal stories that matter, helping to elevate the profession for all.

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

ETL: How have you seen Law360 Pulse evolve since the launch at the beginning of this year?

It’s really fun because I had overseen legal industry coverage before the launch of Pulse and our staff’s awesome.

Aebra Coe, who’s now an editor-at-large, and Michelle Gorman, who covers in-house issues for us — they were part of our legal industry coverage and they just did a killer job.

But there was always stuff we couldn’t get to. Now, there’s just more we can cover, which is very exciting.

I think what people have seen is expanded coverage of personalities across the industry, who we’re really fascinated by. And things like more Q&A’s and profiles.

ETL: Have any stories come up recently that have just been particularly interesting to you? 

I would highlight Brandon Lowrey’s work on the Tom Girardi case. Tom Girardi is a famous plaintiffs lawyer out in California, who has come under fire for allegedly stealing, losing — whatever you want to call it —plaintiff funds from all these settlements.

It’s just a total mess and there’s also a celebrity factor to it because he’s married to a Real Housewife of Beverly Hills, right?

But at the end of the day, there are all these victims and families who allegedly lost a ton of money — and didn’t see money they deserve because of what may have been some serious misdeeds inside of a law firm.

It’s just a fascinating story that’s sad, and hopefully paves the way for some reforms that prevent future instances of this down the road.

And with the pandemic, I really can’t stress enough how fascinating I think the way firms are responding has become. 

ETL: Has any story been surprising to you?

I’ve been pleasantly surprised about how people do have an appetite for those more personality-driven stories.

We had a recent story, written by Ryan Boysen, about a federal clerk whose partner was diagnosed with cancer in the middle of her working in all these difficult clerkships. And it was fascinating because that ended up becoming a real support network for her.

And the story was really about how supportive the judges were during this very painful time. It did really well. I just thought that was really cool.

And I think that’s a green light for us to keep pursuing a variety of stories.

ETL: How do you go about finding those really great stories and telling them?

I think it’s a credit to our staff. I think you can give them a topic to explore and they find out that this wasn’t something known to us.

We’re aware of something — like the difficulty of women attorneys in particular, in the middle of the pandemic, and the responsibilities they may face at home increasing and the pressures of the legal career.

You give that to someone as a topic and the legwork they do to find people, to give voices to that sort of story — it’s really amazing every time.

I can think of a story that Cara Bayles, one of our people, wrote along those lines where the item was just full of really powerful individual stories that brought the whole thing home. And I think that’s the way you want to cover these big trend stories, right? You want to find people who are representative of it. 

ETL: What will be the big topics of conversation amongst lawyers and law firms as we roll into the fall?

Not to keep bringing up COVID, but I think it is going to be fascinating to see what happens with firms that do manage to hold those fall return-to-work dates.

What are they going to see in terms of implementation? What are they going to see in terms of attorneys responding to whatever hybrid models they’ve decided to adopt?

Eventually, I’m going to be really curious to see how real estate trends play out in certain markets, where it seems like firms might be poised to downsize space. We did a survey last year about real estate trends among law firms because of the pandemic, and D.C., for example, seemed like one area where firms might be looking to downsize space.

Also, the vaccine mandates.

And God forbid, if cases start climbing again, do we see a pullback from that returning to work? And of course, there’s the revenue element of this.

It seems like a very good year in 2020, despite everything — it seems like firms did well from a revenue perspective. Does that continue into 2021? Do we see a fourth quarter that kind of sets that up for the following year?

ETL: Anything new on the Law360 or Law360 Pulse side that’s coming up that you’d like to share with our readers?

I’ll probably be a little vague about it, but we’re going to keep going after certain topics for deeper dives for series.

And then, a bigger push will be some expansion of our coverage in specific areas. So, I would look for that near the end of the year, as well.

# Remote Flexibility v. Compensation: The Big Decision Associates Must Make
## For most associates, the choice is easy.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Does more flexibility in terms of expectations, hours and remote work become a recruitment and retention tool? In some cases, yes. But can firms outcompete other firms for talent because of flexibility… that hasn’t been proven.

What wins out: an additional $100,000 or remote work? For most associates, the compensation will probably outweigh the flexibility, given that most large firms still have high expectations.

— Kristin Stark, a consultant at Fairfax Associates, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/05/flexibility-is-a-talent-attractor-but-it-comes-with-its-own-challenges/), on the “big trade-off” between flexibility and compensation. “It’s about the percentage of talent that will make that trade off,” she said, “and it’s probably a relatively small population—not half or a quarter of the talent market.”

# In-House Counsel Reacts To Biglaw's 'Online 24/7' Expectations
## In-house really is the promised land.

Everyone who is in-house is saying, ‘This is why I work in-house.’ It’s a real attitude. There’s so much insecurity rooted in establishing a paradigm where he who works the most is the most valuable. When you’re early in your career, that is the paradigm that is reinforced because of the billable hour. It’s a problem that’s really plaguing Big Law especially.
For me, I’m aghast. As an in-house attorney, I’d never see this on a slide presented to any department at a company, let alone a legal department. You don’t want to set that expectation with employees because you’re just asking for an [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] claim.”

— Foster Sayers, general counsel at contract management company Pramata,[ told Law.com](https://www.law.com/2023/04/07/im-aghast-viral-paul-hastings-presentation-garners-strong-in-house-reaction/) that the advice a Paul Hastings senior associate was caught giving juniors ([that they need to be “online 24/7”, and other bad takes](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-training-presentation-says-you-are-online-24-7-and-thats-not-even-the-worst-advice/)) just wouldn’t fly in-house.
