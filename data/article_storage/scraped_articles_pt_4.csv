# Firm Goes Back And Does Right By Seniors Overlooked In First Raise Announcement
## All's well that ends well...

Norton Rose Fulbright was one of the last big firms to make the move and respond to Cravath’s new normal in associate compensation. Associates were already vocal about their frustration with waiting while every firm around them rushed to raise salaries. And when the firm finally did move — opting for the late-stage custom of raising first-years to $180K and keeping mum about everyone else — the [associates went ballistic](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/global-firm-irks-associates-with-subpar-salary-announcement/).

But there’s a happy ending to this story. Norton Rose Fulbright called a July 15 meeting to address compensation and showed the wisdom of an entity willing to admit it was taking its time to be cautious, thorough, and unafraid to admit it wasn’t right in the first place. After the recent meeting, it’s safe to say associates at the venerable verein are feeling a lot better:

The plan is a bit complex. That said, it’s fair, transparent, and uniquely tailored to the needs and personality of the firm (more on that below). No written materials were distributed, but I have summarized the basics of the plan below.

Years 1-3: full matching of Cravath scale, regardless of hours billed
Years 4-8: full matching of Cravath scale if average of billables for previous 2 years = 1,800+

Years 4-8 with a 2 year average below 1,800 stay on the old Simpson scale with the opportunity to earn a true-up bonus (bringing the associate to full Cravath scale for their class year) if 1,800 hours are billed in a year for which an associate is held back to the Simpson scale. The true-up bonus opportunity has no effect on regular annual bonuses–an associate held back to the Simpson scale who bills 2,000+ will receive both a true-up bonus and a regular annual bonus for that year. Another nuance is that 4th years whose 2 year average is below 1,800 get a raise to $215K or $220 (I can’t remember which) so that no one goes from a 3rd year to a 4th year without a raise. 4th years held back to the modified Simpson scale can still make up the difference to $235K with a true-up bonus by hitting 1,800 hours.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As I’ve said before, 1800 hours — for New York associates anyway — is not even a real limit, barring an extenuating tragedy taking one out of the office for a month or two. And an average of 1800 hours over two years means there’s really no way to miss this target and get the full Cravath scale. And these “true-up bonuses” appear to cover all the gaps.

But some associates, probably based on group and office, still see the 1800 mark as a problem:

Obviously associates with high billables will be satisfied with this while those who are below the target will be unhappy. Wondering how this affects attrition given that the same associates can lateral to another firm and make a lot more regardless of hours.

Still, I’m loathe to call averaging 1800 hours over two years “high billables.” Hell, I know people averaging 1800 hours over two six-month stretches.

Here’s how the firm discussed the way this system fits in with bonuses:

The new system was generally well received and associates are happy. Another high point in the presentation was an unequivocal statement that the new compensation system is not intended as a transfer from bonus to base comp (a common concern, unaddressed by many firms) and that the new compensation system would operate in addition to the [recently adopted bonus structure](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/associate-bonus-watch-norton-roses-new-compensation-scheme-smells-sweet-to-associates/).

That is a positive. Still, let’s not count our chickens. I continue to predict a crazy bonus season that continues to stretch the Biglaw haves from the have-nots. Perhaps I’m wrong, but let’s see how Cravath plays its next card.

In the meantime, one associate at least feels that Norton Rose may have rankled its people, but all is now forgiven:

From my vantage point, even the delayed announcement/effectiveness of the new compensation system is forgiven, because the result, while not quick or simple, was fair, reasonable, sustainable, and smart.

Well, did someone tell this person the raises don’t kick in until October 1? That’s a thing, isn’t it? I’m just not ready to live in a world where Norton Rose associates are happy.

# Looking For A Better Way To Collaborate? Put Your HighQ To The Test
## A powerful way to streamline and improve the delivery of legal services.

As the practice of law continues to go increasingly digital, lawyers and their clients are constantly on the lookout for a better way to communicate and collaborate on everything from simple information sharing to complex projects and transactions.

[HighQ](http://bit.ly/2PsMY0v) is that better way. A[ recent addition](http://bit.ly/2x7djsw) to the Thomson Reuters family, HighQ offers law firms and businesses a powerful way to streamline their collaboration and improve the delivery of legal services. With the HighQ platform, both sides of an engagement are empowered to be more effective, efficient, innovative, and proactive. In a sea of technology options, HighQ is the platform you need when you want to work smarter in today’s demanding and competitive legal market.

##The Power of HighQ
The folks behind HighQ started out with a mission that sounds simple enough: to transform the way law firms and corporate legal departments work and engage with their clients and colleagues. While the effort that went into creating HighQ might have been anything but simple, its developers succeeded in creating a sophisticated, user-friendly way to make collaboration and engagement a breeze, complete with efficient automation of legal processes and better management of complex projects and transactions.

HighQ works by offering a platform of many different capabilities that users can combine to solve their most pressing business problems. It offers seven core capabilities: document management, content management, task management, social collaboration, file sharing and syncing, smart forms and sheets, and a dashboard builder. Five additional capabilities – data visualization, document automation, enterprise knowledge management, AI, and workflow automation – can be added separately. All of these capabilities are built upon a foundation of security and compliance, auditing and reporting, and APIs and integrations, which extend throughout every aspect the HighQ platform.



You can think of each of these capabilities as the building blocks you use to customize your HighQ experience. Just pick and choose the functionalities you need to solve a specific problem or to handle a given project, then combine them in a template solution and hit deploy. All those capabilities are now packaged together for a given matter, and the template can be saved and redeployed for similar engagements in the future. The various building blocks can be combined and recombined in any number of ways to solve whatever problems might arise.

So, what can you do with HighQ? The answer is basically anything, but there are five overarching ways that law firms are using HighQ to engage with clients and improve business:

- Promoting the firm and attracting new clients
- Engaging current clients by adding value and insight
- Securely sharing content and communicating with external clients
- Delivering legal services and work product
- Working and collaborating internally on projects
HighQ also conveniently integrates with best-in-class solutions in a variety of areas, including document automation, AI, and document management, among others. With HighQ, you have the most advanced ecosystem of connectivity solutions available, meaning that it will quickly become your home base for all your legal work.

##How it Works
When you first log in to your HighQ platform, you see a main dashboard for a particular engagement, which can be specifically branded with the name of that client.



On the left is a list of projects (called sites), which serves as a sort of virtual filing cabinet for the engagement. In the center is a feed of your recent activity. If this reminds you of a social media interface, you’re not wrong – the feed offers social collaboration capabilities, such as likes and comments. On the right are your files and tasks, so you can easily find the things you’re working and any tasks that have been assigned to you (whether by you or created by someone else).

When you click into a file, you see it in an online viewer where you can add annotations, make redactions, and view metadata. You can also internally share files or send them to external users. HighQ places a high priority on security, so you can always set permissions and limitations on who can access files, and how.

The tasks area offers a range of legal project management capabilities.



From here you can add tasks, review the details of current tasks, access documents related to a given task, change task priority simply by clicking and dragging, and much more.

Back on the main dashboard screen, when you access a particular matter (site), you get a new dashboard that you can customize with modules. This allows you to build and tailor a screen that shows you a range of data visualizations to better understand your project at glance.



You can also click into any given visualization to see an iSheet, which is essentially a combination database/spreadsheet that compiles all the information you need to track a matter.



There’s also a separate firmwide data dashboard that incorporates the social collaboration features of all users’ individual dashboard on a given matter and allows users to add items or visualizations for the whole firm to see.

Users with admin rights can access the project’s workflow engines and create rules for how the platform functions across a project, using if/then logic. There’s no coding or technical skill required – any user can easily manage how the platform functions, from how tasks trigger other actions to how iSheet edits cause documents to be created.

While you’re seeing all that, your clients see a different, more simplified dashboard, branded with your firm’s name.

Your clients have easy access to whatever content you want to share – essentially a one-stop-shop for your thought leadership and insights, where you can demonstrate your expertise. You can think of this as a way to commoditize the knowledge that previously just sat hidden in your files or in your head and make it available to your clients 24/7 in a useful environment that’s linked to what they’re working on.

Your clients can also communicate with you, feed you matter information and data, and submit legal service requests, as well as access work product and visualizations of the work being done on a project.



Simply put, there’s not much HighQ can’t do when it comes to collaboration between lawyers and clients, whether you’re at a law firm or a corporate legal department.

Try HighQ to solve your next big business problem, and you’ll soon find yourself using the platform to manage all your client engagements. HighQ currently works with approximately a million users at over 100,000 different organizations, including 75% of today’s Fortune 500 companies.

Lawyers are always looking for a better way to communicate and collaborate. HighQ is the answer. This is the only toolkit you need to solve even your most complex business problems and provide the best client service possible.

# Paternity-Leave Bias In Biglaw: When Will It End?
## Biglaw firms are slowly but surely recognizing that male attorneys need parental leave.

When it comes to parental leave in Biglaw, male lawyers often find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place. Men are already at a disadvantage when it comes to the amount of paid time off they’re due to receive for the birth or adoption of a child. While women in Biglaw receive about 15 weeks of paid maternity leave on average, at about 7 weeks on average, men in Biglaw receive less than half of the valuable time their female counterparts get to spend with the new additions to their families.

In addition to the shorter time allotted for paternity leave at most firms, men are often stigmatized for taking parental leave in the first place. Should they take the full amount of time off that’s offered by their firms (if any time off is offered in the first place) and perhaps risk putting their careers in jeopardy in the eyes of older partners, or should they quickly and quietly celebrate the birth or adoption of a child and power through their children’s formative months at the office?

Some firms are trying to do away with the stigma that men have to deal with when the topic of paternity leave is broached, and some progress has been made.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Winston & Strawn has been a leader in this revolution, offering a lengthy, [gender-neutral parental leave policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/biglaw-firm-makes-big-waves-with-gender-neutral-parental-leave-policy/) that doesn’t require attorneys to identify themselves as primary or secondary caregivers. At other firms, there’s been more of an effort made to support new fathers and encourage them to take off that they need to spend with their families. But in a professional environment where there’s an implicit bias against taking paternity leave, it’s essential that fathers in Biglaw do all that they possibly can to mainstream the practice.

Many male attorneys are too worried that their billable hours will suffer if they choose to take an extended amount of paternity leave time, even though some firms offer months of time off. One firm has offered a solution to that problem.

Taft Stettinius & Hollister, which just increased its leave to 16 weeks for both primary and secondary caregivers (up from 12 weeks for primary caregivers and two weeks for secondary caregivers), has changed its financial goals for lawyers who take parental leave. In an interview with [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/05/30/paternity-leave-stigma-at-law-firms-lifting-ever-so-slowly/) about the new policy, firm chairman and managing partner Bob Hicks said, “We treat the four months off as if they were working full time and give them credit as if they were. It would be a naked, ineffective policy if we didn’t change their billable hour goals and other goals for the leave.” Here are some additional details:

Hicks said he knows it will take time and a concerted effort to change his firm’s thinking about parental leave, and he expects the culture will change the most dramatically once nonprimary caregivers begin taking leave. The first lawyer recently announced he would take the full 16 weeks under the new policy.

Hicks has planned to make a “big deal” about the new policy at an upcoming employee retreat, he said. He also will caution older attorneys that if they talk about their experiences raising children without taking leave, younger attorneys might think they should not take time off.

“People don’t intend to be dismissive of our policy, but they talk about their days,” he said.

Both partners and associates will hear it from the top that lawyers will not face any stigma when they come back to work, he said.

# Law Firm Partner Rebuked Over Misconduct At Strip Club
## The regulators said 'seniority and intoxication were aggravating factors.'

Peter Walmsley, a former partner at international law firm Clyde & Co — 69th on the 2021 Global 200, was publicly rebuked by the U.K. regulatory body Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). Why you ask? Well, it dates back to a 2017 incident… at a strip club. As soon as you read that, you just know nothing good’s going to happen. Seriously, [the rebuke ](https://www.sra.org.uk/consumers/solicitor-check/267743/)says that “seniority and intoxication were aggravating factors,” and if that doesn’t just have the ring of truth to it.

Anyway, as [reported by](https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/05/sra-rebuke-for-former-city-partner-who-put-his-arm-around-trainee-in-strip-club/) Legal Cheek, Walmsley was at a client event with other attorneys including a female trainee, referred to as AB. As the evening wore on, the group looked for a “venue that offered late night drinking.” And it turned out they stumbled into a strip club. But rather than find another — seriously, any other — bar, the following occurred:

The bar turned out to have a sexual entertainment licence and was staffed by “women wearing underwear” who offered private dances in the back. The SRA decision states that “neither Mr Walmsley nor AB realised the nature of the Club until prior to entry”.

AB was uncomfortable but felt that she should stay for a little while so as not to embarrass the clients. This discomfort was “compounded” by Walmsley, then 44, putting his arm around her waist while the two were sitting together in a booth.

The SRA found that this was done “openly, and without any improper or sexual motivation” and that the partner was “unaware at the time of AB’s discomfort”.

But it concluded that his “failure to have sufficient regard” for AB’s well-being had “caused her to experience discomfort and distress”. Walmsley admitted that he should have acted differently and that the incident amounted to misconduct.

Walmsley agreed to the written rebuke.

According to reports, Clyde & Co fired Walmsley in October 2018 after inappropriate behavior complaints.

A spokesperson pointed to a statement issued at the time of his dismissal:
“Clyde & Co is committed to a working environment that is inclusive, professional and respectful. We hold ourselves to the highest standards of behaviour and expect all of our partners and staff to act with integrity, maintain high ethical standards and respect local and global regulatory environments at all times. We do not tolerate inappropriate behaviour.”

But Walmsley’s current firm, British insurance firm Horwich Farrelly, has a decidedly different take:

“This incident occurred over 5 years ago and Peter Walmsley now manages a very successful team at Horwich Farrelly. During his time here he has performed with impeccable conduct and with the full support of his team and clients who were made fully aware of the facts.

“Horwich Farrelly take issues of this nature very seriously and agree with the SRA findings that Peter should not have put himself or others in this position. The SRA have noted that there was absolutely no intent from Peter on the evening in question to attend a club of that nature, and there was no sexual or inappropriate motive or intent behind his actions.”

It continued: “Immediately after the event, and in the years since, Peter has shown that he has taken the matter extremely seriously and regrets the incident wholeheartedly. He has focused on his personal development to ensure he always puts the wellbeing of every team member first, in every situation. It is due to his constructive approach since the event that Horwich Farrelly believed he deserved the chance to further his career.”

But maybe someone else should be in charge of late night events, ya know?

# One Bar Admission To Rule Them All?
## How a proposed Rule 5.5 amendment could revolutionize your practice.

My family took a road trip last summer, and it went how road trips usually go. We left Phoenix driving eastward until we got to the border of New Mexico, where we picked up someone with a New Mexico driver’s license to sit in the passenger seat while I continued driving. We continued to the Texas border, where we swapped our passenger out for a Texas-licensed passenger to sit shotgun, and so on and so forth until we got to our destination.

It may seem burdensome, but hey, I’m only licensed to drive by the state of Arizona. Other states have their own traffic regulations that I can’t be expected to navigate safely without a local expert providing me guidance. It may be inconvenient and expensive to hire all those extra bodies, but it’s the only way to make sure the practice of driving safely and without injuring others.

Shut Up And Drive

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Thankfully, that’s not how driving works in this country. My driver’s license may have been issued under Arizona’s rules and regulations, but it’s a valid license in every state of the union. All those other states have their own individual variations on the rules of the road, but the basics of driving are similar enough everywhere that we permit people to figure out state nuances.

Licenses to practice law aren’t as all-purpose as a license to drive a vehicle. But if one major legal association gets its way, they’ll start looking a lot more similar.

After several years of research, discussion, and drafting, the Association of Professional Responsibility Lawyers (APRL) published an [open letter to the ABA](https://aprl.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Letter-regarding-our-proposal-to-ABA-President.pdf) late last month proposing significant changes to Model Rule 5.5, governing the unauthorized practice of law. If adopted, the new Rule 5.5 would permit a lawyer admitted anywhere in the United States to provide legal services in any jurisdiction that has adopted the new rule, without regard to physical presence, state licensure, or any other geographic factor. One of the longest-lived protective guardrails in the history of American law would be largely dismantled.

Now before your lawyer instincts kick in and you start trying to shoot holes in the proposal, it might be worth taking time to consider the basis for APRL’s recommendation.

Break The Walls Down

The current ABA Model Rules are rooted in many 20th-century assumptions that don’t hold true anymore. The first rules and statutes prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law (UPL) were adopted a century ago and have been tweaked along the way, most recently in 2002 for Rule 5.5.

The practice of law looks drastically different today than it did even a decade ago — particularly after the forced modernization of our industry caused by COVID-19. Remote practice has gone from novel luxury to total normalcy. A Nebraska-licensed attorney vacationing in Hawaii might have a Zoom call with a client living in Maryland who works for a company based in Michigan to consult on an issue at an Ohio job site. That’s 21st-century legal practice. Clients and attorneys shouldn’t have to spend half an hour of their Zoom call to figure out if the attorney is allowed to provide advice on the topic.

The original rules against UPL had two practical purposes: protecting the public from bad lawyering and protecting lawyers from out-of-state competition. For as labyrinthine as the law has grown in the past century, I’d argue that it’s the easiest it’s ever been for a lawyer to develop the competence necessary to represent a client ethically and effectively. We don’t need to head down to musty law libraries to browse KeyCite digests and mimeograph statutes anymore. With Westlaw, Lexis, Fastcase, and the many research platforms available, all the tools for a deep understanding of the nuances of an individual state’s corpus of law are a few keystrokes and hours of study away.

The law is also in many ways more uniform across states than it’s ever been. The Restatements have been deeply influential across the country, and many states have adopted myriad [Uniform Statutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_uniform_acts_(United_States)). Learning another state’s take on at topic is more often about learning variations on themes than it is understanding an entire separate framework. Substantive differences in law are fewer, and procedural differences are less harrowing than they’ve ever been.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Importantly, adopting the proposed Rule 5.5 wouldn’t mean the legal market becomes a complete free-for-all. The basic rules of competency and diligence remain in place regardless of where you are or where you practice. Lawyers would need to affirmatively disclose where they’re admitted to the bar, and thus by implication disclose if they’re not admitted in the state they’re seeking to practice. And don’t throw away your pro hac vice application forms just yet because the courts would also retain dominion over who they permit to appear before them. You might still be picking up that local passenger to ride shotgun with you as your litigation practice crosses state lines. And let’s not forget that, if you do make a state-specific mistake, clients retain the right to sue you for malpractice — a fact that offers opportunity for redress and deters lawyers from totally whiffing it.

The Genie Doesn’t Go Back Into The Bottle

Let’s face it, this collapsing of borders is already happening. Consider the Uniform Bar Examination, which is currently adopted in 37 states. The law we have to study to actually get admitted to any individual jurisdiction is increasingly the same. What’s more, many states have, for years, allowed established attorneys the ability to waive into other state bars on motion alone, without taking the bar exam again. And this model isn’t without precedent. CPAs take a single national exam for their certification that’s been administered for over 100 years, and APRL specifically cited the national driver’s license model in their arguments supporting the new proposed Rule 5.5.

If protecting the public from bad lawyering is no longer a strong rationale for our existing UPL framework, the only justification we’re left with is protecting attorneys from competition. Given the access to justice problems we’re already trying to deal with, this seems to be prioritizing lawyers’ interests ahead of those of the public. Wealthy clients want the best counsel for their needs, no matter where that counsel happens to live and practice. Working-class clients just want an attorney they can afford to see them through the biggest challenges in their life. In both instances, expanding the pool of attorneys is a positive.

Every step our industry takes toward the modern world is a step in the right direction. The proposal makes sense conceptually and from a business standpoint. Reducing artificial barriers to practicing law may invite competition to come into our home states, but it also allows each of us to go out and offer our services to compete on a national scale. For the sake of our clients, and the sake of ourselves, let’s move forward and stop pretending the world ends at the state line.

* Will law school graduates be the next ones to have their student loans canceled? Thanks to the Department of Education’s proposal of an expanded debt forgiveness rule last week, law school graduates may be able to qualify for a “defense to repayment” provision — and escape their debt — if they can prove they were defrauded. [[BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/law-school-grads-could-be-next-to-have-student-loans-cancell?utm_term=.xkwNd10Q0#.ruGEMzl6l)]

* “I’m just not taking any chances with my legal profession. It’s very difficult to qualify as a solicitor and I’m not willing to just give it up because the U.K. decides to vote out the EU.” British attorneys specializing in antitrust law are registering as Irish solicitors for fear of losing their ability to practice EU law. Thanks, Brexit. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/brexit-leads-u-k-lawyers-to-seek-solace-in-irish-bar/)]

* Blank Rome is adding Stacy Phillips’s celebrity divorce boutique to its firm. Over the course of her career, Phillips has represented many “high-net-worth, high-end clients,” the likes of which include Britney Spears and Bobby Brown. With the addition of her small firm, Blank Rome’s family-law group will grow to 30 attorneys.

# Extraditing Tradition
## When tradition is prioritized over innovation, progress will always take a back seat to aesthetics.

There is a saying among lawyers — well, less of a saying and more of a parody of a cliché expression. We say that you should judge a book by its case, not its cover. Not the best joke, sure, especially when you hear it for the hundredth time, but, to quote another cliché, “many a true word is spoken in jest.” The parody points out that something’s substance should always outweigh its appearance. Unfortunately, many people do not subscribe to this famous maxim.

A friend of mine was leaving Biglaw to strike out on her own, which was, as expected, a tumultuous time for her, leading to her seeking solid advice from industry experts. She got a huge amount of input, which inevitably meant that she would need to take a few things with a grain of salt. For me, though, one particular comment necessitated a whole bag of salt — not to preserve it, but to get rid of the smell. Like a hamburger in the back of a fridge, it was both old and off.

The advice?

Get a mahogany desk, leather-bound books, and expensive suits.

Now, I don’t think any of those things are inherently bad (in fact, the aesthetic fits some people quite well). My problem resided in the fact that people told her she would need those things in order to be successful, which I could not possibly disagree with more.

There is a popular notion that, if you engage in the field of law, then your lifestyle and environment must look like they came straight out of an episode of Suits!

This is fundamentally flawed.

The aesthetic originated as a by-product of good lawyers — those who did well enough to afford high-quality furnishing and attire proved influential in multiple ways. But now, for a lot of lawyers, the aesthetic comes before being a good lawyer! People assume that having that look would then automatically make you a great lawyer.

Not only is this a preposterous suggestion, at the end of the day, it also doesn’t make much sense for a new practice to splurge on expensive furnishings. Their capital is invaluable and should be spent on things that directly benefit process or profit (technology, an assistant’s salary, marketing, you get the idea). There is a long list of things that would benefit my friend far more than having the “lawyer look.”

When tradition is prioritized over innovation, progress will always take a back seat to aesthetics. I firmly believe that it is time to remove tradition from the law industry equation. As long as someone operates under the jurisdiction of the old order, nothing will change. As we take law to new places, creating more “[law fusions](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/the-law-fusion-paradigm/),” we need to convict tradition on its encroachment upon freedom and take back the liberty that was always ours.

The best measure of your career is not your three-piece suit, but the value you add to your clients, which looks great on them. Time is never lost when value is added. Focus on what you bring to the table. Don’t worry about what said table looks like. Show up as yourself every time, because you will never regret being you.

You could build a successful career with just a clean white desk, sophisticated technology, and impasto paintings. You don’t need leather-bound pages. You don’t even need paper!

# Another Biglaw Firm Resorts To Bonus Threats To Get Attorneys Back To The Office
## Want your money? Get to the office.

Biglaw would really like associates to [come back to the office](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/biglaw-leaders-still-worried-about-getting-associates-back-to-the-office/). Whether it’s because of lease obligations, training woes, trying to build a culture, or all of the above, by and large, firms would love to have attorneys back in the office. The question is how to do it.

We’ve seen some [carrot approaches](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/can-biglaw-associates-be-lured-back-to-the-office-with-new-food-options/), but increasingly [mandates](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/cravath-backtracks-on-the-flexible-part-of-its-flexible-office-policy/) are the default. And for associates that don’t get on board with the rules of the road? They can expect to have their [bonuses docked](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/want-your-full-biglaw-bonus-better-get-back-to-the-office/). Now another firm is joining the ranks of [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/associates-hit-with-unannounced-bonus-reductions-for-not-being-in-the-office-enough/), [Sidley](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/sidley-associates-bonus-office-in-person-covid-policy/), and [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/davis-polk-associates-bonus-office-attendance/) and explicitly tying office attendance to associate bonuses.

Cahill recently sent a new office attendance policy to all lawyers at the firm. There was previously no formal office attendance policy, but now associates had best get their butts to the office 3x a week if they want their full bonus. The announcement does tip its hat to the notion that flexibility is important for attorneys, but folks must “substantially comply” with the new policy.

Now that this trend has taken off, will other Biglaw firms follow? If your firm is linking bonuses to office attendance let us know. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Attendance) or text us (646-820-8477). Thanks for your help.

The firm’s announcement is below.

# Biglaw Heavyweight Makes Its Mark On New Associate Compensation
## Woohoo! The firm announced a new salary scale much quicker than it did last time.

Another firm bites the dust. As every hour (or 15 to 30 minutes, by our count) ticks by, another firm decides to match the new salary scale. The latest firm to do so is WilmerHale, which came in at No. 29 in the most recent Am Law 100.

To think, the last time salary raises spread through the Biglaw landscape, associates were worried about the firm’s radio silence. Now, the firm has matched less than a day after Cravath gave the new salary scale its seal of approval. Imagine that!

# Davis Polk To Deactivate Building ID Cards Of Unvaccinated Lawyers And Staff
## The compensation leader is using a strict 'vax or GTFO' method when it comes to its vaccine policy.

Want to go back to the office? If you’re an employee at Davis Polk, that means you’d better be fully vaccinated — as soon as possible — because without proof, you will not be welcomed back to the firm. In fact, you won’t even be able to get inside the building because your access pass will be deactivated.

It turns out Davis Polk isn’t just a leader when it comes to compensation, but the firm is also a leader when it comes to the [ramifications of going unvaccinated](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/02/the-unvaccinated-at-davis-polk-face-deactivated-building-passes-come-september/) during the pandemic.

Many firms that have added vaccination protocol to their reopening plans have stated that the unvaccinated will not be allowed through their doors, but Davis Polk is the first firm we know of to put those words into action. If employees do not complete a vaccination attestation — which will include the type of vaccine received, dates of vaccination, and the vaccine lot number — by 11:59 p.m. on September 12, 2021, their Davis Polk ID cards will be deactivated and they will not be allowed to enter the building.

Davis Polk is still planning to reopen on September 13, and in a memo to all employees sent earlier today, managing partner Neil Barr said that while medical or religious vaccine exception requests would be reviewed, there is “no guarantee that a request will be granted.” Excluding a medical or religious reason, “no exceptions to the vaccination policy will be permitted.”

“We continue to monitor developments related to the Delta variant. We will apprise you of any changes in our return to office policy as circumstances dictate. For now, U.S. office personnel should plan to be present in the office during the week of September 13,” Barr’s memo said, adding, “I hope that this COVID-19 vaccination policy provides an additional layer of assurance to you and your families.”

With it’s strict vaccination policy, Davis Polk is making great efforts to protect its employees during these unprecedented times.

Will your firm be changing its plans when it comes to vaccination for attorneys and staff thanks to the Delta variant? Please let us know. The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

# The United States Court Of International Trade Declares The Importation Of Cannabis Paraphernalia Legal
## This case is a major win for the cannabis industry.

Although importing drug paraphernalia is illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act ([CSA](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title21/chapter13&edition=prelim)), the United States Court of International Trade ([CIT](https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/)) recently held that cannabis paraphernalia could be lawfully imported into Washington state pursuant to a statutory exemption never before recognized by a federal court.

The CIT reached this decision when analyzing a [case](https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/22-111.pdf) in which Customs and Border Protection (CBP) excluded from entry at the Port of Blaine, Washington, cannabis-trimming equipment on the grounds that the goods constituted drug paraphernalia prohibited under the CSA.

In assessing the interplay between federal and state laws governing cannabis-related drug paraphernalia, the CIT concluded that the equipment could lawfully enter the state because Washington law expressly authorizes the possession, distribution, and manufacture of marijuana-related drug paraphernalia, thereby triggering the federal authorization exemption at 863(f)(1).

Below is a summary of the main factors considered by the CIT in assessing this dispute, which presented a matter of first impression.

Legal Background

- Federal Prohibition On Drug Paraphernalia
Pursuant to [21 U.S.C. § 863(a)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap13-subchapI-partD-sec863.pdf), it is “unlawful for any person (1) to sell or offer for sale drug paraphernalia; (2) to use the mails or any other facility of interstate commerce to transport drug paraphernalia; or (3) to import or export drug paraphernalia.” (Emphasis added.)

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Drug paraphernalia” is broadly defined as “any equipment, product, or material of any kind which is primarily intended or designed for use in manufacturing, compounding, converting, concealing, producing, processing, preparing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance.” 21 U.S.C. § 863(d) — When determining whether an item falls under this definition, federal agents consider eight factors listed under 21 U.S.C. § 863(e).

Therefore, as a federal agency in charge of enforcing federal importation and exportation laws and regulations, CBP is tasked with prohibiting entry and seizing drug paraphernalia.

However, 21 U.S.C. § 863(f) contains two exemptions to this prohibition, one of which applies to “a person [ ] authorized by local, State, or Federal law to manufacture, possess, or distribute such items[.]” (Emphasis added.)

- Washington State Exemption To Federal Prohibition
In 2012, the state of Washington legalized the adult recreational use of marijuana and amended its prohibition on drug paraphernalia to expressly exclude marijuana from the definition of “drug paraphernalia.” See [Initiative 502](https://www.mpp.org/states/washington/washingtons-i-502/) to the Legislature, 2013 Wash. Sess. Laws ch. 3 (codified as amended at [RCW 69.50.101-710](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=69.50)).

Factual Background

Eteros Technologies USA, Inc. (Eteros) attempted to import parts of the “Mobius M108S Trimmer,” equipment designed to separate the leaf from the flower of cannabis and/or other plant material, through the port of Blaine, Washington.

Upon its arrival at the port of entry, the equipment was seized by CBP as the federal agency questioned its intended use and whether the subject merchandise would “be used at any point, in any way, to manufacture, produce, or process a product that has a [THC] concentration over 0.3 percent.” — In other words, CBP questioned whether the equipment met the definition of “drug paraphernalia” under the CSA; and thereby, whether it contravened the import prohibition.

In its response to CBP’s Request for Information, Eteros explained that the equipment did not qualify as “drug paraphernalia” because the primary intended use of the Mobius M108S Trimmer was with hemp, not marijuana, and even if the Mobius M108S Trimmer qualified as “drug paraphernalia” under § 863(d), the exemption established in § 863(f)(1) rendered § 863(a)(3)’s import prohibition inapplicable in light of the state of Washington’s legalization of marijuana and marijuana-related paraphernalia.

CBP rejected Eteros’s argument, so, in response, Eteros initiated this lawsuit.

The Court’s Reasoning

The CIT’s analysis focused on whether the state of Washington’s repeal of certain prohibitions regarding marijuana-related drug paraphernalia “authorized” the importation of the Mobius M108S Trimmer.

Specifically, the court closely analyzed the CSA and Washington state’s equivalent, but also considered and applied [Murphy v. NCAA](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-476_dbfi.pdf), a Supreme Court case where the highest court held that New Jersey’s sport-betting law “authorized” sport gambling and held that a state’s repeal of a prior prohibition constitutes an “authorization” of that previously prohibited conduct, and concluded that Washington law authorized the importation of Eteros’s trimmer and deemed CBP’s seizure unjustified.

Implications

This case is a major win for the cannabis industry — thanks to [Richard O’Neill](https://www.npllptradelaw.com/richard-f-oneill) from [Neville Peterson LLP](https://www.npllptradelaw.com/), who brilliantly argued this case — in that it suggests that the importation of cannabis paraphernalia is allowed so long as its entry occurs in a state where cannabis is lawful and exempt from the state’s CSA.

If unchallenged by the U.S. government (which seems unlikely), this case would set a national precedent that would open up the importation (and likely the exportation) of currently federally prohibited drug paraphernalia. This is an exciting prospect for cannabis stakeholders, who for too long now have been faced with unfair and onerous challenges in importing cannabis paraphernalia.

# 9 Fundamentals For A New In-House Litigator (Or, Outside Litigators’ Blind Spots)
## What does a litigator need to know when she moves from a law firm to an in-house position?

I’ve recently had to think about what a new in-house litigator should know.

Presumably, a new in-house litigator knows a lot about litigation. The person’s been litigating for 10, or 20, or 25 years. I don’t have to explain the meaning of “discovery” or the limits on federal jurisdiction.

But what does a new in-house litigator have to know that he wouldn’t have ordinarily learned at a law firm?

He wouldn’t have learned the first rule of in-house life: If information goes to someone above me in the hierarchy, it goes to me, too.

[I’ve written about this before.](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/if-it-goes-to-people-above-me-then-it-goes-to-me-too/) The person to whom I report may assume that I know everything she knows. So make that true. If you’re going to speak to my boss, or to someone above my boss in the hierarchy, speak to me, too. No secrets.

Second: If a prosecutor, or a government regulator, or a whistle-blower calls, it’s time to set the sirens blazing and red lights flashing. Do not wait a couple of weeks to report events like this.

Third: We are legally obligated to take a reserve under GAAP if it’s more than 70 percent likely that we’ll lose a case, and we’re legally required to take a reserve under IFRS if it’s more than 50 percent likely we’ll lose a case. (My company is subject to both U.S. and U.K. accounting rules, so we track both sets of numbers.) Those are not optional requirements.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And we can’t slowly increase reserves to build up enough money to settle a case: “We’ll take a million this quarter, and a million next. In a year or so, we’ll have plenty saved up to pay the settlement.” That might naturally seem like a good idea, but it’s illegal. It’s also something that lawyers at firms don’t think about.

If we don’t know the exact amount that we’ll lose, we might nonetheless be able to calculate a range of loss — it’s 71 (or 51) percent likely that we’ll lose between one and two million dollars. Under GAAP, you set the reserve at the low end of a range; under IFRS, you set the reserve at the midpoint of the range.

Fourth: We have a concept known as “settlement approval authority.” Every proposed settlement must be approved at the right level in the Law Department. Those beneath you in the hierarchy have approval authority up to $A. You have authority up to $B. I have authority up to $C. We need the CEO’s approval for settlements above $D. If we need the CEO’s approval, we will have to prepare a very short, very cogent explanation, written in language that a non-lawyer can understand, of why we need that much money to settle the case.

Fifth: We have a quarterly litigation budget: We are budgeted to spend $X million per quarter (net of insurance receivables) defending lawsuits and settling claims. Although our bonuses aren’t affected by whether we make budget (because it’s not really the litigators’ fault if the company is sued, or is sued in a tough case), we should strive to make that budget every quarter.

Sixth: The deductible under our insurance policy is $Y. If you’re trying to make budget net of insurance receivables, you really have to know at what point insurance receivables kick in. (The limits of your insurance — at the top end — are relevant, but far less so, unless the company might really get hammered in a case. And, needless to say, you shouldn’t give away money simply because a case is insured, for assorted reasons. But the deductibles under each relevant policy matter.)

Seventh: At the level of $Z million, notify the folks in Treasury that we might have cash going out the door. The Treasury department manages cash flow, and at some level — $500K, $1MM, $10MM, depending on the size of your company — Treasury won’t be able to pay a settlement that you’ve agreed to. If you see a large payment coming, give the Treasury department as much advance notice as you can.

Eighth: Our business has unique things to consider when resolving claims. I really can’t say much about this, because these factors vary by business. But pharmaceutical companies fighting mass tort litigants, for example, don’t have much leverage. Pharmaceutical companies fighting with physicians or providers of medical benefits might be situated quite differently; the pharmaceutical company might have significant leverage. Tell the in-house litigator what he (or she) should know that is unique to your company and that the person wouldn’t necessarily have learned at a firm.

Ninth: Schedule one-on-one meetings with the people who report to you. No one knows about this at law firms; it’s a way of life at corporations.

I’m sure I’ve missed some of the basics. Please tell me about them by sending an email to the address below.

As for what I’m saying publicly, that’s it. If I’ve omitted anything, I guess your new litigator will have to learn by trial (so to speak) and error.

# Another Biglaw Firm Steps Up With Six-Figure Clerkship Bonuses
## Another Biglaw firm really wants to compete for attorneys with federal clerkships.

With Biglaw bonus news sweeping the industry, it is easy for those on the outside of Biglaw looking in to feel left out. But there’s good news for folks working at federal clerkships — there’s a bunch of money waiting for you (should you decide to go to Biglaw).

Federal clerkships are incredibly prestigious, and many high-end law firms really want people with that experience to work for them. That’s why the high end of bonuses for federal clerks who decide to join law firms post-clerkship reaches six figures. Now another firm has hit that threshold. Munger Tolles & Olson — a firm with $283,320,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 116th on the Am Law 100 — is paying a bonus of $80,000 for a single federal clerkship, and $105,000 for those with two federal clerkships under their belt.

While impressive, it’s not the very top of clerkship bonuses — [that honor goes to](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/boutique-law-firm-dovel-luner-wows-with-mega-clerkship-bonuses-that-beat-the-market/?rf=1) California plaintiffs firm Dovel & Luner who offer a jaw-dropping $140,000 as a clerkship bonus. And Quinn Emanuel has a [clerkship bonus of $105,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/which-biglaw-firm-is-now-offering-105k-clerkship-bonuses/) and folks with only a single year of clerkship experience are eligible for that bonus, with an addition $20,000 if the applicant completes a second qualifying clerkship. Litigation [boutique Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/another-firm-is-ponying-up-105k-in-clerkship-bonuses/) also offers $105,000 bonuses to former federal clerks. Robins Kaplan[ offers $100,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/another-elite-firm-wows-with-six-figure-clerkship-bonuses/?rf=1) bonuses to former federal clerks. Fish & Richardson made headlines with an [impressive number to former clerks](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/april-brings-showers-of-115k-bonuses-for-federal-clerks/) ($115,000), but that only applies to folks with Federal Circuit experience and it requires two years of service as a clerk.

Despite this good news, most Biglaw clerkship bonuses are still only around $50,000. So what are the other firms waiting for?

# NALP 2016: Nobody Really Likes The New OCI, But Nobody Can Change It

Nobody would choose to hire new talent the way Biglaw firms do it if they had any choice in the matter. Hiring lawyers in the summer before their 2L year, based on only one year’s worth of grades, two years before you actually need them to show up to work… is dumb. Everybody knows it’s dumb. During the recession — when law firms tried to on-board huge classes of new associates for which they had no work — most people imagined that the on-campus interviewing process (OCI) would get a major overhaul in the coming years.

It did. It got worse for firms.

The problem, as pretty much always, starts with law schools. During OCI in 2009, firms were still adjusting to the “new normal.” Remember, this was right after the disastrous Summer of 2009, when firms killed offer rates for their own summers, effectively ruining the kids who didn’t get a job at their 2L firm and were thrown into a 3L hiring market that simply did not exist. By the time OCI rolled around that fall, firms knew they had to drastically cut the size of their summer programs, but were unprepared for the much higher yield rate of desperate students taking the first offer extended. That meant that in 2009, law schools who interviewed near the end of the process lost out on spots for their students that were snapped up by students from schools earlier in Fall recruiting.

It was a market correction, terrible but temporary. Firms would adjust and by 2010, greatly reduced summer classes were getting the normal 90% offer rate. But shortsighted law schools shouted “NEVER AGAIN” and moved up their interview weeks earlier in the calendar. That caused early schools to push up even earlier and now… what used to be “fall recruiting” (in ’02, I had OCI in late September and callbacks during the World Series), is now truncated into about four weeks in July and August.

Which, again, is dumb. It’s dumb for the schools which end up forcing their students into making quicker decisions about this life-altering choice. It’s dumb for firms whose relatively small recruiting teams are stretched to the max.

The first panel I attended at National Association for Law Placement’s (NALP) 2016 Annual Education Conference was called “Drinking From The Fire Hose: August Interview Trends.” Just think about that name. What is OCI like for firms now? It’s like getting drenched by a gigantic phallic apparatus when all you asked for was a glass of water.

On the panel were Paul Giangola and Caitlin Obringer, recruiting directors at Dechert and HoLove respectively. And Rob Cacace, the professional development guy at Georgetown Law.

Giangola said that Dechert will travel to 42 different schools between July 25th and August 23rd. He said it with the same faraway look Bilbo Baggins has when he talks about butter being spread over too much bread.

The panel focused on strategies for managing the sheer numbers of applicants coming through the firm in a short period of time. Apparently, a lot of you are enjoying “group callback days,” where they bring a bunch of you into the firm and interview you “round robin” style. Giangola’s personal favorite is the “callback night,” where after your interview, you hit up a firm cocktail reception. Thank God they didn’t have these when my alcoholic ass was trying to hang on just long enough to get a job.

The main takeaway was that firms are encouraged to get their offers out to people as early as possible. It’s not that students will necessarily take those offers early. It’s just that with such a short time to schedule things, if your offer isn’t on the table the student might just be too booked with callbacks to fit your firm in.

Yeah, I said “too booked with callbacks.” The only people who are making out like bandits with the current system are the people who did well under the old system: the top students that everybody wants to hire anyway. These special snowflakes have always been fawned over, but Millennials are taking it to another level. Some examples:

• It’s now common for the top kids to ask for “second visits.” Like a whole other day where they come back to the firm, meet specific people, and generally get more of a feel for the place.
• Instead of telling people “thanks, but I’ve decided to go somewhere else,” the kids will just Ghost on a firm that they are no longer interested in.
• Recruiters are encouraged to be able to talk intelligently about “exit options” from their firms. Let me say that again… Millennials are straight up asking “what do people do when they get out of here,” and you, the hiring person, better have a good answer.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I can’t imagine interviewing for a job and talking about what job I’d like to have after I quit that job, but I’m old and I guess I just don’t understand why those kids have to ride their skateboards all over the place.

The other big trend is that more and more firms are trying to “cut the line” of OCI and are extending offers to people before on-campus interviewing even begins. The panel suggested that while firms are doing this because they think it gives them an advantage, there’s little evidence to suggest that it does. Kids who get “Pre-OCI” offers still go through regular OCI, and they still make their decisions at the same time everybody else does. If anything, kids are using the Pre-OCI offers to leverage even quicker offer decisions from the firms they really want to go to. The panel was sly here, warning firms to “know where they stack up.” That’s, like, NALP code for “don’t try to pull this s**t unless you are Cravath or similar.” The top students know they are the top students and will not go to a lesser firm just because a firm yells “FIRST.”

In fact, the panelists suggested that the main use of Pre-OCI offers is for those students to brag and freak out their friends who didn’t get them. So… law students, if you hear someone talking about how they already have offers before OCI even starts, your instincts are correct, that person is a jerky jerkface and should be ostracized from polite society.

It seems that everybody has a strategy for dealing with the new OCI, but nobody has a plan to fix it. We have a system designed around hiring the 4.0 law review editor at a T14, when most students are not that student and most firms have no chance of attracting that student. We have a schedule that is condensed because of conditions which no longer exist. And we even have firms trying to trick the top talent they so desire into accepting an offer before they see all of their options.

Who wants it this way? When I see people lined up behind a fire truck waiting to get their faces blasted off by the hose, I don’t see victims. I see volunteers.

# Biglaw Firm Raided By Authorities For Second Time In Connection With Financial Scandal
## The practice is estimated to have cost taxpayers there €12 billion ($13.7 billion).

There’s a tax scandal afoot in Germany, and the Frankfort office of Biglaw giant Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer seems to be caught up in the mess. Freshfields is being looked at for their tax work for the Canadian Maple Bank, which operated a German subsidiary until 2016 when it declared insolvency. According to [reporting by](https://global.handelsblatt.com/finance/police-raid-freshfields-law-firm-cum-ex-frankfurt-983504) German paper Handelsblatt Global, prosecutors are targeting two partners and a tax specialist with their investigation, though they declined to name the individuals.

The issue surrounds the accounting of “cum-ex” transactions, also known as dividend stripping, which German authorities believe were used by multiple banks to claim more than one refund on taxes that were only paid once. German law was amended in 2012 to end the practice, but it is estimated to have cost taxpayers there €12 billion ($13.7 billion).

Last week, the German authorities conducted their second raid on the Biglaw firm in connection with the dividend-stripping investigation. The first was done in October of 2017, and the second raid could spell trouble for the firm:

A lawyer familiar with the Maple Bank case told Handelsblatt that the second raid suggests prosecutors have new prima facie evidence. Raids on major law firms are extremely rare, he said, and this one indicated that prosecutors had lost faith in Freshfields’ position.

A spokesperson for Freshfields made a statement touting the legality of their tax advice:

“We remain convinced that our advice was legally sound. It was always in keeping with the current state of the law. We look forward to any court case with complete confidence.”

Though the specific raid was in connection with Freshfields’s representation of Maple Bank, a number of the firm’s bank clients, including Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, Dekabank, Barclays, and Macquarie, are also caught in the scandal.

# Malpractice Suit Takes Aim At 2 Biglaw Firms
## The complaint alleges two firms screwed the pooch in drafting a contract.

Not one, but two different Biglaw firms are facing a malpractice suit alleging that they failed to properly advise their mutual client. Perkins Coie and Bracewell were attorneys for Electron Trading LLC in the negotiations of a technology licensing agreement with Morgan Stanley. And according to Electron Trading, things didn’t go as planned.

Electron Trading wanted to license its technology for spread trading — which allows investors to simultaneously buy and sell securities in an effort to capture price difference between financial instruments — to Morgan Stanley. Electron alleges two key parts of the proposed deal were limiting Electron’s liability for third-party intellectual property claims and maintaining their right to sue Morgan Stanley in the event of a contract breach. Unfortunately, neither of those terms were in the agreement they actually signed.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2018/05/07/perkins-coie-bracewell-targeted-in-malpractice-suit-over-ip-licensing-deal/) Law.com, the complaint alleges Morgan Stanley lawyers added provisions to the agreement that were… the exact opposite:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The license agreement was drafted with language that accomplished the opposite result: Electron’s potential liability to indemnify Morgan Stanley against third party claims was unlimited while Morgan Stanley’s liability to Electron for willfully breaching the license agreement was capped at the amount it had already paid Electron.

Electron says that the firms’ failure to inform them of these… incredibly relevant changes was a dereliction of their duties.

As one might imagine given these favorable terms, Morgan Stanley allegedly breached the contract soon after it was executed. And Electron struck out when they tried to take Morgan Stanley to court:

“Electron was left negotiating against one of the most sophisticated financial entities in the world without receiving the basic and necessary legal advice that any reasonable and competent lawyer would have provided,” the malpractice suit said. Electron also alleged that, in light of the shoddy contract drafting, the two law firms caused the company damages that include lost royalties under the licensing pact and the costs of unsuccessfully litigating against Morgan Stanley.

Biglaw associates, were you hoping that another firm would swoop in and offer more year-end bonus money, forcing other firms that have already matched to up the ante? Keep hoping, because it looks like that extra money won’t be coming from Sullivan & Cromwell this year.

The top 20 Am Law firm already decided to [match the Davis Polk special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/sullivan-cromwell-makes-a-move-in-covid-19-bonus-war/) earlier this fall when other firms of its prestige were unwilling to do so, and now, the firm’s black bonus box has been smashed open, and it looks like the firm is offering associates a straight [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) match.

The 2020 year-end bonus scale at SullCrom likely looks like this:

# Furloughs Turn Into Layoffs At Yet Another Am Law 100 Firm
## And some attorneys still remain furloughed.

In the past few days, Above the Law has reported on a number of firms that have been conducting layoffs and announcing those layoffs at the same time as their COVID-19 salary restorations. We’ve just learned that Nixon Peabody — a firm that placed 75th in the most recent Am Law 100, bringing in $505,520,000 in gross revenue in 2019 — is one of those firms.

As we reported in April, Nixon Peabody [furloughed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/massive-furloughs-hit-this-biglaw-firm/) about 25 percent of its staff members, and later that same month, the firm [cut 10 percent of its non-partner attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-announces-attorney-layoffs-and-furloughs/) (divided by approximately 5 percent layoffs and 5 percent furloughs). In May, the firm came for [employees’ salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/more-nixon-peabody-cost-cutting-measures-this-time-associate-salaries-are-on-the-chopping-block/) and deferred its incoming associate class. Now, sources tell us that some of those whose salaries were reduced had had them restored, and further that while some of those furloughed have returned to the firm, others have been laid off.

Here’s an excerpt from a confidential Nixon Peabody memo sent sometime last month (available in full on the next page) regarding staff salaries:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
When we went remote abruptly in March, we took steps to ensure that we could navigate the uncertainty of the pandemic. One of the decisions we made in May, that took effect in June, was to temporarily reduce all NP staff schedules and salaries to 80%.

Now that we are a few months into this schedule change, people are getting busier. As a result, we have made the decision to restore many staff members to a 100% schedule and base compensation effective August 31.

In the same memo, Nixon Peabody discussed furloughed staff, noting that while some will return to work at the end of September, others never will. As far as attorneys are concerned, many have been brought back, but some are still waiting for word on when their careers will resume. Take a look:

Today, we will reach out to all of our furloughed staff colleagues to provide an update to each of them. Some will be notified that their position has been restored and that the current plan is for them to return to active work with NP on September 28th. Others will be informed that their position has been eliminated and their employment with NP will be ending. HR directors will be reaching out to these colleagues today. …

Our furloughed attorneys are not part of the communications occurring today. Over the past several months, we have brought back a number of our furloughed attorney colleagues. We still have a few who are currently furloughed. We are in the process of evaluating our business needs to determine who we may be able to bring back to NP, and the potential timing for any returns.

At this time, we do not believe any movement has been made in terms of restoration of associate salaries. We reached out to Nixon Peabody for comment, but the firm did not immediately respond.

# Bye-Bye To Blue Slips
## The demise of blue slips is good news for the federal judiciary -- and the American people.

A blue slip (Senate Judiciary Committee via Alliance for Justice).

Last week witnessed a noteworthy passing. Blue slips, rest in peace.

Blue slips have been part of the federal judicial nominations process for more than a century, but the importance they deserve in that process has been the subject of vigorous debate. Here’s some background on blue slips from a [New York Times op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/opinion/senate-judicial-nominees-blue-slips.html) I wrote about them last week:

On Wednesday morning, the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a confirmation hearing for Ryan Bounds, a federal prosecutor who has been nominated to the influential United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. The hearing is taking place despite the refusal of his home-state Democratic senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, to return their “blue slips” — blue pieces of paper that senators use to indicate their favorable or unfavorable opinion of a nominee from their state. [Ed. note: As I’ve mentioned before in these pages, and I mention elsewhere in the Times piece, Bounds is a friend of mine from law school.]

Blue slips are not provided for in the Constitution or by statute; they are merely a Senate tradition, and the importance given to them has varied over the years. But this latest shift in blue-slip practice has generated loud opposition, especially from the left, because in recent history — and during the [entire Obama administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/opinion/senate-blue-slips-republicans.html) — no hearing or vote was held on a nominee unless both home-state senators had returned their blue slips.

The Bounds hearing wasn’t the only bad news for blue slips from last week. Last Thursday, the Senate confirmed Michael Brennan to the Seventh Circuit by a vote of 49-46, even though one of his home-state senators, Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), refused to return her blue slip.

Although not the focus of my op-ed, the historical variation in treatment of blue slips merits notice. As noted in this [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/02/21/are-senate-republicans-killing-blue-slip-for-court-nominees/?utm_term=.b88e88cdb940) piece, it’s incorrect of Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and other Democrats to claim that Republicans are destroying a “century-old tradition” of giving a single senator, through the blue slip, effective veto power over nominees from her home state. For a majority of the 100 or so years that blue slips have been around, including periods when the Senate Judiciary Committee was led by Democrats like Joe Biden and Ted Kennedy, blue slips have not been given this kind of power and importance.

And it’s a good thing too, as I argue in the Times:

Many people have bemoaned the demise of the filibuster and now the blue slip. It certainly reflects a decline in senatorial courtesy. It’s bad news for individual senators, who now have less power to scuttle nominations.

But the effect that scrapping blue slips will have upon the federal judiciary, and therefore the nation, is actually positive.

The federal bench has a high number of vacancies. In January 2017, the start of President Trump’s term, there were [106](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/archive-judicial-vacancies/2017/01/summary) vacancies in the life-tenured federal judiciary. Today there are 174 [current](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/current-judicial-vacancies) and [known future](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/future-judicial-vacancies) vacancies, although 33 of Mr. Trump’s judicial nominees have been confirmed. Of these vacancies, 72 have been declared [judicial emergencies](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/judicial-emergencies) by the Judicial Conference, based on how long they have been open and the heavy caseloads in their courts.

Vacancies are a serious problem. Imagine any institution — a sports team, a legislature, a university faculty — trying to operate with almost 20 percent of its members missing. According to the [Federal Bar Association](http://www.fedbar.org/Advocacy/Judicial-Vacancies/Fact-Sheet.aspx), “The rising number of judicial vacancies prevents the prompt and timely administration of justice in the federal courts.” Delays in case resolution are most keenly felt by the less privileged, including criminal defendants languishing in jail and civil plaintiffs who cannot recover damages for injuries.

And much of the blame for the many vacancies belongs to blue slips:

Republican senators abused [blue slips] to prevent President Barack Obama from filling judgeships — keeping some seats open for years, presumably so they could be inherited by a Republican president to fill. Now Democrats are abusing blue slips, blocking Mr. Trump from filling the 100-plus vacancies he inherited and the dozens of new vacancies since then.

Partisans might argue that it is better to let a judgeship sit vacant, even for years, than to have it filled by a president from the other party. But this misunderstands the work of the federal courts.

As any federal judge or law clerk can tell you, the vast majority of cases heard by federal courts are not political. While important to the litigants, these garden-variety cases involve the straightforward application of settled law, and they would come out the same way regardless of the judge’s political views. Hot-button cases in the news are the exception, not the rule. Even the Supreme Court — which picks the few cases that it hears, and therefore has an especially politicized docket — decides about [two-thirds](http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SB_unanimity_20170628.pdf) of its cases by unanimous vote.

As a practical matter, it’s much less important to have a judge appointed by a Republican or a Democrat than it is to have a judge appointed, period — confirmed and hearing cases as soon as possible. A judge’s politics will make a difference in only a tiny fraction of cases, but her presence on the bench will make a huge difference in terms of resolving cases expeditiously.

So I don’t buy the partisan defense — this time from Democrats, previously from Republicans — of blue slips. But I do think this point, tweeted at me by Matthew Stiegler of the (excellent) [CA3blog](http://ca3blog.com/), is fair:

Put another way, is it fair for President Trump and Senate Republicans to reap a windfall of judicial appointments by scrapping blue slips now — especially when many of the vacancies they’re now filling were of their own making, by abusing blue slips (and also the filibuster) to block President Obama’s judicial nominees?

This does raise serious fairness concerns. I think this would be a more equitable approach, as I tweeted in response to Stiegler:

[](https://twitter.com/DavidLat/status/994274893524070400)

Of course, the partisanship and dysfunction that killed both the filibuster and now blue slips would probably also preclude any sort of “grand bargain” on judicial nominations.

Democrats will have to exact their revenge by winning future elections — which I predict that they will, even if we don’t yet know which ones. And when they do, they will enjoy the power over judicial vacancies that the Republicans currently possess:

In the short term, with filibusters and now blue slips effectively gone (at least for appellate nominees), President Trump will enjoy a greater ability to appoint judges than his predecessors, which might not sit well with his opponents. But going forward, presidents of both parties will benefit from this power — and so will the federal judiciary, which will operate at or near capacity for longer.

Both parties wanted filibusters and blue slips gone for political reasons. But their removal will actually reduce gamesmanship in nominations. The cynical practice of a senator using these tools to block or stall nominees will be much more difficult. Instead, vacancies will be filled on more of a rolling basis, not just in partisan spurts when a single party controls the White House and Senate.

So, let’s cheer the effective end of blue slips for judicial nominees. Today, their absence will benefit Republicans; tomorrow, their absence will benefit Democrats. But over the long run, the true winner will be the federal judiciary — and all of us.

The Times kept me to a word count — but I’m not so constrained here in the pages of Above the Law, so I’ll address a few more issues and concerns.

The defense of blue slips most frequently presented to me is that they give home-state senators an important and necessary voice in selecting judges from their states. I have a few responses.

First, recall that circuit judges are regional rather than state-based officials, so their rulings affect multiple states — all the states within their respective circuits, not just the state they happen to live in. So when senators use blue slips to stop qualified nominees from going forward, those actions — and the resulting unfilled vacancies and case delays — affect multiple states and their citizens.

Second, remember that blue slips continue to be honored — i.e., treated as conferring veto power — when it comes to district judges, whose influence is (generally) limited to the state in which each sits. This gives home-state senators some leverage when negotiating with the White House, even if the White House takes all or most of the circuit slots for itself. For examples of this at work, see the recent slates of Hawaii and Illinois judicial nominations, where Democratic senators and the Trump Administration managed to put together deals with bipartisan support.

(But to play devil’s advocate, should we perhaps get rid of blue slips for district judges too? In a day and age of [nationwide injunctions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/14/us/politics/federal-injunctions-judicial-power.html), the rulings of district judges can have nationwide reach, affecting the rights and obligations of people thousands of miles away.)

Third, it’s not clear to me that there’s much “home-state insight” into what makes a good circuit judge. Contrary to my colleague Joe Patrice, who [tweeted](https://twitter.com/JosephPatrice/status/994328542723887106) that scrapping blue slips amounts to “the Federalist Society decid[ing] federalism was inconvenient,” I don’t see this as a federalism issue. Federalism focuses on the division of power between federal and state governments, and the blue-slip debate is about the division of power between various federal officials (the president, home-state senators, and the Senate as a whole).

Furthermore, Joe makes this excellent point about “home-state insight” and the institution of blue slips:

[](https://twitter.com/JosephPatrice/status/994329811849015297)

He’s referring here to the ugly history of Southern senators using blue slips to block judges from their states who supported civil rights — another point in favor of abolishing blue slips.

Fourth, in response to the slippery-slope argument of “this will lead to a total nationalization of the judicial process, with no such thing as circuit seats tied to specific states” — an argument raised at the Bounds hearing by Senator Whitehouse (D-R.I.) — remember that, by statute (28 U.S. Code § 44), each state gets at least one circuit judge.

Fifth and finally, remember that nominees must still win approval from the Senate as a whole — and that opposition to a nominee from her home-state senator could certainly cause colleagues to vote against that nominee. So I don’t share Professor Carl Tobias’s [fear](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/10/senate-confirms-michael-brennan-u-s-court-appeals/598340002/) that scrapping blue slips gives the president the power to willy-nilly “stuff [nominees] down [senators’] throats.”

(Professor Tobias also observes that tossing blue slips weakens the Senate as an institution — or, at the very least, weakens the power of individual senators. That’s true, but remember: that when it comes to the demise of both the filibuster and now blue slips, the Senate [did this to itself](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/more-judicial-nominations-from-president-trump-and-more-judicial-emergencies/).)

Here’s a different, quite interesting argument raised against my position: could the demise of blue slips lead to a more polarized judiciary, the exact opposite of what I predict in my piece? As what one correspondent wrote me:

I’m much more pessimistic than you are about the direction things are heading. Far from this process of escalation leading to “vacancies [being filled] on more of a rolling basis,” I suspect this will all deepen a new status quo in which vacancies are only filled when the Senate and White House are filled by the same party. With no need to moderate appointments on the basis of blue slips, the White House can (and will) appoint outliers more easily. That will lead to a backlash from opposing Democrats or Republicans on the receiving end of the nominations, who will cry bad faith and refuse to vote on any nominations when they retake the Senate as a matter of principle, or engage in the same tactic when they retake both the Senate and White House. Add into this the new possibility (indeed, pattern) of presidential attacks on judges, and it seems only a matter of time until something boils over altogether.

This is certainly a possibility. My argument of reduced partisanship in an age without blue slips assumes something that has been true for most of recent history, but is (sadly) becoming less true today: if the president’s nominee is qualified and reasonable, she gets confirmed, even if she’s not necessarily who the Senate or individual senators might have picked. This is why qualified, mainstream judges have, at least in the past, generally cleared the Senate by healthy margins, regardless of who controls the White House and who controls the Senate (as long as they didn’t get filibustered or blue-slipped).

But sadly, in these polarized times, highly qualified and reasonable judges are now squeaking by with party-line votes. So I concede that my assumption might not hold going forward.

It’s hard to predict, however, which way the partisanship winds will blow. A different reader offers this observation about how blue-slip abuse exacerbates partisanship and reduces moderation:

Great piece in the NYT today – the country would be better off if both sides put down their swords on blue slips. My big concern about the abuse of blue slips in recent years is how it affects the partisan composition of the various courts of appeals. If home state senators get a veto, it is very hard for a Republican president to put judges on the Ninth Circuit and very hard for a Democratic president to put judges on the Fifth Circuit. The result is more and more perceived daylight between “liberal” and “conservative” appellate courts, which is terrible for the rule of law.

Agreed. So blue slips, rest in peace — and please don’t rise from the dead to stalk the federal judiciary ever again.

# Biglaw Bonus Announcement Delights With Earlier Payday Than Expected
## What better than money? Getting that money quicker.

Bonus season began in Biglaw over a week ago when Milbank gave the industry with a little kick in the pants with an early bonus announcement. Now Baker McKenzie has made their associates happy with a match to the industry standard with a change to the firm’s usual bonus payday. Because everyone loves a big bonus announcement, but getting the money earlier than expected makes it even sweeter.

The bonus scale is as follows:

Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012  – $100,000
Class of 2011+ – $100,000

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As noted in the full memo, bonuses will be paid by the firm on January 31st. Sure, some firms are paying bonuses in December, but considering the firm’s tradition of paying bonuses in March, this has come as a welcomed surprise, from a tipster:

People are happy the money is coming earlier this year — usually paid in mid-March.

Plus! The firm will pay above these market rates for “exceptional performance.”

# Associate Compensation Scorecard: Which Firms Have Announced Bonuses? (Fall 2018)
## Is your firm listed here? If not, what are the partners waiting for?

Since we broke the news of the market bonus scale for associates at large law firms in the United States — a trend that was [started by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/) on Monday, November 19, 2018 — many firms have quickly fallen in line and matched (or sometimes beaten) the scale. It’s still quite early in bonus season, so we’ve yet to hear from firms offering statements on why they’ve failed to match the market, and dozens upon dozens of firms have remained completely silent.

As usual, we are compiling a table of all the firms that have already matched the new bonus scale, the markets where those bonus matches were made, the minimum hours required to receive those bonuses (if available), and the date those bonuses will be paid. Today, we unveil that table for your viewing pleasure. We will be updating this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as news on bonuses is announced. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs clarification, [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Bonus%20Scorecard%20Correction).

Help us help you now (and if/when you decide to make a lateral move in the future). Let us know what your firm’s minimum billable hours targets are for bonus eligibility and when your firm will pay those bonuses. You generally must remain at your firm until the payout date to receive them, as stated in most memos, which could make it all the more difficult for you to leave your place of employment.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus season, everyone!

# The Best Brand In Biglaw Is Just Piling On
## Jones Day beat Skadden... again.

For the second year in a row, Jones Day has topped the list of the [Acritas U.S. Law Firm Brand Index](https://www.acritas.com/acritas-us-law-firm-brand-index-2018). [Last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/the-best-brand-in-biglaw-isnt-skadden-anymore/?rf=1), bolstered by publicity for work done by the Trump administration, they took over the top spot from Skadden, and in this year’s survey they built upon that lead. This, despite that fact that Skadden also increased its brand strength:

Jones Day is the strongest law firm brand in the US for the second consecutive year after surpassing five-year leader Skadden last year. While Skadden has strengthened its brand this year, Jones Day has seen a larger gain and increased its lead on the market.

Lizzy Duffy, VP of Acritas US said: “Jones Day is more favored this year for its practical style of delivery, along with its global coverage and breadth of services – all areas we know align with clients’ evolving needs especially now that half of legal departments are assigning responsibility for optimizing legal operations.”

The Brand Index is based on surveys of 2,130 in-house counsel who have senior responsibility for buying legal services in organizations with revenues of $50M and above. And it focuses on five main areas of competency:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

- Top of mind awareness
- Favorability
- Consideration for top-level litigation
- Consideration for major M&A
- Most used overall.
The majority of the top firms on the list improved overall or in one of the categories. But that doesn’t mean they should rest on their laurels. As Duffy notes, the threat from alternative service providers is coming:

“As clients look for ways to drive value in managing their legal work, the threat from alternatives will continue to rise. Our latest research study shows top of mind awareness of Axiom has almost tripled in four years in the US. Law firms must use this threat as an opportunity to adapt to clients’ current needs.”

Back in March, after completing an incredibly successful financial year against all odds in the face of a pandemic, DLA Piper decided it was high time to [increase associates’ salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/dla-piper-2021-salary-raise/?rf=1) outside of its major market offices. Slowly but surely, other firms began to follow in DLA’s footsteps: first came [Alston & Bird](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/alston-bird-special-bonus-2021/), and then came [King & Spalding](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/ks-special-bonuses/).

Which firm is next in line?

It’s Midwestern firm Taft Stettinius & Hollister, which is now doing business as Taft Law following its early 2020 merger with Minneapolis-based Briggs and Morgan. Effective July 1, the firm will [increase salaries](https://www.taftlaw.com/news-events/news/taft-increases-associate-compensation-in-all-markets-and-for-first-year-associates) for all associates by $10,000, and increase first-year salaries as well, based on the following matrix:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- Chicago: From $175,000 to $190,000
- Cincinnati, Columbus, Dayton, and Indianapolis: From $125,000 to $135,000
- Cleveland: From $135,000 to $145,000
- Minneapolis: From $140,000 to $150,000
The firm’s Chicago office is the only one that will be following the prevailing market rate for most Biglaw firms. Will that office’s bonuses match the prevailing market rates as well? Time will tell.

Robert J. Hicks, Taft’s chairman and managing partner, said of the increases:

Part of our ‘Play to Win’ strategy is to hire great talent, both on campus and laterally. To do that, we need to do everything well, including providing highly competitive compensation and benefits packages in each of our markets. Given our strong financial performance and growth, this strategy – at the direction of our executive committee – is clearly delivering results for the firm and our clients.

Here’s what Lisa Watson, Taft’s chief recruiting officer, had to say about the raises:

We are in the talent business. The market has become hyper competitive for top talent and this decision is based on understanding current trends and taking a long-term view. Our ability to hire top talent is critical to providing exemplary client service and to achieving all of our quality, cultural – including diversity and inclusion – and financial goals.

Congratulations to everyone at Taft on the well-deserved raises. Which firm will be the next to share the wealth with associates?

Please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or email (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salary”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept confidential.

# You 'Couldn't Find Anyone' To Diversify Your Panel? Sell That Bridge To Someone Else

There are so many things in our legal world to fulminate about that I hardly know where to start. So, in other words, [my dander is up](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/get-ones-dander-up). And for those of you who aren’t familiar with the term, it means to become angry or annoyed.  Here’s more than you probably will ever need or want to know about the [origin of the phrase](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/get-your-dander-up.html), but it may be worth using at a networking event. One never knows.

Two things this past week or so particularly set me off. The first was a flyer for a [roundtable discussion on intellectual property](https://www.dailyjournal.com/articles/351193-intellectual-property-roundtable), subtitled “experts weigh in on the year’s hottest issues in patent litigation.” So far, so good. However, the roundtable had no diversity, none.  Unless my vision is worse than I think it is with my 3.0 readers, all I saw on the brochure were white males, no women lawyers, no minority lawyers.

Hey, folks, this is 2019, and if the Oscars can start to get a grip, why can’t you? I mean by “you” the Daily Journal (the Los Angeles legal newspaper) and California Lawyer. I refuse to believe that there are no women and/or minority lawyers who have expertise on the topics.  And if you tell me that you couldn’t find anyone, I’m not buying that bridge. Is anyone else pissed off about this? Or is it just me, an old lady lawyer, whistling in the wind yet again? And I can’t whistle, but [Humphrey Bogart could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MheNUWyROv8).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I’ve been pushing for diverse panels ever since I was in-house and saw programs sponsored by big muckety-muck groups with no women on them, and the answer was always, “We couldn’t find anyone.” This excuse came from a Biglaw partner who should have known better, did know better, but was chagrined at being called to task for something that shouldn’t have needed any pointing out. I wonder if anything has truly changed since then. Surely there are women and minority lawyers who are experts in patent litigation.

I don’t get how some lawyers are still tone deaf, clueless, whatever your choice of adjectives, about the need for diversity in the profession, and how a program like this sends, at least to me, all the wrong signals about the value of a diverse profession. Joe Patrice’s [recent column](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/sullivan-if-a-biglaw-firm-falls-in-the-woods-and-no-one-issues-a-press-release-about-its-lack-of-diversity/) underscores that point with his discussion of the most recent partnership class announced by Paul Weiss.

Why is diversity so hard? It shouldn’t be with women composing [half of incoming law school classes](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/business/dealbook/women-majority-of-us-law-students-first-time.html). The numbers are less-than stellar for minorities.

That brings me to my second “dander up” experience this past week. This story is Exhibit A for why law schools are doing such a miserable job of turning out practice-ready lawyers. I am not making this up.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
U.S. News and World Report is rolling out a new measurement: [“scholarly impact” of law schools](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/new-u-s-news-law-school-ranking/). This would be a second measurement, after its rankings, but this one would be based on law review citation counts. I am not joking.

LawProfBlawg [says it](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/we-must-measure-the-size-of-our-scholarly-impact/) better than I ever could. “So, I could have sworn law students are looking for a quality education without mortgaging their future too much with the ability to have a rewarding career…Who will the rankings really serve apart from U.S. News? My guess is that it will serve the egos of professors who live for those rankings. It will not serve the students in any way.” Precisely.

Everyone is hollering about the fact that law school doesn’t prepare lawyers ready to take their places in the profession. Law professors jostling for citation rankings will pay even less attention to the students while they “campaign” in whatever way one does for such things, while the students are ignored. Having just endured another Hollywood love fest makes me wonder about what effect these rankings will have on professors (tenured or tenure track of course) who are too busy to teach, leaving that to adjuncts who actually know something about the nitty-gritty of practice and who can and do tell the truth about the underbellies of the profession. What if professors spent less time on research and writing and more time on teaching, mentoring, and clinical projects that help students succeed?

Will there be an awards ceremony for those who have the most citations? Should the award be in the form of a hand clapping itself on the back? It’s bad enough that many students are not getting the legal education they are paying for. Just look at recent bar exam passage rates. Students want a legal education that prepares them for the profession. They want the best legal education they can “afford” that will enable them to pass the bar, get jobs, and help clients. Isn’t that what law school is supposed to do?

And if these professors purportedly make an impact on legal academia and the law, then why is legal education such a mess? I doubt if many peeps applying to law school even know what law review is and could care less who wins a citation count derby. If you took a poll of law school applicants, would any one even care about that in deciding where to apply? Perhaps those applicants think that they will spend their legal career working on very important cases, when the truth for most students is much more mundane. Will law students think that they’ll get even less bang for their student loan bucks?

One final thought: if you’ve taken the February bar, please do yourself a favor and do NOT discuss your answers with ANYONE. Just because someone else answered a question differently than you did doesn’t mean that she’s right and you are wrong. Don’t perseverate. Get some sleep, do something fun, and STFU.

# Feds Seek Top-End Prison Sentence For Biglaw Partner

The collapse of LeClairRyan [prompted its share of recriminations](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/leclairryan-trustee-targets-firm-co-founder-unitedlex-lawsuit-2021-08-25/), but while finger-pointing between the former partners and UnitedLex continues, one bankruptcy partner found himself caught out in a multi-year embezzlement scheme.

The firm’s former Chief Legal Officer, Bruce H. Matson, admitted to misappropriating around $4 million from bankruptcy trust funds that he oversaw, improperly distributing some of those funds to himself and another attorney. Most of the total misappropriation came in the from wind-down funds that he sent around in 2019 that weren’t supposed to be distributed at that time. After the scheme got noticed, prosecutors say Matson tried to conceal his wrongdoing by misleading the Bankruptcy Court.

From the [Richmond Times-Dispatch](https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/government-seeking-tough-prison-term-for-disbarred-lawyer-who-misappropriated-4-million-defense-asks-for/article_3c00343a-5e8b-5428-ba9c-5623298a3670.html):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Over the course of a four-year period, the defendant designed and executed a multi-step and multifaceted scheme to defraud the LFG Liquidation Trust of as much money as possible … diverting the bulk of those siphoned-off or embezzled funds into bank accounts that he controlled; transferring some to his associates; and directing the remainder to his law firm to settle a personal debt.

Matson’s attorneys are asking for a 37-month sentence — at the low-end of the Guidelines — arguing that Matson has been cooperating in achieving complete restitution. The government, on the other hand, is looking at a 46-month sentence, underscoring the gravity of Matson’s betrayal of his fiduciary position.

As numbers on a page, nine months may seem like an insignificant difference, but in the life of a guy who will be 67 when the distinction comes into play it will matter quite a bit. No one wants a system that allows affluent criminals to use their resources to plead “no harm, no foul” by paying everyone back — that just encourages bad behavior. Indeed, rich people deserve prison more than the average defendant because fines have limited impact.

But the answer doesn’t have to be the top-end of a prison range. Three years is a long time to be locked up for anyone.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Forming Connections With Other Lawyers Is Easy
## 'Judicial geography' can be easier than you think.

This weekend, I went back to my undergraduate alma mater for a 75th anniversary celebration for the founding of the college. At the event, I interacted with some people I knew as a student, but I also met tons of people who attended my college decades before me (and a few who sadly graduated a decade or more after me!) During this event, I had the chance to meet numerous lawyers, which was no surprise since my college churned out tons of professionals who enter the legal field. What struck me was how I had a connection to many of these lawyers, whether due to mutual friends or mutual employment backgrounds or some other way. This reinforced for me that the legal profession is much smaller than people might think, and how there are very few degrees of separation from other lawyers.

It can be easy to think that the legal profession is so vast that people likely do not have close connections with other people who work in the legal profession. There are literally over a million lawyers in this country, and law schools churn out tens of thousands of new ones each year. It can be easy to think that lawyers might not have a connection unless it’s a readily apparent one such as where they went to school or where they worked.

When interacting with these lawyers at the alumni event, I was able to identify mutual lawyers that I knew with all of the attorneys. I worked at four law firms before I started my own shop four and a half years ago, and these lawyers have entered many different roles within the legal profession. It was easy enough for me to identify a lawyer with whom I worked that was not employed at the same place as each of the lawyers I met. In other instances, I was able to identify mutual contacts with whom I attended law school. My law school is one of the larger law schools, so there were tons of law students who enrolled in my law school at the same time as me, and this made it easy to make a connection.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In other instances, I was able to connect with lawyers because we had all appeared in front of various judges at one point or another during our career. Although I do not do much federal work these days, I have worked on matters before some of the more well-known federal judges in my area. If another lawyer I meet is also a litigator, it is easy enough to connect with this attorney with a war story from appearing in front of the same judge as the other lawyer. With state judges, this can be more difficult, since there are often more state judges in a given jurisdiction, and people might be less likely to remember an appearance in front of a state judge. However, litigators can usually find a connection with commonalities in their practices, such as the judges with which they have experience.

Forging a connection with other lawyers is important to progressing in one’s legal career. Individuals attorneys who meet at alumni events, conferences, or other professional settings can refer work to an attorney or perhaps answer a question about an unfamiliar legal subject. In addition, lawyers that you meet at various events can end up being on the other side of a legal matter and the prior connection can help you be more effective for your client. The most successful lawyers are usually the ones with the biggest networks since they can draw upon their connections to generate business and most effectively practice law.

In any case, if you ever find yourself interacting with a lawyer you might not know, it can be relatively simple to find a connection. From my experience “judicial geography” can be easier than you think, and a quick rundown of someone’s work history could reveal a common connection. In addition, commonalities in practice areas can also forge a bond between attorneys. Making such connections can not only make events more fun, but they can have a positive impact on an attorney’s career as well.

Donald Trump wants YOU… to serve on the Supreme Court! (Photo by Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images)

This afternoon brings bad news for President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the D.C. Circuit. The chances of Judge Garland getting confirmed during the “lame duck” session of Congress, after the presidential election but before the inauguration of our new president, now depend very heavily on Hillary Clinton winning the presidency. Donald Trump just announced his shortlist of 11 possible SCOTUS nominees, and none of them are crazy enough to make Chief Judge Garland more attractive to Republicans than a Trump appointee.

Far from being crazy, the Trump SCOTUS contenders are, as columnist Kayleigh McEnany [predicted they would be](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/donald-trumps-supreme-court-nominees/?rf=1), very much in the vein of the late Justice Scalia. They all wouldn’t necessarily agree with the late justice on every issue, but taken as a whole, they are constitutional conservatives and textualists. They are also, by conventional standards, highly qualified; they’re all well-regarded, currently sitting federal and state judges. The Trump shortlist does not include [Elisabeth Hasselbeck or Shaquille O’Neal](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/president-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist-5-possible-nominees/).

In a statement, Trump said the list “is representative of the kind of constitutional principles I value” and said that, as president, he would use it “as a guide to nominate our next United States Supreme Court Justices.”

His campaign stressed the list was compiled “first and foremost, based on constitutional principles, with input from highly respected conservatives and Republican Party leadership.”

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Word on the street is that Trump consulted folks at the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation in coming up with his Supreme Court shortlist, and these eleven names are certainly consistent with that hypothesis. All are Republicans themselves or Republican appointees.

It’s interesting to see who is not on the list — usual GOP SCOTUS contenders like former Solicitor General Paul Clement, Judge Neil Gorsuch (10th Cir.), Judge Brett Kavanaugh (D.C. Cir.), and Judge Jeffrey Sutton (6th Cir.). This might be surprising at first glance, but it actually makes sense to me: I suspect that Donald Trump found these folks to be too “Establishment” for his tastes.

I’d say that his shortlist is, well, “Trumpy” — conservative, yes, but with a contrarian or anti-Establishment streak. It has practically no judges from the East or West Coasts, which might reflect Trump’s anti-elitism (the only judge arguably from one of the coasts is Judge Hardiman, but he’s based in Pittsburgh rather than Philadelphia, so he doesn’t really count). And it’s heavy on state judges, which might reflect Trump’s populist orientation (given that state high-court judges, unlike federal judges, are often elected).

The Trump list is almost evenly divided between federal and state judges. The federal judges are Colloton, Sykes, Gruender, Hardiman, Kethledge, and Pryor; the state-court judges are Eid, Larsen, Lee, Stras, and Willett.

Two other observations. First, as is typical for SCOTUS nominees in this day and age, the potential justices are young; they range from 41 to 58, with most in their late 40s or early 50s. Second, the Trump shortlist isn’t long on diversity. Just three of the 11 judges are women, and all 11 are white (sorry, my fellow Asian-Americans, Thomas Lee is a white guy). I told you this list was Trumpy.

# There Are Counsel Out There Making Less Than Associates Now
## The overlooked attorneys who make Biglaw run are not receiving the love from their firms.

We tried to gather information about the pay of special counsel and income partners last week, and while we’ve heard from a number of you, we thought the response may have been muted by the holiday week. So let’s try this again.

While associates are understandably giddy about their new raises, there’s another group of lawyers in the Biglaw ecosphere who are feeling more than a little left out. Whether the firm brands them Senior Counsel, Special Counsel, Of Counsel — the possibilities abound — the senior lawyers who make up that critical tier of senior experience just below the ranks of partners exist in a weird state of limbo that often gets overlooked, especially when it comes to money. Just this year, we heard about an elite Biglaw firm [stiffing its counsel on bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/whats-going-on-with-counsel-bonuses/?rf=1). As you’d suspect, raises come with their own issues.

In 2016, we discovered some counsel put in the [awkward position](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/whats-up-with-counsel-salaries/) of earning less than the senior associates right below them. That’s the extreme case, of course, but many other counsel were left making just a peppercorn more than the top of the associate pay scale. Meanwhile, other firms offer counsel hefty paydays. So where are the firms in the wake of this round of raises?

So far, very few memos even include counsel on the distribution, let alone explicitly mention counsel compensation. But we have every reason to believe that there are counsel at more than one firm who now are making less than the senior associates staffing their matters.

We want to hear as much as we can from you about counsel compensation. We understand that, at some firms, counsel are such a rare breed that it’s impossible to tip us without giving oneself away, but if a tipster has any insights that they can share, please do so. We’ll compile this information to better inform the market.

So if you’re a counsel (or any firm citizen concerned about the counsel) and have some insight to share — either a raise or no action — please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Counsel%20Pay%20) (subject line: “Counsel Pay”) to let us know.

# Donald Trump Made Americans Hate Lawyers Again
## And lawyers want absolutely nothing to do with the firms that helped the former president.

Thanks in part to former President Donald Trump, the legal profession, the justice system, and the rule of law writ large has been through the wringer over the course of the past four years. From the Muslim ban, revoking DACA, and tearing families apart at the border to stacking federal courts with unqualified judges and pushing through controversial Supreme Court justices to using the Attorney General and the Justice Department as personal attorneys to the Biglaw firms that happily accepted the ex-president as a client until it was not okay anymore to not one, but two impeachments, the Trump administration has really impacted what the general public thinks of lawyers — and not necessarily in a good way.

We polled more than 150 attorneys from law firms of all sizes and a varied number of practice areas to find out how the legal profession has changed thanks to the Trump administration. Below are their interesting responses.

How do you think the widespread legal challenges to Trump administration actions have affected the general perception of the legal profession?



This one was a bit of a toss-up. An equal portion of respondents (29.03%) reported that the widespread legal challenges to Trump administration actions have greatly harmed the reputation of the legal profession or have had no effect on the reputation of the legal profession.

Over half of respondents reported that they believe the reputation of the legal profession was harmed greatly by the actions of lawyers in the Trump administration.

How do you think firms’ reputations were affected through advising on Trump administration efforts, like the challenges to the 2020 election?



Almost 60 percent of respondents reported that they believed firms’ reputations were harmed greatly through advising Trump administration efforts.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
How do you perceive the criticism that has been leveled at law firms involved in these efforts?



The largest cohort of respondents (47.37%) reported that they believed criticism leveled at firms involved in such efforts is extremely justified.

Would a firm’s role in representing the Trump administration affect your decision on whether to join that firm?



Here, 75.86% of respondents stated that a firm’s role in representing the Trump administration would negatively affect their decision to join that firm.

Would a firm’s role in challenging the Trump administration affect your decision on whether to join that firm?



Almost 70 percent of respondents said that a firm’s decision to challenge the Trump administration would positively affect their decision to join the firm.

Now that Joe Biden is president, will we see improvement in the way the public perceives the legal profession? It’s only been a few weeks, but we have hope for a brighter future for lawyers with a new administration in place.

All bar exam results from the July 2016 administration of the test have officially been released, and in California’s case, it seems that the absolute worst may have been saved for last. The results of the state’s exam were scheduled for mailing on Friday, and test-takers were able to see whether their names were on the [pass list](http://apps.calbar.ca.gov/exam/) on Friday evening.

Save for a few states, bar passage rates have continued to decline nationwide, and many have been waiting to see if California’s passage rates for the July 2016 exam would tank as badly as they did in July 2015, which were the worst the state had seen in nearly three decades. If you thought last year was bad, just wait until you see this year’s results.

According to a press release from the State Bar of California, the overall pass rate for the July 2016 exam was 43 percent, while the pass rate for first-time takers was 56 percent. In July 2015, the overall pass rate was 46.6 percent, and the pass rate for first-time takers was 60 percent. Although California’s overall pass rate dropped by 3.6 percentage points, its examinees seemed to be more able than test-takers in other states. The state’s mean scaled MBE score was 1421 compared with the national average of 1403.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Perhaps that bright spot ought to be taken with a grain of salt, because this is the [lowest overall pass rate](http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/4/documents/gbx/GBXpassratesummary_201607.pdf) California has seen for the July administration of the bar since results were released in the fall of 1986, when only 44.4 percent of all test-takers passed the exam. The state hasn’t seen an overall pass rate this low in 32 years. In fact, this passage rate is historically mediocre — it’s actually the third-lowest summer passage rate the state has seen since 1951, when the July passage rate was just 37.6 percent.

Year	Overall Pass Rate
July 2016	43 percent passed
July 2015	46.6 percent passed
July 2014	48.6 percent passed
July 2013	55.8 percent passed

Once again, graduates of ABA-accredited law schools displayed an obvious advantage over their peers who attended California-accredited or unaccredited law schools. We’re eager to see the pass rates for individual law schools when that data is available.

Congratulations to everyone who was lucky enough to have passed the California bar exam. Fewer than half of your peers passed, so this is really quite the achievement.

# I Owe My Soul To The Law Firm Store...

We’ve said it [multiple](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/everyone-go-back-to-the-office-but-heres-a-firm-branded-toy-for-your-trouble/) [times](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/top-5-firm-matches-bonus-scale/) now: don’t offer any kind of seasonal “gift” until you’ve ponied up bonuses. Not only is it just tacky, it’s a slap in the face to associates who are keeping one eye glued to their inbox awaiting the inevitable bonus match. Whatever the “gift” may be, it’s not going to top the bonuses that associates rely upon to get out of law school debt.

Yet Venable seems to have missed this memo like associates are still missing their bonus memo. Rather than announce the DPW match, the firm sent around a $75 gift credit [TO THEIR OWN STORE](https://venable.americommerce.com/)!

At least the parties are virtual this year… avoiding a lesson [Latham learned the hard way](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-holiday-party-turns-into-covid-outbreak/).

You might be thinking: maybe the Venable store is like the [Davis Polk pandemic bonus gift store](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/grading-all-the-davis-polk-gift-bonuses/) — the one where the firm offered associates TVs and golf outings and high-end workout equipment. NOPE! It’s just a glorified Zazzle site with the “Venable” brand on trinkets. A glorified Zazzle site associates can shop with a whole SEVENTY-FIVE SMACKAROOS! Let the good times roll.

Again, there’s nothing wrong with firm-branded gifts. I still use bags and umbrellas I got as a practicing attorney. But building a company store and paying lawyers $75 in scrip before announcing bonuses is just a chef’s kiss of an unforced error.

# Law Firms Shouldn't Hold Mandatory Events After Work Hours
## The benefits to an employer should not take precedence over associates being able to enjoy their nights and weekends in peace.

When people work at law firms, they usually need to attend various social events and trainings in addition to the time they spend billing hours for clients. Although some of these supplemental events are voluntary, in many instances, attendance at such extracurricular events may be implicitly or explicitly mandatory. To add insult to injury, law firms sometimes require employees to attend mandatory events on nights and weekends when employees might otherwise have off. Nevertheless, law firms should try to hold mandatory work events during work hours as much as possible so employers can maintain work-life balance and not interfere with the personal time of employees.

Before I started my own practice, I worked at various law firms who approached mandatory social events and trainings a little differently. I had an employer that required all of their associates to attend a retreat once a year. The retreat was a fun time to catch up with colleagues and bond outside of the office, and although it was mandatory, people usually looked forward to it.

This employer held the work retreat during the week on business days. As a result, most of the people who did not need to travel too far to attend the retreat could travel to the retreat during the work week and travel home after the retreat with minimal impact on their social life. In addition, the firm scheduled the retreats to end on a Friday, so people could extend their stay in the city where the retreat occurred, which was an added bonus that other associates and myself took advantage of.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
However, I also worked at a firm that required associates to attend a retreat every two years, and the retreat mostly occurred over the weekend. Of course, there are a few reasons why law firms would want to organize retreats over the weekend. A firm can take a huge billing hit if all of the associates are unable to log hours for a day or two. In addition, law firms can suffer interruptions if their associates or large swaths of their employees are unavailable during the work week. However, the benefits to an employer should not take precedence over associates being able to enjoy their weekends in peace, and law firms should try not to schedule trainings, retreats, and the like over the weekend when it is possible to schedule the events during the week.

On a smaller scale, law firms also disrupt the personal time of employees when they require attorneys to attend some social events and trainings during evenings over the week. Mandatory holiday parties, so long as they only occur once a year might be OK, since this is an established tradition of many law firms and other employers, and an annual event is not a huge imposition on employees, even if the event occurs after hours. However, some firms have events after hours on a more regular basis that invades the personal time of employees and makes it harder for them to enjoy their free time.

For instance, it is common for law firms to have semi-mandatory happy hours that all members of a team or an office are asked to attend. If such events are truly voluntary, then it is more appropriate for such events to be scheduled for after hours. However, it may be problematic for law firms to schedule such events for after work hours since employees should not be required to sacrifice their personal time so that law firms can realize the benefits of mandatory social events.

Rather than schedule social events for after hours, law firms should try more to schedule events during the course of a workday. For instance, if a law firm wants members of a team or an office to come together in a social setting, there is no reason why the firm cannot arrange to hold a breakfast or a lunch with staff. Such events can occur during work hours so employees will not need to sacrifice their personal time for the benefit of a firm. In addition, such events have many of the benefits of social events that occur after hours since people can just as easily bond over breakfast or lunch as they can over dinner or another after-hours event. Furthermore, trainings that are scheduled after hours can just as easily be held during work hours so that employees can get all of the instruction of the trainings without needed to sacrifice their personal time and invade the work-life balance.

Of course, much of this analysis applies to the pre- and post-COVID world since law firms are much less able to schedule social events and trainings due to the pandemic. However, hopefully, the work-from-home experience will make law firms more cognizant of preserving work-life balance in the future. And law firms can help preserve this balance by holding as many trainings and social events as possible during work hours in the future.

# Younger Lawyers: What Are Your Career Goals?

[](http://bit.ly/2S5Dg4K)In the not so distant past, the spectrum of possible “career paths” for new lawyers was both fairly well-defined and fairly limited. Most people entering the industry knew that they were either going to join a big firm and try to get on the “fast” track for partnership, or that they’d work at said firm for a few years before transitioning over to the legal department of one of the firm’s clients. But that was it. Those were the basically the only options for new lawyers hoping to live the legal dream.

Today, however, such longstanding traditions between firms and incoming associates have largely disappeared. Now, the number of possible career paths is nearly as diverse and individualized as the number of new lawyers seeking professional advancement.

In order to dig deeper into the dynamics of this apparent cultural change in law firms, we have partnered with our friends at [Major Lindsey & Africa](http://bit.ly/2ptVOJW) to run a series of (very brief, we promise) surveys designed to capture the perspective of lawyers in various stages of their careers. In this survey (the second of three), we examine “[Goals](http://bit.ly/2S5Dg4K),” with the hopes of understanding more about the motivations behind both internal and external transitions associates may make on their way to “the dream gig.” Please take a couple of minutes and [share your thoughts here](http://bit.ly/2S5Dg4K). (Please note we are not exclusively interested in hearing from millennials; lawyers of all ages are encouraged to take [the survey](http://bit.ly/2S5Dg4K).)

[](http://bit.ly/2S5Dg4K)

If you have not taken the first survey in our series, “[Priorities](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_79S5zZLTTNTlXNj),” please feel free to do so here.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

The Supreme Court [punts on a thorny felony murder case](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/it-looks-like-sotomayor-is-1-of-3-supreme-court-justices-who-actually-believes-the-whole-do-the-crime-do-the-time-thing/), prompting a conversation over whether the use and abuse of the rule can ever truly be reformed. There’s also a super biller out there who [managed to bill an average of over 10 hours a day](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/the-biglaw-attorney-billing-the-most-hours-in-2022/) last year. Presumably the attorney is weeping in a corner somewhere. Finally, Disney took its fight with Ron DeSantis up a notch [with a new lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/disney-desantis-lawsuit-filed/) that [hasn’t made everyone happy](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/we-shouldnt-have-to-choose-between-disney-whipping-desantis-and-a-dickensian-hellscape/).

# Kirkland Shortens Partnership Track... Will Anyone Else Follow?
## Nine years for equity partnership at this Biglaw behemoth.

All the Biglaw buzz right now may be on [bonus announcements](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2021/) — [or the lack thereof](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/cravath-already-kicked-off-bonus-season-but-where-are-all-the-bonuses/), but money isn’t the only way for a firm to distinguish itself. In the midst of an altogether furious lateral market, particularly in transactional spaces, Kirkland has added another arrow to the brand quiver, deciding to shorten its equity partnership track to nine years.

The partnership track that defined the industry for decades put associates up after eight years. Despite Biglaw quietly pushing out that timeframe over the last several years, its vestigial impact remains in the salary and bonus charts that top off after eight years before dropping senior associates into the twilight realm of “Class of 2014+.” Kirkland isn’t ready to return to Biglaw’s glory days, but it’s hoping to shake things up by pulling back from the 10 or more year tracks that firms have increasingly adopted.

But will anyone else follow?

[Weil already shortened](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/a-valid-critique-of-weil-gotshals-new-partnership-program/) its partner track by a couple of years back in 2018 without generating many waves. That said, Weil isn’t the behemoth that an “Am Law 1” firm is. Though Kirkland’s status as the top grossing firm around could also blunt the impact of this decision, with firms writing off Kirkland’s move on the grounds that Kirkland operates in a class of their own. The firm already pays a premium over market bonuses and firms feel no pressure to match that.

And not for nothing, the firm has a history of losing partners in the lateral market [dating back years](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/amid_partner_turnover_kirkland_reportedly_requires_longer_notice_before_dep). Whether it’s just natural attrition or the firm getting a little passive-aggressively cutthroat nudging equity partners out the door if they don’t produce, turnover would make it less skin off Kirkland’s tail to make partners earlier and course correct if that doesn’t work out. Other firms still treat equity partners as “made men” (or women or other) without giving them [the Tommy DeVito treatment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R29YnbjxfzQ) for not making quota.

But even if tightening up on partnership tracks isn’t an option for every peer firm, it’s certainly on the table for some of them. As midlevel experience in corporate markets is at a premium, dangling a shorter path to partnership could be a key incentive.

Because most firms in the Am Law 100 playground have the resources to keep matching bonuses, but loosening the iron grip on profit-sharing? That’s going to cause some firms to flinch.

# Is Diversity Dead?
## Companies shouldn’t dare think of cutting back on equity and justice at a time like this, but rather, double down.

Over drinks recently, a Fortune 50 legal department executive declared to me “Our diversity initiatives are about to be completely dead. It’s all cost-cutting all the time now.”

The boldness of the declaration was a bit shocking.

Amidst the Black Lives Matter movement, a broader public focus on sustainability, and in the wake of a host of #MeToo scandals, companies began to take supplier diversity more seriously.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
We’ve just gone through a pandemic, where companies slashed costs to remain alive. There was a fear during the worst of it that corporations would deprioritize initiatives around culture and impact that didn’t directly contribute to the bottom line. But as the economy shifted back into gear with vaccines, employers turned their focus to retaining top talent. Initiatives that created connection between employees and employers, as well as other employees, have proven critical to navigating the “great resignation.”

But now we’re facing a more tumultuous set of economic circumstances. Companies are staring at the prospect of slowing or negative economic growth amid the highest inflation rates in recent memory. Financing for both companies and their customers is more expensive, which will hurt growth.

All of this is forcing cost-cutting directives passed down from the board level that hit corporate legal departments. Such cuts could come in the form of internal headcount, which is significantly painful to execute. They can come from sweating external counsel relationships for better performance at lower cost. And they can come from deferring nonessential technology investments.

The net effect of all of this is a risk that companies begin to deprioritize longer-term initiatives to reshape their departments and impact the broader legal profession as they focus strictly on core spending. I’ve written extensively about how corporate legal teams have been spending an increasing amount of time and attention on ESG-related goals like ensuring their legal departments match their values. But will this all go by the wayside?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
For those companies that have always deprioritized the issue, the current economic climate is an excuse to continue to do so. And for those that had made more performative commitments, it will become increasingly clear that they weren’t serious. While companies may continue to say the right things, a big piece of this will be slower progress on putting programs into place that systematically commit their departments to goals beyond their core functions.

But what about those that have already begun down the journey of, say, making sure their external counsel field diverse legal teams for their matters? Will they too cut back?

Omar Sweiss, founder and CEO of [Justice Bid](https://www.justicebid.com/), a diversity analytics and outside counsel selection technology platform for corporate law departments, makes the case for a brighter outlook. “For the companies that have operationalized diversity into their day to day, it’s not going away.” Sweiss tells me that the companies that have best operationalized diversity are those that have clear baseline data and both track and audit progress. Creating internal processes to give different parts of the legal department points for making diverse selections makes a huge difference, Sweiss says.

Adrian Peyer, CEO of [Impactvise](https://www.impactvise.com/), which provides ESG analytics on the legal industry, agrees. “Given the current economic and geopolitical uncertainties, there may be some companies continuing [to believe] that ESG can only be pursued in strong economic times. But we at Impactvise believe that the majority of the companies who have started or are already well advanced on their ESG journey will continue prioritizing ESG actions as they understand that it is no longer just profits which count, but also prosperity.”

Peyer points out the same is true with the law firms themselves: “Looking from the law firm perspective, we continue to see a high interest not only on the ESG advisory side of the house, but also on the internal efforts to align the law firms ESG actions with their clients and with the expectations of their employees.”

Indeed, both Sweiss and Peyer agree that now is the time to accelerate efforts rather than pull back.

Sweiss points out that when thinking about how economic crises impact society, especially under-represented communities, companies shouldn’t dare think of cutting back on equity and justice at a time like this, but rather, double down. Peyer points out that regulatory imperatives for broader ESG compliance are not going anywhere, so companies have no choice but to keep it front of mind.

For my part, I think we will see a shakeout of companies that are serious and not serious about the issue. Diversity or sustainability aren’t just values that a company pursues to show alignment with public opinion, though, no doubt, many take that route.

Instead, these are core values that drive performance for companies — and external counsel management programs are all designed to drive better results from outside law firms. Diverse staff bring diverse perspectives and novel problem-solving approaches. One [Deloitte study ](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/deloitte-review/issue-22/diversity-and-inclusion-at-work-eight-powerful-truths.html)found that inclusion and diversity enhances innovation by about 20% and reduces risk by 30%. Sustainable practices reduce waste and force companies to drive efficiency. Why wouldn’t you want suppliers who are innovative, less risky, and efficient?

That’s why, at [Hence](http://www.hence.ai), we think about ESG criteria as part of the holistic and ongoing assessment of law firms. Is it helpful to know which law firm is the most diverse if you don’t also know if they are driving quality for your organization? Or that a law firm has recently signed the UN Global Compact without knowing if they already handle sensitive matters for your organization?

If you only know data about diversity and sustainability in isolation of supplier performance, then that’s a lot less helpful. But when you can see the full integrated picture of how your law firm suppliers are performing, then it becomes clear that such data is a key part of the puzzle and not extraneous or disposable detail.

Simply put, choosing law firm partners that see the value in innovation and efficiency makes good business sense, regardless of where we are in the economic cycle. No doubt there will be a temptation to cut back on new initiatives as the economy slows. But it is up to stakeholders both internally and externally to make the case for why this is a risky idea.

# Some Law Firms Have Misleading Employment Data
## There are many ways that law firms fudge their employment numbers,

About a decade ago, many law schools advertised somewhat misleading employment data. For instance, certain law schools listed the median starting salaries of graduates based on sample sizes that were unreasonably small so the statistic did not give an accurate picture of the salaries that graduates could expect. In addition, some law schools played games with the percentage of graduates employed at graduation and nine months after graduation so that the employment outcomes of these schools seemed better than they actually were. Thankfully, legal organizations and nonprofits, including [Law School Transparency](https://www.lawschooltransparency.com/), helped highlight how certain law schools were providing potentially misleading statistics, and this started a shift in legal education. Indeed, it is much more difficult now for law schools to fudge their employment data, and this is good for law students and applicants.

However, law firms still routinely advertise misleading employment statistics, and that can have an impact on the decisions of individuals who may choose to apply for jobs at such firms. More effort should be devoted to reducing any potentially misleading statistics so that applicants can have an accurate picture of the employment data at a firm.

Many law firms provide their employment data to employment directories and other organizations so that people can purportedly get a sense of salaries and other employment information at these shops. Every time I was on the hunt for a new job in my career, I relied on such directories to determine if I wanted to apply to a given firm. However, the statistics advertised were rarely accurate when compared to the actual reality at many law firms.

For instance, numerous law firms advertise their starting salaries, and some law firms advertise their pay scale for associates of all kinds of seniority. This is perhaps the most critical employment statistic for any applicant at a firm, since most people choose to work for one law firm or another based on how much money they are paid. However, firms often do not pay many associates the starting salary advertised or stick to their purported pay scale for numerous attorneys at the firm.

For instance, many law firms pay attorneys different amounts of money depending on the practice area of an associate. Of course, clients who have work in given practice areas may pay more money than others, so it makes sense that associates will be paid different amounts of money depending on the type of work they do. However, law firms should at least advertise that starting salaries differ between practice areas so applicants have the most information possible.

I have been misled by inaccurate employment data of law firms at several points in my career. For example, several years after graduating from law school, I applied to work in a mass-torts practice group of a national law firm. Naturally, I thought that I would be paid at least the advertised starting salary. In actuality, the salary offered to me was far less, even though I had several years of experience. I would have appreciated knowing what the actual starting salary was for people in my situation before beginning the application process.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
At other firms, the advertised starting salary only applies to attorneys who start at the firm through summer programs and then progress at the firm through the in-house promotion process. Lateral hires to a firm may be paid less money because the quality of their work cannot purportedly be evaluated as easily as attorneys who have worked at a firm from the beginning of their careers. This seems reasonable, but firms should advertise the complexity in determining compensation and not lead people into thinking a firm has a lockstep compensation formula.

Another statistic that is somewhat misleading is how long it takes to become partner at a shop. Many firms advertise in employment directories if they are partnership track and how many years it typically takes to become an equity or a nonequity partner so people can evaluate the promotion process. However, firms rarely advertise the percentage of people who start at a firm and eventually leave before they can be promoted to partnership. In addition, firms rarely advertise the number of people who are promoted to counsel positions rather than partnership at the end of the supposed partnership-track period, which is usually a much more commonplace occurrence than making partner. Such statistics and omissions can mislead applicants about their actual chances of becoming an equity or nonequity partner at a firm.

There are many other ways that law firms fudge their employment numbers, and I am not even talking about nonpartnership-track associates, staff attorney roles, and other ways that firms can enlarge their headcount while reducing expenses (I might have to write an article on that in the future!). Nevertheless, law firms undoubtedly do not provide the most accurate picture when they advertise their employment statistics. Perhaps this issue is not as important as the trend of law schools fudging their data years ago, but applicants to law firms and others within the legal profession should recognize that some law firms have misleading employment statistics.

Good news for MoFo associates! Morrison & Foerster has announced that they are getting with the program and raising associate salaries in all U.S. offices, consistent with the new market reality. Everyone pretty much always suspected that the firm would move to the $190,000 scale, after all, they wouldn’t want to show up to recruiting season behind the 8-ball.

The other bit of good news for associates is that the firm is also offering special summer bonuses, as has become the Biglaw trend. Associates in good standing who have met their hours requirement are eligible for the extra money.

The new compensation scale at MoFo is as follows:

# The Female Equity Partner Scorecard: How Do Elite Biglaw Firms Stack Up For Women? (2020)
## Which firms are doing the best, and which firms are doing the worst?

Earlier this month, thanks to the recently released Am Law A-List ranking, we found out which U.S.-centric Biglaw firms were the [best in America](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/the-am-law-a-list-ranking-the-most-elite-law-firms-in-america-2020/) in terms of both finances and culture. As a companion piece to the Am Law A-List, today we’ve got the A-List Female Equity Partner Scorecard, a ranking of the percentage of female equity partners in the Am Law 200.

For this ranking, only equity partners were counted. Because women are often left to languish in the nonequity partner ranks, the Female Equity Scorecard really allows us to see which firms are doing right by the women who work there — and, on the flip side, which firms are being celebrated for doing what looks like the bare minimum.

Without further ado, here are the top 20 to satiate your rankings cravings (with the firms’ total percentage of female equity partners noted parenthetically):

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
1. Fragomen (48.7 percent)
2. Hanson Bridgett (38.8 percent)
3. Marshall Dennehey (32.5 percent)
4. Littler Mendelson (30.6 percent)
5. Jackson Lewis (30.2 percent)
6. Brownstein Hyatt (29.0 percent)
7. Ropes & Gray (28.8. percent)
8. Davis Wright Tremaine (27.6 percent)
9. Morgan Lewis (27.5 percent)
10. Holland & Hart (26.8 percent)
10. Morris Manning (26.8 percent)
10. Porter Wright (26.8 percent)
13. Ballard Spahr (26.6 percent)
14. Manatt (26.3 percent)
14. Sherman & Howard (26.3 percent)
16. Kutak Rock (26.1 percent)
17. Morrison & Foerster (26.0 percent)
17. Munger Tolles (26.0 percent)
19. Covington (25.8 percent)
19. Greenspoon Marder (25.8 percent)

You may be wondering where the rest of the namebrand Biglaw firms appear on this list. We’ve taken the top 20 of the Am Law 100 and listed where they fall on the Female Equity Scorecard so you can see how they really stack up for women.

1. Kirkland / 112. 18.0 percent
2. Latham / 138. 16.1 percent
3. DLA Piper / 158. 14.5 percent
4. Baker McKenzie / 94. 18.9 percent
5. Skadden / 51. 22.3 percent
6. Sidley / provided no data on female equity partners
7. Morgan Lewis / 9. 27.5 percent
8. Hogan Lovells / 53. 22.0 percent
9. White & Case / 140. 16.0 percent
10. Jones Day / 21. 25.4 percent
11. Gibson Dunn / 100. 18.6 percent
12. Norton Rose / 40. 23.3 percent
13. Ropes & Gray / 7. 28.8. percent
14. Greenberg Traurig / 154. 14.8 percent
15. Simpson Thacher / 61. 21.3 percent
16. Weil / 77. 20.2 percent
17. Mayer Brown / 149. 15.2 percent
18. Sullivan & Cromwell / 97. 18.8 percent
19. Davis Polk / 103. 18.4 percent
20. Paul Weiss / 34. 23.8 percent

As you can see, just a handful of the top firms are anywhere near respectable in terms of the promotion of women to their equity partnership ranks. Kudos to Ropes & Gray and Morgan Lewis for placing in the top 10 of each ranking, and a special shout-out to Jones Day; Paul Weiss; and Norton Rose for placing in the top 50 of the Female Equity Scorecard. (We’ll also acknowledge Skadden and Hogan Lovells here for coming so close. Maybe next year?) As for the rest of the firms listed here, this is pretty embarrassing. Your firms are great at making money, and it’s time to open your eyes and see the value of welcoming women into your equity partnership ranks. You can, you should, and you absolutely must do better.

We’re working with a new generation of law firm managing partners and corporate general counsel. This generation has a better understanding of the importance of a diverse workforce. Rather than make this a ‘gotcha’ moment, we need to understand that collaboratively, we can do so much more.

— Robert Grey, president of the Leadership Council on Legal Diversity, commenting on data from the [American Bar Association’s third Model Diversity Survey](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/diversity-inclusion-center/2021-md-survey-2nd-edition.pdf), based on pre-pandemic data. The ABA survey revealed that law firms continue to [hire and promote fewer minority and women lawyers into partnerships](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/white-men-land-firm-partnerships-at-fastest-rates-aba-finds) when compared with white men.

# New Global Law Firm Touts Itself As Big Player... Gives Out Paltry Raises Anyway
## We never expected a complete match, but this is an underwhelming announcement.

When Bryan Cave and Berwin Leighton Paisner [merged earlier this year](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/another-day-another-transatlantic-biglaw-merger-to-create-a-1600-lawyer-megafirm/) to create a global megafirm, most observers expected the newly minted Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner to do two things: (1) make everyone wonder what the hell Berwin ever did to anybody and (2) leverage their new behemoth status to compete more directly with its global peers. And part of competing with the top firms in the world is paying like the top firms in the world, so associate raises were expected across the board.

Bryan Cave historically [paid below the top-of-market figure](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/firms-complex-bonus-structure-providing-most-associates-with-less-than-their-peers/), and it was too much to assume that a merger still in its first year would boost the firm to match the full $190K scale — a move that would require a $30K raise for first-years — but one would have expected a raise announcement placing them in a much better position to compete for top-notch talent. Yet, two months after Milbank pushed the envelope to $190K, BCLP remained silent.

This week, the firm broke its silence and the result was… well, let’s break down how BCLP broke the news:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The international reach of the new combined firm, along with the global cost savings from integration, would allow BCLP to compete globally in many new markets. The firm has been touting this merger as a new era, and has been recruiting top talent to bolster our credentials. So, when an office wide email went out yesterday afternoon announcing an associates meeting the next day, with the banner “ASSOCIATE COMPENSATION MEETING”, we were all excited.

Rookie mistake right there. With some exceptions, you can gauge a firm’s confidence in the raises it’s about to issue based on how they announce it. Here’s the primer:

1. Firm-wide email (Business hours) — You’re so confident that your associates will be overjoyed that you don’t even mind letting them know about their salary during headhunter business hours.

2. Firm-wide email (Afterhours) — The raise is good, but there’s also a stealth increase in billable hour targets or it takes effect next month or there’s no summer bonus. Hopefully, by tomorrow morning the associates will have absorbed everything and come away happy enough to not text Above the Law.

3. Associate Conference Call — There are some problems here, and the partnership wants the opportunity to explain themselves. Hopefully hearing a human voice will quell concerns. And, of course, as long as associates are on the phone, they can’t be talking to other firms about lateraling.

4. Associate Meeting — The peer pressure of having to look at partners while they burst associate bubbles should keep anyone from visibly displaying dismay.

5. Individual Memos — The firm [has contempt for associates as employees](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/jones-days-notorious-black-box-now-starts-at-190k/).

So when they call a meeting, it’s not going to be great news.

And so it wasn’t. The scale for first-year associates in the major BCLP domestic offices will get a $10K bump, moving the scale to $170K. Those in smaller markets will see a $5K raise. But raises for all other classes? Still to be determined. Looks like some firm decided they couldn’t roll into campus interviewing without at least $170K on their factsheet and isn’t worried about what happens next. Oh, and the raises don’t take effect until 2019, underscoring that this move is entirely about telling law students what they’ll be making in the future.

It’s a strategy [we’ve seen before](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/jones-day-cant-even-raise-salaries-without-screwing-someone-over/).

Associates seem less than pleased:

We went into the meeting and were told first years would be getting $10k raises, effective 1/1/19, but all other years it was TBD. How cheap and reckless can you get. I guess they aren’t really trying to get any better. Mediocrity is BCLPs calling card

Another notes:

BCLP coastal offices in the USA will each get $10k raises (going from $160k to $170k). Middle America cities will likely get $5k raises. Raises are effective as of January 1, 2019. No summer bonuses. Nothing in writing yet, no email. This is absolutely pathetic especially given the firm just merged as is 1600 lawyers globally.

Not exactly an auspicious beginning for a firm issuing its first major public facing business decision since merger. There’s a niche to be had for a global firm offering slightly off the elite price point, and maybe BCLP sees that as its proper place. But even in that world, the firm still needs to recruit talent. Attorneys and law students should be able to see through this.

# Biglaw Back To Work: Get Ready For Office Life Come Spring 2021

The novel coronavirus continues its rapid spread across the country, with cases increasing exponentially by the day. It seems that each week, the U.S. sets a record COVID-19 death toll. Hospitals are edging ever closer to being overrun, with some already rationing care for the sick. To say that things do not look good would be an understatement.

Thankfully, two vaccines have been approved for emergency use by the FDA, and they’re being administered across the country in phases. Hopes are pinned on the vaccine’s potential to put an end to the pandemic. With the latest news that judges and lawyers will have priority for vaccination, it makes it seem even more likely that attorneys will soon be able to leave their virtual workspaces to return to their offices.

But just how quickly are law firms planning to step away from remote work and formally reopen their offices? Will you be expected to return to work?

We polled attorneys at nearly 150 Biglaw and boutique law firms from almost every state in America (with our largest respondent cohorts coming from New York and California), as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and Canada to find out what lies ahead for the legal workforce thanks to the pandemic.

Has your firm set a date for the transition away from remote work and the reopening of its office(s)?



An overwhelming majority (83.84%) of respondents reported that their firms had not set a specific date for a transition away from remote work and the reopening of offices. Other firms, however, know generally when they plan to return to work.

When does your firm plan on reopening its office(s)?



The largest cohort of respondents (65.63%) reported that their firm plans to reopen its office(s) in Spring 2021.

What are going to be your firm’s in-office work expectations?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Over half of respondents (54.79%) reported that their firm’s in-office work expectations will include in-office presence at the discretion of the employee.

Have your offices been altered to allow for better social distancing?



Almost half of respondents (48.75%) reported their office has been altered to allow for better social distancing.

What sorts of alterations have been performed?



The largest cohort of respondents (35.25%) reported new signage has been added to their offices. Some of our “other” responses included these alterations: conference room closures; one-way hallways; no shared kitchen equipment; removal of food and beverages; PPE distribution; sanitizing stations; and closed bathroom stalls.

Which of the following best describes your opinion of your firm’s plan:



The largest cohort of respondents (66.94%) reported that they believe their firm’s plan has been just right. This was followed by 10.48% of respondents equally thinking firm plans were slightly rushed and very overcautious.

Are you ready to return to work? We certainly hope so, because it looks like that may be what Biglaw and boutique firms are expecting of their attorneys in just a few months. As with all things having to do with COVID-19, these plans are likely subject to change, but be sure to prepare yourselves for office life once again — just in case.

2017 may be over, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t still stuff to say about it. Law firm financials for 2017 are starting to be released, and [Law.com](https://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2018/02/16/the-early-reports-am-law-100200-2018/) — in anticipation of the annual release of the Am Law rankings — has begun collecting all the juicy tidbits.

One of the most interesting stories in the data so far is all the firms that are recording record-breaking revenue. The industry might be experiencing an [overall malaise](https://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2018/02/16/the-early-reports-am-law-100200-2018/), but the rich — and profitable — law firms [keep getting richer.](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/2018-looks-like-another-year-of-blah-for-the-legal-industry/) Against this backdrop, there are an astonishing nine firms so far that have reported over a billion — yup, with a B — dollars in gross revenue. There’s even one that has posted over $2 billion in revenue for 2017. (This list will continue to grow as Law.com covers more firms.)

There’s little Above the Law readers love more than stories about money, so here, without further ado, are the firms that have reported more than a billion dollars in revenue last year, based on the law firm financials covered to date.

# Oh, To Be A Fly On The Wall At Jones Day As Dissension At The Firm Grows

Jones Day (Photo by David Lat)

The PR machine at Jones Day must really be in overdrive.

Between the [New York Times article](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/even-jones-day-lawyers-are-giving-trumps-election-lawsuits-some-serious-side-eye/), the [attack ads](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/you-have-to-watch-the-opening-salvo-in-the-anti-jones-day-ad-campaign) (plus the [promise of more](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/jones-day-to-prepare-for-a-bad-pr-campaign-the-likes-of-which-theyve-never-seen-before/), and ones that go after the firm’s client base), the [picketing and planned boycotts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/protests-and-boycotts-come-to-jones-days-doorstep/), well, they have a lot to deal with. But so far — publicly at least — the [firm has been resolute](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/) in defending their representation.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But it should be obvious, not everyone at the firm is pleased about it. Today, Kevyn Orr, partner-in-charge at Jones Day’s D.C. office, hosted an associate call to discuss the recent controversy. But apparently after giving his spiel, the call was ended without letting associates register their opinions. Which ticked some folks off.

[Parker Rider-Longmaid](https://www.jonesday.com/en/lawyers/r/parker-riderlongmaid), an associate in the Issues & Appeals practice — and a former clerk to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — was apparently deeply disappointed at Orr’s decision not to answer questions and let fly an email to the entire D.C. office registering that displeasure:

Kevyn, my understanding was that we would have an opportunity at today’s meeting to ask questions or say something. Robin and I had prepared to say something. So now I will share it with all of you this way.

We dissent.

I don’t believe the question here is whether the Pennsylvania election cert petition has legal merit, or is instead frivolous.

I believe the question is whether this firm should lend its prestige and credibility to the project of an administration bent on undermining our democracy and our rule of law.

Make no mistake. From the outset, this petition was designed to suppress the vote, to ensure that fewer of our fellow Americans’ voices would be heard, in the midst of a global pandemic like we have never seen in our lifetimes.

And now, it is being weaponized to threaten our generations-long tradition in this country of peaceful and democratic transition of power.

I believe that our society should strive to become a more just and inclusive representative democracy. And this petition, and the project to which it lends our collective prestige, stands firmly in the way of that ideal.

We as lawyers choose our clients and our causes. We choose what we stand for. And this project, I submit, should not be one of those things.

As an American, I am today deeply disappointed in this firm. I do not accept as simply unpopular what is profoundly undemocratic. We are better than this. And yesterday should be no excuse for tomorrow.

We dissent.

I’m guessing he’s ruing taking t[he firm’s generous SCOTUS bonus right about now…](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/elite-biglaw-firms-are-offering-400k-bonuses-to-supreme-court-clerks/)

According to tipsters at the firm, after this salvo was sent, Orr reopened the meeting and engaged in an extended conversation with associates.

It’s pretty clear that the harm this representation is causing Jones Day goes deeper than those on the outside. Let’s not forget, “Pile On Jones Day” week got started because internal sources at Jones Day that were upset with the firm’s involvement in election litigation [spoke with the New York Times](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/even-jones-day-lawyers-are-giving-trumps-election-lawsuits-some-serious-side-eye/). So we *know* there are people inside the giant Biglaw firm that are upset about… everything the firm’s doing right now. But this is one of the first quasi-public (send something to an entire office and it’s bound to get out) statements anyone from Jones Day has made on the subject, and it comes from an associate.

Thus far, partners at the firm have been conspicuously quiet, though I suspect they aren’t as sanguine behind closed doors. Because if I had a sizable book of business and portable clients and the firm’s pursuit of a pet right-wing legal theory was threatening to unleash this[ PR nightmare on them](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/jones-day-to-prepare-for-a-bad-pr-campaign-the-likes-of-which-theyve-never-seen-before/), well, I’d think long and hard about how to best serve my own clients.

The firm has a lot of explaining to do if they expect to keep all their employees happy during this mess.

# Associates Get Raises, Special Counsel Get The Shaft
## Biglaw's forgotten attorneys aren't enjoying this raise cycle as much as the rest of you.

While Biglaw — and quite a few Small Law — associates celebrate their new raises, senior lawyers across the industry aren’t sharing in the love. Whether a firm calls them “Counsel,” “Senior Counsel,” “Of Counsel,” “Special Counsel,” “Super Duper Counsel,” or “Income Partner,” that class of experienced attorney just a shade outside the ranks of equity partnership tends to fare poorly when raises start going around and this year is no exception.

Compensation among counsel and income partners varies wildly, but we have a reasonable cross-section based on our tipsters.

Simpson Thacher is apparently the exception to the rule when it comes to counsel compensation. From what we’re hearing, it’s not uncommon for counsel to make considerably more than senior associates — in the high $300Ks to low $400Ks base, while also earning the $25K summer bonus. If only the rest of our tips had such a happy ending.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
A smaller firm tipster wrote in to tell us that senior counsel are making $390K, which isn’t necessarily bad, but that it’s frustrating to watch senior associates creep closer and closer while counsel with over a decade of experience have remained mostly locked. As the tipster put it, this doesn’t make any of the counsel feel particularly valued or appreciated. This is the rub when it comes to counsel pay — the firm bends over backward to stay ahead of the associate recruiting curve, but there’s not much of a market for recruiting and retaining counsel. Without that pressure, the only motivation to pay counsel more is the duty to pay them what they deserve and firms have a long history of overlooking such fuzzy moral duties.

The counsel at Mayer Brown are getting an across-the-board bump to keep them in line with the raises coming to associates. Not ahead of senior associates, mind you, but in line with them. Going forward, $340K will be the salary floor for all senior lawyers. And no bonuses. Still, tipsters say the firm’s commitment to providing the absolute bare minimum may stir up a mutiny.

At least the counsel at Gibson Dunn are getting some nominal acknowledgment for their experience. The firm gave modest raises in the $10K range to counsel and kicked in a $25K bonus. This isn’t much, but it does keep them just slightly ahead of the most senior class of associates.

Which is more than can be said for Cahill, where some counsel are making considerably less in base salary than senior associates and also not getting a summer bonus. According to tipsters, a firm memo promised to address counsel pay at the end of the year, but counsel aren’t optimistic.

Katten Muchin Rosenman, in a supplemental memo distributed to Department Heads, Office Managing Partners, Chief Officers and Directors, it was specifically stated that there will be no comp increases to Special Counsel, Of Counsel or Staff Attorneys.

But everyone on this list has a lot to be thankful for when compared to income partners at McGuireWoods. After the most recent round of raises, the income partners there are getting paid commensurate to market 5th years.

Proving yet again that the grass is always browner on the other side.

You’d really think that a law firm partner would know better than to potentially violate anti-discrimination laws in a well attended meeting of a practice group.

Then again, most people don’t really know Jones Day. The firm has built up quite a reputation during the Trump era for aiding and abetting the President, and the firm wasn’t exactly known as a great place for women even before it hitched its wagon to the sexual predator-in-chief.

Still, what went down last week at the [Business and Tort Litigation](https://www.jonesday.com/businessandtortlitigation/) group meeting in Cleveland crosses a line, even for Jones Day.

Sources report that, at the meeting, women in the group were “encouraged” to tell management if they were pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant within the next year. They said that this would help the group plan its budget.

We’re told that partner [Stephen Sozio](https://www.jonesday.com/sgsozio/#), who is co-leader of the firm’s health care practice and chair of the firm’s litigation department in Cleveland, added that he understood if women who were in their first trimester were uncomfortable talking to him. He encouraged those women to contact his administrative assistant and tell her about their plans.

Neither Stephen Sozio or Jones Day responded to multiple requests for comment.

You don’t need to be an Ohio employment lawyer to know that you shouldn’t be asking your employees if they’re pregnant or plan to become pregnant. But, since it’s not entirely clear that there are still partners at Jones Day who know that there are laws and things, here are some words from the [Ohio Employment Lawyers Association](http://www.employeerights.info/2/oelasmart/pregnancy-discrimination#4):

Do I have to tell potential employers I’m pregnant?

An employer cannot refuse to hire you because of your pregnancy-related condition as long as you are able to perform the major functions of your job. An employer cannot refuse to hire you because of its own prejudices against pregnant workers or the prejudices of co-workers, clients or customers. Therefore, an employer cannot ask you if you are pregnant or plan to have children.

If you are still early on in your pregnancy and not showing, you may choose to keep that information to yourself. Even if you volunteer the information or the employer is otherwise aware that you are pregnant, however, an employer cannot legally make hiring decisions based upon that information, but you should also recognize that it could be very difficult to prove that the reason you were not hired was because of your pregnancy.

Do I have to tell my current employer I’m pregnant?

A pregnancy will eventually start to show, so you may want to notify your employer that you’re pregnant as you approach that point. Prior to that point, if you do not require or anticipate any kind of leave for medical visits or pregnancy-related sickness, and are otherwise able to perform the major functions of your job, you may choose not to share that information with your employer.

You may need to notify your employer if you are going to take leave. You can consult with your supervisor, human resources department, company handbook, or your union to determine your company’s policies about using sick leave, short-term disability leave, or FMLA leave (if you are eligible). Each type of leave may have different advance notification requirements that you may be required to follow. If advance notification is required in order to utilize leave, you should comply with the notification requirements even though it requires you to disclose your pregnancy.

Discrimination of the basis of pregnancy is also covered as a federal matter by the Civil Rights Act. And, as of this writing, former and future Jones Day partner Don McGahn has not yet successfully packed the Supreme Court with people who will overturn the Civil Rights Act.

None of the Jones Day women we spoke with took the opportunity to help Sozio out with his budget. But one hopes that the firm has budgeted for liability insurance, for the day when Jones Day women have had enough.

The Biglaw price tag is not for the faint of heart. For [a while now](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/the-biglaw-firms-with-the-highest-partner-billing-rates/), the rates for the best Biglaw partners have been over $1,000 an hour, with the [top rates](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/the-biglaw-firms-with-the-highest-partner-billing-rates/) at the $2,000 mark. It’s enough to give anyone [sticker shock](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/yes-this-is-how-much-a-biglaw-partner-working-for-one-week-bills/).

But the truth is, it has become increasingly common to have the partners on big cases or deals billing at four-figure rates. The new hotness, as bankruptcy filings have revealed, is charging north of $1,000 for associates.

So, that’s what (senior) associates are really worth at top law firms.

According [to Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/05/22/associate-billing-rates-surpass-1k-as-firms-snap-up-bankruptcy-work/), at least three Biglaw firms have crossed that rubicon. Kirkland & Ellis associates bill up to $1,125 per hour, as disclosed in the Biglaw giant’s work in the Barney’s New York bankruptcy. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom revealed their $1,000+ associate price tag in the McClatchy newspaper bankruptcy. And in the J. Crew bankruptcy filings, Weil, Gotshal & Manges disclosed associate billing rates in the range of $595 to $1,050.

And you know if these three firms are charging $1,000+ for associates, so are other elite firms.

I guess an unexpected silver lining (albeit a small one) of the rash of bankruptcies we are seeing (and expect to see) is casting more light on the realities of Biglaw billing rates.

# Law Firms Should Not Use Secretaries To Monitor Attorneys
## This seems like a wasteful practice.

As many law firms force attorneys and staff back to offices, numerous shops are employing methods to ensure that attorneys are following return-to-the-office policies. Some law firms are holding mandatory meetings so that partners can see who shows up on a given day. This seems like a wasteful practice since such meetings often have little value other than determining who was in the office on a given day (so I’m told). I have also heard recently that some law firms are tasking secretaries and other administrative professionals with monitoring attorneys so that work-from-office policies are followed.

Using secretaries to keep tabs on associates is nothing new, and I was aware of this phenomenon since the beginning of my legal career. About a decade ago, I worked at a Biglaw shop in an office that had numerous lawyers and staffers. People had relatively free reign to come and go as they pleased, which was important since numerous attorneys needed to attend depositions, court appearances, and other off-site functions. However, it was a habit of some attorneys to not be in the office even though they did not record this time as paid time off. That firm let people bank their PTO, and also paid attorneys for four weeks of PTO when they left the firm, so the firm had a vested interest in knowing whether an attorney was recording time as PTO.

In any case, one time, I passed by a secretary who had a strange spreadsheet up on her computer. The spreadsheet had all of the attorneys for whom the secretary did work. I asked about the strange spreadsheet, and the secretary told me in a hushed tone that secretaries at that firm were tasked with recording which attorneys were in the office each day. If an attorney was not in the office, and had not recorded the time as PTO, there might be some follow up to determine whether the time should have been recorded as PTO.

I did not like a few things about this policy. Perhaps most importantly, the firm was not being open and honest with people who worked at this shop. It is clear that the firm wanted to keep this policy under wraps since it would be easier for attorneys to game the system if they knew that secretaries were keeping tabs on them. I generally believe that sunshine is the best disinfectant (which is a quote by the namesake of my alma mater!) and that law firms cannot build trust with the people who work for them if they are not transparent with those people. To build more trust, law firms should not try to keep surreptitious monitoring from associates and should be up front with their employees.

Also, using secretaries to monitor associates can impact the team mentality of a law firm. In order for law firms to be most effective, all of the professionals who work at a shop need to rely on each other. Each person on a legal team has a given role that they can perform best, and legal professionals need to rely on each other in order to best serve clients. People might hold a grudge against people who are surreptitiously monitoring them and might not be as confident in their teammates if the law firm for which they work is creating an “us versus them” mentality.

Ideally, law firms would just have a relaxed approach to office time, and then shops would not need to keep tabs on attorneys who show up to an office. However, law firms can take other approaches if they insist on keeping tabs on associates and whether lawyers show up to an office. Perhaps the easiest way for law firms to keep tabs on attorneys is just to have a partner walk the halls of an office and see who is at a shop on a given day. If partners are not showing up to an office so that they cannot perform this function, it would be unfair to expect other attorneys at a firm to be at the office. Since there is already a supervisory aspect to the associate-partner relationship, having partners keep tabs on associates should not impact the team dynamic between associates and secretaries.

Being a law firm secretary is hard enough without partners tasking secretaries with policing work-from-the-office policies. Accordingly, partners should either assume the responsibility of monitoring associates or drop such policies altogether.

# Standard Of Review: A Notable New Novel About Biglaw

[](http://amzn.to/2io4GAn)Lawyers can often be long-winded. There have been numerous instances in which I have read legal briefs or novels by attorneys that repeat the same point over and over. The new novel [Big Law](http://amzn.to/2jbsM2p) by lawyer Ron Liebman surprisingly has the opposite problem: the book is relatively short, and plot points and character motivations are frequently given short shrift.

The book centers around Carney Blake, a junior litigation partner at behemoth law firm Dunn & Sullivan, a thinly veiled combination of Gibson Dunn and Sullivan & Cromwell. Carney is called into the office of Carl Smith, the chairman of Dunn & Sullivan, who secretly has his eye on taking the firm public via an IPO. In order to do this, Carl has taken several plaintiff-side cases on a contingency basis to make the firm’s potential profits seem higher than they actually are.

The case assigned to Carney is on behalf of workers of a gas plant in India owned by GRE, an American conglomerate. GRE did not evacuate workers with sufficient speed after the gas plant blew, and many workers died or suffered serious injuries. An Indian attorney initially brought an action against GRE in India and attained a $2.5 billion judgment. Carl enlists Carney to represent the workers in actions seeking to attach GRE’s U.S.-based assets. GRE is represented by Peter Mason, a former Dunn & Sullivan associate who was pushed out of the firm by Carl and wants revenge. Unbeknownst to Carney and Carl, Peter paid the Indian attorney under the table to hire Dunn & Sullivan; Peter accuses Dunn & Sullivan – including Carney – of taking the case despite the fact that it knew that the Indian judgment was procured by fraud (such as bribing the judge). Carney is one of Peter’s targets and soon finds himself facing potential civil and criminal liability.

Ron Liebman

Liebman is a former partner at Patton Boggs, and he also previously worked as an assistant U.S. attorney and as a clerk for a district court judge, so he understands the demanding life that attorneys in Biglaw face. Liebman describes how Carney has to make myriad personal sacrifices for his job, such as working on Thanksgiving or going back to work after attending a dinner with his girlfriend and brother. Carney also has a difficult family life; his father is a stubborn alcoholic, and his brother turns to drugs after struggling with PTSD. The passages regarding Carney’s father – and the disconnect between his father’s gregarious nature at his day job and his alcoholic nature at night – are particularly compelling. Further, the book is written as if it is Carney’s memoir delivered directly to the reader. As a result, the narrative is very conversational, including rhetorical questions and asides, which provides the book with a strong voice.

But, as mentioned above, Big Law is one of those rare books that probably should have been longer, rather than shorter. For example, the only explanation for Peter’s plan is pure revenge, but Liebman does not provide sufficient background on Peter so that the reader properly understands why despite being extremely successful in his own right, Peter would risk his professional life to perpetrate such an exceedingly risky plot.

There are also a few subplots that could have either been expanded or cut. One particularly unpopular Dunn & Sullivan lawyer feuds with Carney and later Carl, and his tenure at Dunn & Sullivan ends with shocking violence. And Carl is engaged in a bitter divorce with his wife. These subplots did not really add much to Carl’s character and were mostly distracting.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The legal aspects of the plot also need to be beefed up. Given the high bar for fraud (including the protections of Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules), Liebman should have provided more explanation for how Peter was so easily able to perpetrate his plan and accuse Dunn & Sullivan of wrongdoing. Furthermore, the trial that ends the novel is anti-climactic and extremely rushed; I have no idea why the jury came to the conclusion it reached.

Carney is a surprisingly mediocre attorney. At one point, a fourth-year associate needs to prompt Carney to speak up in court after Peter accuses Dunn & Sullivan of fraud. In another instance, Carney does not realize that he should file a motion pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules until his mentor tells him to, despite it being blindingly obvious (at least to me) that this was the proper course of action.

Given that Liebman is such an accomplished attorney, I counted a surprisingly high number of mistakes. After Carney files his complaint, he refers to the document subsequently filed by Peter as a “pleading,” including allegations made upon information and belief, but then refers to the same document as a motion to dismiss (without mentioning a counterclaim). He states that Peter engaged in gamesmanship by filing the “pleading” with the federal court “literally minutes before its clerk’s office closed for the day,” but ignores how nowadays documents are typically filed electronically up until midnight. Carney and Peter appear in front of the judge for a status conference but Carney states that he “didn’t realize” that Peter had requested the conference; such an ex parte communication requesting a court conference is extremely far-fetched. And, of course, it would be impossible for Dunn & Sullivan to go public given the prohibitions on non-lawyer ownership of law firms in the U.S. These may seem like nitpicks, but they really add up.

Big Law has some merit, but readers might want to choose other, better books about big law, such as the similarly titled [BIGLAW](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/standard-of-review-biglaw-will-give-readers-anxiety-in-a-good-way/) by Lindsay Cameron.

# Will All Of This Bonus Money Be Enough To Keep Associates From Making Lateral Moves?

While offering some of these bonuses is great and it demonstrates an appreciation from the firm that you’re with, whether or not in the long term it’s going to be helpful for retention I think is yet to be seen. They need [associates] more than ever and so being proactive in keeping them happy, when they’re billing as much as they’re billing … it is one of the tools that they have right now to retain the talent that they have while also trying to recruit new talent.

Hugh Verrier [will step down as chair](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/law-firm-white-case-taps-new-york-litigator-new-chair-2023-06-27/) of White & Case at the end of the summer, to be replaced by litigator Heather McDevitt.

Verrier has led White & Case for 16 years and overseen as boom in the firm’s fortunes. The firm ranks in the top 10 in the Am Law 100, G200, and NLJ 500. The $2.8B revenue firm boasts $2.8M in PEP and revenue per lawyer numbers of $1,081,000.

McDevitt said: “It is a great honor to be elected by my fellow partners as Chair of White & Case. I look forward to working with our talented and dedicated partners and colleagues across the globe to ensure our Firm continues to provide exceptional service to our clients. Building upon the success that has defined our journey under Hugh’s leadership, I am dedicated to the continued growth of our Firm in the years to come.”

[](http://bit.ly/2QV14GY)Upgrading your practice’s financial software can feel like trying to change a flat tire while driving on the highway: at best, it will slow down your forward movement and it might even lead to a disastrous crash. In today’s technology driven landscape,staying up-to-date on the most current solutions – particularly those that help streamline your financial platforms – is the key to maintaining your competitive edge as a law firm. But [transitioning your firm](http://bit.ly/2QV14GY) isn’t without its challenges. What tech should you use? What are the first steps you should take? How do you integrate new software without halting your firm to a standstill? How do you maintain your revenue, clients, and sanity during the process?

Balancing technology innovation with profitability and productivity is one of the biggest challenges law firm leaders face. And when it comes to your financial software in particular, it’s not a challenge you can afford to fumble.  Fortunately, Thomson Reuters has the answer. In the new whitepaper, “[Five Ways Transitional Products Can Enhance Your Enterprise Software](http://bit.ly/2QV14GY),” Thomson Reuters shows you how to evaluate the technology roadmap for your financial software and why its transitional product packages are your best bet for driving efficiency and enabling insights during a technology transition. 

In this [white paper](http://bit.ly/2QV14GY) you will learn just what the Thomson Reuters transitional product packages encompass, why these packages are the best way to avoid slowing your teams down during a technology update, and why you shouldn’t wait any longer to invest in a smoother, more productive path for your firm.

# How Did Stroock Fail With Cringeworthy Advertising Like This?
## Were you ever 'awe-Stroock' by Stroock & Stroock?

After failing to secure a merger partner  — not [once](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/biglaw-merger-effort-crumbles/), but [twice](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/yet-another-firm-ends-merger-talks-with-stroock/) since the summer — and then [losing half its partnership to Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/the-end-may-be-near-as-stroock-loses-more-than-half-its-partners-to-hogan-lovells/), Stroock & Stroock & Don’t-Forget-Lavan will soon close its doors after 147 years.

It’s quite a fall for a firm that ranked in the inaugural Am Law 50 (how high did they rank back then? [Find out here!](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/how-the-mighty-have-fallen/)). How did the firm slip from the top of Biglaw? Especially when they were able to lure the best talent with finger-on-the-pulse advertising like this:



No font conveys a vibrant, forward-thinking outlook better than Goudy Handtooled. Obviously this ad dates back a couple decades, but I can assure readers that, if anything, “hip” and “awe-Stroock” played worse back then. Someone looked at a draft of this, saw “awe-Stroock” and thought, “I worry this might be too subtle… best to change the color.”

Great job, Stroock.

# You *Have* To Watch The Opening Salvo In The Anti-Jones Day Ad Campaign

Jones Day (Photo by David Lat)

The attention is just being heaped on Jones Day right now. And not in a good way.

There was the New York Times [article blowing them up](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/even-jones-day-lawyers-are-giving-trumps-election-lawsuits-some-serious-side-eye/) over their election litigation, and their erm, [response to the controversy](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/) left something to be desired. Plus the Lincoln Project promised to spend $500,000 on [an ad campaign](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/jones-day-to-prepare-for-a-bad-pr-campaign-the-likes-of-which-theyve-never-seen-before/) going after them — and, importantly, their clients — for “attempting to undermine the outcome of a just and fair election.” But it looks like Lincoln Project wasn’t the only PAC to notice Jones Day’s recent representation.

Enter [MeidasTouch](https://www.meidastouch.com/), self-described as “a progressive, next-generation SuperPAC staffed solely by three siblings (and lifelong Democrats) with the primary goal of defeating Donald Trump in 2020.” The PAC was formed during COVID-19 quarantine, and one of the three brothers at the helm of the organization is [Ben Meiselas](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/Ben-Meiselas/), partner at [Geragos & Geragos](https://www.geragos.com/attorney-profiles/ben-meiselas) and head of their transactional and civil practice (who has represented Colin Kaepernick). No wonder the antics of Jones Day caught their eye.

Anyway, this is a biting look at the work of Jones Day. Clients, law students, and laterals take note.

I will say that we were able to transform the workplace overnight when it came to the coronavirus. We can do the same thing when it comes to racism. We have to have the will to do it.

— Legal consultant [Michelle Silverthorn](https://michellesilverthorn.com/), founder and CEO of Inclusion Nation, commenting on the fact that law firms are surely able to [bring on and elevate more Black attorneys](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/25/despite-all-that-happened-last-year-many-law-firms-still-have-no-black-partners/), if they’re truly interested in doing so. The following firms listed on the American Lawyer’s 2021 Diversity Scorecard currently do not have any Black partners: Berry Appleman & Leiden; Wood Smith Henning & Berman; Kobre & Kim; Knobbe Martens; Greenspoon Marder; Snell & Wilmer; McAfee &; Taft; SmithAmundsen; Day Pitney; Cole Schotz; Goulston & Storrs; Fennemore Craig; Von; Briesen & Roper; Morris, Manning & Martin; Irell & Manella.

# Sullivan & Cromwell Goes In A New Direction With Leadership Appointment
## Two new leaders at S&C.

Sullivan & Cromwell is getting a new chair of the firm. Strike that. Two new co-chairs. For the first time in the Biglaw firm’s history, instead of one lawyer leading the firm, they’ll have a pair doing it together. Litigator Robert Giuffra and corporate attorney Scott Miller will be sharing the duties, taking over from Joseph Shenker who held the chair position since 2010.

As [reported by](https://www.wsj.com/articles/law-firm-sullivan-cromwell-taps-new-leadership-11641214872) Wall Street Journal, the first priority for the leadership is navigating the veritable minefield of the COVID pandemic:

Guiding the 900-lawyer firm through the rest of the coronavirus pandemic will be one of the pair’s first challenges, Mr. Miller said. The firm has seen more lawyers return to the office this year than many of its peers, he said, helped in part by Sullivan & Cromwell owning its building in lower Manhattan, which gives it more real estate to use to space people out.

Law firms have traditionally stressed the importance of working side-by-side as the best way to train the next generation. Mr. Miller said he is focused on “how you instill a culture while allowing people a little bit of freedom to work in a nonoffice environment at least some of the time.”

And for a prestigious — and old school — firm like S&C, that means doing what they do best, as Giuffra noted, “We’re not much for some of the fads you see in the legal market, people suddenly changing things year to year.” What is new at the firm is having a litigator in the (co) chair role; Giuffra is the first to do so in the firm’s 140+ year history.

In 2020, S&C made $1,555,441,000 in gross revenue, making it 18th on the Am Law 100. The new firm leaders say 2021 was even better financially for the firm, with revenue and profits rising by a double-digit percentage.

Best of luck to Giuffra and Miller in their new roles.

There are myriad reasons why a legal CRM system is essential to today’s law firm.

For example, today’s social media not only is
a forum for the general public’s criticism or praise for lawyers, these platforms have
also become more popular for potential
clients to seek solutions to problems.

Salesforce Legal CRM is here to help with these types of evolving challenges.

In this free white paper, our friends at Matterly detail what a cloud-based system can do for your firm. Download it to learn:

- Why lawyers are switching to a Salesforce legal CRM
- Why law firms must embrace data and analytics
- How you can provide clients with the information they need quickly
And there’s more! Matterly is available for a 30-day free trial, and no credit card is required. [Click here](https://matterly.io/contact/) to sign up for a free look at what Matterly can do for your firm.

# Elite Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries For (Some) Associates After Raking In Big Bucks In 2020
## Wow! Could this be the start of a new salary movement?

Biglaw has done well — really, really well — in spite of the ongoing pandemic. In fact, the largest law firms in America have done so well that some associates have started to wonder whether salary increases could be in their futures. The last time this happened was in 2018, when the majority of Biglaw firms increased their base pay for associates to $190K.

Today, it looks like raises are on the horizon for associates working for at least one firm, but will others follow in this firm’s footsteps?

Back in June 2018, Am Law’s #3 firm DLA Piper — which brought in $3,112,130,000 gross revenue in 2019 — matched the prevailing market rate salaries for [all of its major offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/but-will-associates-in-the-mutara-nebula-get-a-cut-of-these-raises/). Here’s the salary scale:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
1st Year: $190,000
2nd Year: $200,000
3rd Year: $220,000
4th Year: $255,000
5th Year: $280,000
6th Year: $305,000
7th Year: $325,000
8th Year: $340,000

According to global co-chair Frank Ryan, the firm reportedly increased its revenue over the course of 2020, and now it’s literally sharing the wealth with associates outside of major markets. (This is probably a good way for the firm to make up for [skipping out](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/dla-piper-bonuses-2020/) on associate appreciation bonuses.) In a memo sent earlier this week (available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/dla-piper-2021-salary-raise/2)), Beth Connor, DLA Piper’s director of lawyer compensation, said, “We believe that this step best reflects who we are as one of the leading national law firms, and the support that all of our associates, regardless of geography, have continued to provide to our clients over the past year.” Way to go, DLA Piper. It’s about time the firm caught up with its competition on salaries.

Congratulations to everyone at DLA Piper who just got a big raise. Your bank accounts will be stuffed come March 26.

What does this mean for the rest of Biglaw? Will other firms decide to open up their coffers to share some of 2020’s bounty for all of their associates’ hard work? This could be the start of something HUGE.

As we enter the home stretch to make billable hour targets in advance of bonus season, one firm is changing the ground rules on its associates and robbing them of a small but significant chunk of time that they’ve always been able to count toward their 2100 hour minimum.

In an email sent to all associates last week, Quinn Emanuel announced that it would — beginning November 30 — change its guidelines for non-billable hours that can count toward the bonus target by removing travel time from the equation entirely. Up until now, associates could seek approval for travel time to count toward the 2100-hour minimum as part of a 100-hour cap for approved non-billable work. Starting soon, that bucket will only include pro bono, AAIT (Additional Associate In Trial), recruiting and interviewing, and client pitches.

This isn’t the first time Quinn Emanuel’s taken steps to get more work out of associates than they’re willing to compensate them for. Back in 2015, the firm instituted a policy requiring all associates to do a “[marketing project](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/top-law-firm-withholding-bonuses-unless-associates-do-a-marketing-project/)” that would explicitly not count toward their 100-hour non-billable component. The firm even went so far as to say that associates wouldn’t even be eligible for a bonus if they haven’t performed this extra public relations work for the firm. After we covered this development, John Quinn outlined his belief that [lawyers need to learn good marketing practices](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/quinn-emanuels-new-marketing-initiative-an-interview-with-john-quinn/), which was all well and good but didn’t address the original criticism that the firm penalized attorneys for not taking on extra work rather than incentivizing them to broaden their horizons.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Now yet another professional necessity is being carved out of the already tight 100-hour non-billable cap. But this one does raise an interesting philosophical question. Lawyers used to routinely bill travel time. As the logic went, if the lawyer ran out of other client work to bill on the flight, then they would have been home but for the trip required for the client and that would be billable. But somewhere along the way, billing for travel time became taboo. To some extent this was a fair development — it never seemed right that the associates on transatlantic deals always hit targets before anyone else by sheer luck of the draw.

But this policy seems to go too far the other direction. Now the associate on the international arbitration is being penalized by the luck of the draw. Some clients, no doubt, still pay for travel time and that would presumably be counted as billable time, but many don’t anymore and now these high-flying associates can’t even get credit for the hours they’re giving to the firm. Perhaps everyone was maxing out their 100-hour cap with pro bono work anyway — which would be noble — but if there’s any risk someone spent a year in limbo at 30,000 feet and needed some extra time to make 2100 hours, the firm should continue to let them count it.

In the ongoing struggle between clients and outside counsel to manage costs, it’s an interesting philosophical question whether the client or the firm should bear the cost of the time spent up in the air.

On the other hand, it’s hard to say that the associate should be the one taking that hit.

You really can set your watch to it.

On Monday, Sean Spicer declared that Marc Kasowitz had the [full confidence](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/spicer-confirms-president-stands-with-kasowitz-start-the-countdown-to-his-firing/) of Donald Trump. Cue some negative media coverage, and Kasowitz is out. It happens every damn time Spicer expresses the president’s vote of confidence.

Sean Spicer is the little girl from The Ring.

CBS’s Major Garrett put out the news over night:

News: Marc Kasowitz out as [@POTUS](https://twitter.com/POTUS) attorney – legal team now Cobb, Sekulow & Dowd. Sounds like a law firm but is not. Corrallo has resigned.

— Major Garrett (@MajorCBS) [July 21, 2017](https://twitter.com/MajorCBS/status/888237148830404608)

But Maggie Haberman of the New York Times disagrees slightly:

Kasowitz is out in same way Gorelick is out – ie not gone but lesser role.

— Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) [July 21, 2017](https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/888243283406860289)

That strikes me as a distinction without difference. With the massive spotlight on this matter, no one was really going to make a clean break. Kasowitz will return to his day-to-day activities at the offices of Kasowitz Benson, [outside of lunch and dinner](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/kasowitz-p-r-guy-describes-himself-as-mob-fixer-in-official-bio/), and never show up in this case again except as a blip at the bottom of a press release identifying him as part of Trump’s “extended legal team.” He’s gone.

Whether Kasowitz left entirely of his own accord is unknown, but rumors had circulated that both sides were itching to end the engagement, and the simultaneous resignation of legal team spokesperson Mark Corallo suggests someone didn’t like the fundamental structure of the team. Regardless of how he ended up on the outs, this is the best thing that could have happened to Kasowitz. Taking on this lost cause of a defense exposed him to an [ethics complaint](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/and-now-the-inevitable-ethics-complaint-against-trumps-lawyer/), [a scathing investigative report](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-is-waking-up-to-a-bad-morning/), and an [embarrassing public squabble with a critic](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-writes-angry-emails-and-everyone-completely-overreacts/). All against a backdrop of chatter that his firm was in trouble. Now he can move on.

That’s Jay Sekulow’s music, everybody. And it [sounds like bad classic rock](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/why-does-every-republican-lawyer-have-a-terrible-rock-band/). Sekulow’s [quasi-lawyerly sideshow](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/jay-sekulow-masterful-showman-or-terrible-attorney/) can now take full ownership of this trainwreck. Sure, [Ty Cobb](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/the-incredible-growing-presidential-legal-team/) recently joined the legal team, but he’s not going to last once Trump figures out he’s not a [Hall of Famer who hates Jews](http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/167514/mlb-ty-cobb-baseball). And John Dowd is one photo shoot away from making Kasowitz’s “watch your back, bitch” look like a Hallmark card. Just a reminder of his professionalism hit parade:

Good night, sweet prince. You taught us all to watch our backs, and we’ll never forget you for it.

# Biglaw Firm Refuses To Invite Associates To Its Holiday Party
## These associates seem pretty pissed.

The saddest Biglaw celebration ever?

It’s almost mid-December, which means Biglaw holiday parties are beginning to get into full swing. These impressive fêtes usually feature an abundance of free-flowing alcohol and fabulous food, which sometimes comes courtesy of some of the world’s most renowned chefs. What should you wear? What should you drink? And how much of your preferred drink is appropriate to consume at a firm-sponsored event?

Associates at one Biglaw firm won’t have to worry about the answers to those questions, because for the second year in a row, they haven’t been invited to attend their firm’s holiday party. Which firm could it be? For the answer, we turn to an angry source:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
My firm, Lewis Brisbois LLP, is not inviting associates to its NYC holiday party for the second year in a row! For the past several years, it has been held at Delmonico’s in the Financial District, and it’s been a pretty great affair. Last year, the NYC managing partner sent a quasi-apologetic email stating that he was sorry and it would not happen again. Guess what? The firm cheaped out again and booked the same venue, and again has not invited any associates to attend.

The firm continues to invite other partners from around the country and their clients, instead of the NY associates who are based here. It’s pretty absurd for a firm of our size, and the associates were pissed last year, and probably will be again this year.

Another tipster remarked that “no courtesies are being forwarded to the associates,” and told us that this may be a national trend for Lewis Brisbois, with offices around the country refusing to invite associates to attend the firm’s local holiday parties.

Why wouldn’t this firm invite associates to its holiday party? Coming in at No. 77 on the most recent [Am Law 100 rankings](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755653526), Lewis Brisbois can certainly afford to extend invitations to those who are billing for the firm around the clock, so is this actually a problem with associates’ behavior? We’ve reached out to the firm for comment, but have not yet received a response. If and when we do, we will update this post.

For the time being, Lewis Brisbois associates may be better off sitting back and biding their time with their billables instead of partying. We’ve yet to hear from the firm about its bonuses, so the time is now to get those final hours in for a strong showing in 2016.

The latest firm to announce raises and bonuses for hardworking associates is Mayer Brown. The firm, ranked #12 in the nation, made $1,858,000,000 gross revenue in 2022, so it isn’t shocking they’re spreading the wealth with associates.

Here’s the grid — for the New York office — at Mayer Brown:



Above the Law is still waiting to hear from tipsters at the firm’s other U.S. offices — including Mayer Brown’s flagship office in Chicago. Historically those offices have fared [as well or better than NY](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/mayer-brown-bonus-2022/), so we doubt they’ll be left out in the cold.

UPDATE: insiders have confirmed, as suspected, the raises are for all U.S. offices. The compensation and bonus grid for the non-NY offices is as follows:



Read the NY full memo below. The memo for the other offices[ is here.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firm-spreading-big-money-to-associates/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Name Partner Recognized As Legend Of The Antitrust Bar Passes Away

We have some sad news to report out of the New York legal community, where one of the founding partners of a high-powered Biglaw firm recently passed away. [Donald Flexner](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/donald-l-flexner.html), 81, made his mark upon the world of antitrust law through his litigation and counseling efforts at Crowell & Moring and Boies Schiller Flexner.

A graduate of NYU Law, Flexner spent some time working at the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, where he eventually became section chief and deputy assistant attorney general. He later joined Crowell & Moring, where he spent 19 years in charge of the firm’s antitrust group. He then took his extensive antitrust chops to Boies Schiller Flexner, where he spent the rest of his career, helping build up the once small firm to become an Am Law 200 litigation powerhouse. Flexner stepped down as the firm’s co-managing partner in 2017 but decided to stay on as a partner.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
From breaking up the Bell System monopoly to helping to create the world’s largest airline through his work overseeing Delta’s acquisition of Northwest Airlines, Flexner is easily recognized as a true titan of the antitrust bar. David Boies shared kind words about his longtime partner with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/03/14/donald-flexner-antitrust-titan-of-boies-schiller-flexner-dies-at-81/) back in 2017, when Flexner won the magazine’s Lifetime Achiever award. “Lawyers are not always the most liked people in the room,” he said, “but I don’t know anybody that doesn’t like and admire Don Flexner.”

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences to Donald Flexner’s family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.

# Attention Law Students: First-Year Associate Hiring Set To Increase At Law Firms
## Maybe you don't need to be so worried about finding a job after all!

‘Woohoo, I got a job!’

On a scale of “¯\_(ツ)_/¯” to “holy hell, I’ll never be able to pay off all these loans,” how worried are you about finding a job after graduation? Maybe you don’t need to be quite so apprehensive, because according to a new survey, first-year hiring is about to pick up at law firms across the country, both big and small.

Robert Half Legal conducted telephone interviews of lawyers with law firms in the United States and Canada, and after speaking with 175 respondents with hiring authority within their firm, discovered that nearly a quarter of them (22 percent) intended to increase hiring of first-year associates next year.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Here’s some additional information from the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202798556061/FirstYear-Associate-Jobs-Set-For-Slight-Rise-Survey-Finds?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=8):

In a sign of overall confidence across the industry, two-thirds of lawyers said that their firms hiring plans for the next 12 months were unchanged, despite challenging market conditions, while just 7 percent of lawyers said their firm would decrease the number of spaces for first-year associates.

Robert Half executive director Jamy Sullivan said that firms are looking to staff up in high-growth practice areas such as litigation, commercial law and real estate. …

The results broadly coincide with those of a report released earlier this summer by Citi Private Bank, which found an overall rise in confidence among U.S. law firm leaders and a likelihood of increased associate roles across the market.


(Table via Robert Half Legal)

While two percent of firms want to increase their first-year hiring “significantly,” we’re a little concerned that seven percent of firms will either be decreasing their first-year hiring “somewhat” or “significantly” within the next 12 months. Perhaps they know something about future market conditions for the legal industry that the rest of us don’t.

With that cautionary note having been sounded, who are the law students most likely to be hired? Sullivan said that “[n]ew associates who were ranked at the top of their law school class and possess in-demand attributes such as technology proficiency, business acumen, interpersonal abilities and team collaboration skills are highly marketable.”

Best of luck out there, law students! We hope that you’ll be able to find your dream job now that opportunities are increasing.

# Associate Compensation Scorecard: Biglaw’s 2021 Bonus Blowout
## Is your firm listed here? If not, what are the partners waiting for?

Since we broke the news of the market bonus scale for associates at large law firms in the United States — a trend [started by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/) on Monday, November 22, 2021 — several firms quickly fell in line and matched the scale. The rest were waiting for another firm to enter the scene (ahem, Davis Polk) and announce even bigger, better bonuses. That finally happened on December 6, when DPW announced [a round of special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/).

When will your firm announce its bonuses?

As usual, we are compiling a table of all the firms that have already matched the new bonus scale, whether special bonuses are or were included, the minimum hours required to receive those bonuses (if available), and the date those bonuses will be paid. Today, we unveil that table for your viewing pleasure. We will update this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as firm’s announce bonus news. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs clarification, [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Bonus%20Scorecard%20Correction).

Help us help you now (and if/when you decide to make a lateral move in the future). Let us know what your firm’s minimum billable hours targets are for bonus eligibility and when your firm will pay those bonuses. You generally must remain at your firm until the payout date to receive them, as stated in most memos, which could make it all the more difficult for you to leave your place of employment.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus season, everyone!

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm To Offer Associates 2 Remote Days Each Week
## But perhaps thanks to Morgan Stanley, partners are expected to have a strong in-office presence.

August is nearly upon is, and that means we’re getting closer and closer not just to the end of the summer, but the date when lawyers at many firms are expected to return to the office in person. Some firms are going forward with a hybrid model, meaning that employee time will be split between the office and their homes (or the remote location of their choice).

Weil Gotshal is one of those firms. As noted in a [memo sent to all employees in May](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/weil-reopening/), the firm’s New York, Boston, D.C., Miami, Dallas, and Houston offices opened at 100 percent capacity in June (with the Silicon Valley office opening at 100 percent capacity on June 15th), the firm will be fully back to business on September 7.

Last week, in an email sent to all US partners by [Mindy Spector](https://www.weil.com/people/mindy-spector), the firm’s GC, Weil’s remote policy was fleshed out in a little more detail.  Here’s a relevant excerpt from that memo:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The US Work From Home Policy permits all lawyers and staff to work remotely on Fridays, and for attorneys to work remotely one additional day per week. Of course, client needs may interfere from time to time. The designation of Friday as a remote work day was to provide some degree of certainty and planning.

Spector also notes that “every attorney – including partners – is expected to be working from their Weil pre-pandemic home office.” It looks like it’s time to head on back to the home you knew before COVID-19 took over the world and sent lawyers to remote work environments for more than a year.

Further down in the memo is a rather curious sentence in the wake of Morgan Stanley chief legal officer Eric Grossman’s veiled [return-to-office ultimatum for outside counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/we-need-all-lawyers-in-the-office-says-bank-definitely-not-freaking-out-about-commercial-real-estate-portfolio/) (“I strongly believe that firms that return to the office will have a significant performance advantage over those that do not.”), followed by a firm suggestion for partners.

Clients are indicating that law firms with significant in person presence will have an advantage over those that are permitting extensive remote working. The Management Committee expects Partners to have a significant in office presence.

It looks like at least one firm has taken Morgan Stanley’s message to heart.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Partner Opens Up About Depression And How Firms Can Do Better

Lawyers know that there’s a mental health crisis bubbling under the surface of the industry. We just don’t do much to get on top of it. Our statistics are [all bad](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/03/the-legal-industrys-mental-health-problem-grew-in-2020-our-survey-shows/), which is even worse news when you consider how underdeveloped they are. Our responses tend to be focused on symptoms — like substance abuse — at best. And our resources put the onus on the struggling lawyer to seek out help instead of reaching out for lawyers who may not even know they’re struggling.

Michael Kasdan and I went to law school together and while I went about making fun of law firms on the internet, he went ahead and became an IP litigation partner. At least that’s a sliver of his job. He’s also an adjunct professor at NYU Law and does a ton of outside writing and speaking. He also deals with periodic depression and last week he [published a piece in The American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/20/how-i-took-leave-from-and-returned-to-my-firm-to-manage-my-depression/) detailing how he came to understand what was happening and how to even begin seeking out help.

And like so many of these stories, the helping hand had to come from outside the legal community.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Despite having good relationships with many of my partners and co-workers, I didn’t tell anyone at work what was happening. It was too embarrassing and fraught with risk. Almost 10 years into my legal career, I hadn’t once even heard or discussed the topic of mental health at work. And what would I even say? What would they think? It was terrifying. The stress and fear around these issues only intensified the underlying problem. But, with the support of my younger sister, who literally took me for the first time to get help, I began to see a therapist and work with a psychiatrist.

We’ve talked about this a bit over the years here at Above the Law, but providing access to mental health resources isn’t the same as providing effective mental health support. Banking on a lawyer availing themselves of these resources assumes both that the attorney is emotionally prepared to ask for help and that they even realize what “depression” is in the first place. No one can seek help if they don’t understand the issue itself. That’s why mental health responses have to be proactive and not reactive. It’s also why some of the most important mental health training needs to go to everyone at the firm who isn’t necessarily facing these challenges because they’re the ones in the trenches every day who need to be attuned to recognizing when a colleague needs a hand.

After taking medical leave, Kasdan returned to work determined to be more open about his experiences to challenge the stigmatization that can take over law firms when they avoid mental health conversations:

This time, when I returned to work, I decided to be relentlessly public and open about what happened. I have been speaking to my law firm partners and associates about my experiences, listening when they want to share their own and sharing advice on how we can do better. I have been connecting with as many people as I could find in the legal field who are passionate about addressing mental health and wellness. I joined the [Institute for Well-Being in Law](https://lawyerwellbeing.net/) (IWIL) and began to serve on their communication committee. I continued group therapy, attending weekly meetings of the [Lawyers Depression Project](https://www.lawyersdepressionproject.org/). I also began talking about mental health publicly in front of my colleagues, business connections, and clients on LinkedIn. I feel more healthy, energized, sharp and engaged than at any other point in my life.

But he’s only one guy out there doing his part. To build a better profession, it’s going to take leadership all over the industry:

This will also require strong leadership on a human and policy level. Workers need to know what they should do when they are feeling overwhelmed, what type of help and support is available, and understand that they will not be punished for seeking help.

As he points out, the pandemic managed to break down some of the walls around discussing mental health. Hopefully that momentum doesn’t evaporate as firms transition back to the new normal.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# The Most Common (Hidden) Managerial Error

You think you know bad managers: The screamers. The “hurry up and wait” guys. The folks who forget about work-life balance. You’ve seen them all.

But you may have overlooked the most common managerial error that isn’t so obvious, but affects many businesses. What’s the one error that people being managed don’t notice and many managers don’t even realize is a mistake?

Passing the blame.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
What do I mean?

You have to give performance ratings on a scale of one to five, with “one” meaning you’re getting fired tomorrow and “five” meaning you’re God’s gift to lawyers. (Naturally, because we live in [Lake Wobegon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Wobegon), everybody gets “fours.” But I’ll save that for another day.)

You’re giving a person who reports to you a “three,” which is just fine. But, because the person being given a “three” is a lawyer, the person is outraged: “I’m great! I’m certainly much better than all the other people who inhabit this joint! I deserve a ‘five’! At least a ‘four’! Why didn’t you give me a ‘four’?”

Now comes the standard bad management: “I really wanted to give you a ‘four,’ but senior leadership forbade it. I know you’re great, and you know you’re great, but the folks who run the joint just don’t understand. I tried, but I can’t convince them. That’s why I’m giving you a ‘three.'”

Notice how easy this is? Blame someone else. It avoids you having to take responsibility, and it sidesteps what might otherwise be a hard conversation.

Here’s a second example: The company has decided to conduct layoffs. You’re obligated to deliver the news to someone who works for you. This is hard.

Very hard.

Like almost-no-one-at-a-law-firm-actually-does-this-stuff hard. (Law firms leave these tasks to a select few lawyers or to people in the human resources department.)

So what do you do? Blame someone else: “I have some bad news for you. [Wait a beat here. It lets the recipient get his or her mind in gear. That’s why they teach physicians to use that silence: ‘I have some bad news for you. [Wait a beat.] The patient has died.’]”

Where was I?

Oh, yeah: “I have some bad news for you. [Beat] You’re being laid off. Your last day is the thirtieth, and you’re being given three months’ severance.”

“That’s an outrage! Why me?”

It’s time for bad management.

“I actually think that you’re a treasured member of the team, but senior management said we had to lay people off, and they decided you’re the one.”

You then must tell other people on your team about the layoff. Again, don’t take the blame: “I’m really suspicious of this organization. Somehow, we can always find money for the important guys to fly first class and take clients to dinner. And now we have to get rid of people who are just working hard for a living. But that’s what management said, so that’s what we’re doing. Today, I laid off [Cordelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordelia_%28King_Lear%29) as of the thirtieth.”

Nothing to it. Just blame someone else. That shows that you’re a good guy, and you don’t have to explain anything to anyone.

Except that it’s terrible management.

If you’re obligated to give some instruction, then you’re obligated to take personal (or, at least, joint) responsibility for what you do. You cannot insist that you’re blameless and an unnamed other person is responsible for the decision.

Find out why management is making a decision. Learn the justification for what’s being decided. And then own it. You’re giving the performance rating of ‘three.’ You’re laying somebody off. It’s you.

Otherwise, the object of your action — your direct report, for example — will legitimately want to speak to the person who actually made the decision: “You disagree with this? Fine! I disagree, too. So who can I talk to about this? Did your boss make this silly decision? If so, I want to talk directly to your boss! If it wasn’t your boss who made this decision, who was it? Your boss’s boss? The CEO? God? Let me speak to that person!”

If you’re a manager, you can’t pass the blame. If you’re implementing a decision, then you’re stuck with it.

I know that it’s much, much easier to say that you just work here, and you’re just carrying out orders.

But that’s not allowed.

If you’re asked to manage people, manage.

Over the course of the last year — and [especially during the past few months](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/paul-weisss-bold-leadership-on-coronavirus-pro-bono-efforts/) — members of the legal profession have sprung into action to deal with crisis after crisis after crisis, offering their services without cost to those in need. From challenging immigration policies to dealing with the ongoing fight for reproductive rights to securing freedom for the wrongfully convicted, lawyers in America were inspired to do their very best to help those who needed their assistance the very most.

But which law firms were able to contribute the most to society?

Each year, the National Law Journal honors the Biglaw firms that have taken on some of the biggest issues of our time, recognizing the firms that have made the most meaningful strides in offering access to justice. Here are the 18 firms that landed on the [2020 Pro Bono Hot List](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/05/04/the-2020-pro-bono-hot-list/) thanks to their expert handling of pro bono emergencies:

That’s the Am Law 50 getting that extra boost there.

Meet the new year, same as the old year.

The Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group and the Hildebrandt Consulting have released their [annual client advisory for 2018](https://www.privatebank.citibank.com/ivc/docs/2018CitiHildebrandtClientAdvisory.pdf) and the outlook is the same compilation of tepid optimism we’ve seen for the last few years. Demand is in the tank, partner headcount is flat, and operations are getting leaner.

Something new about this year’s report is how much closer the authors are to just calling out that the gap between the elite firms and the rest is growing at a healthy clip. It’s been a regular factor in the numbers behind every Citi report, yet the narrative always finds a way to dance around coming out and saying, “our data say if you aren’t an Am Law 25 firm, you’re probably screwed in this market.” They’ve still not gotten there, but this is pretty close.

Looking out to 2018, we project that industry revenue growth and profit per equity partner growth will remain in the mid-single-digit range on average. Behind these average results, we expect to see variability in individual firm performance, which will continue to drive consolidation in the industry.

A strong brand will be critical for firms to capture revenue growth in their established markets, practices, and industries. For some firms, further growth in this environment will come from expansion into new markets, practices, or industries. For many, growth will come from laterals or combinations.

Variability, consolidation, and “strong brand.” That’s as direct as it’s going to get, folks. Over the last couple of years, on balance, the path to success in the industry is being one of the very best of the best or being a smaller, more nimble shop capable of delivering quality results to clients at lower prices. Everyone in the middle fills that awkward space of being too expensive compared to their smaller competitors and not elite enough to convince clients that it’s worth the expense. That’s not a winning combination. Obviously there will be exceptions to every trend, but things don’t look great for the Jan Bradys of Biglaw.

Through the first nine months of 2017, the US law firm industry saw revenue growth of 3.6 percent. This has been entirely driven by standard rate increases (4.0 percent) as demand declined by 0.2 percent and collections slowed by 0.9 percent. The demand result is weaker than the 0.3 percent increase the industry saw during the same period of 2016, a year that ended with just a 0.1 percent increase in demand.

But don’t shed any tears for the Am Law 50, who saw a .9 percent increase in demand while the market as a whole went backward — with the Am Law 101-200 suffering a whopping 2.3 percent decline in demand. Where’s all this work going?

Beyond traditional law firm competitors, law firms will continue to face competition from alternative legal service providers, and from clients. While hard data is not readily available, it does appear that alternative legal service providers are growing rapidly (albeit from a very low base), and they are picking off low-value areas of legal work, thereby depressing demand growth for traditional law firms. In-house law departments continue to grow and keep more work in-house, although some view this as cyclical and likely to move in the other direction in time, as has happened in the past. For now, we note the rapid growth of the Corporate Legal Operations Consortium (CLOC) as evidence of in-house law departments’ continued progress and drive towards effciency. With a vision to provide a “seamless legal ecosystem that delivers corporate legal support to small, medium and large businesses with peak efficiency,” CLOC has become highly visible, and has the potential to bring increased pricing pressure to law firms.

The growth of CLOC certainly proves that clients think they can cull their outside counsel spend and move more work in-house. Certainly technology has advanced to make this a more realizable dream and its piqued a lot of interest, but whether or not that heralds a sweeping, long-term strategy shift or just represents flirtation from clients who don’t want to be out of the loop for the price of $195/year remains to be seen.

One interesting observation, especially coupled with the fact that firms with a strong international presence performed better than purely domestic shops, is the changing center of geographic expansion.

For 2018 and beyond, firms tell us that they see Asia as both a challenge and opportunity. Many firms simply feel they have to be present in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore because of the rapid growth occurring in Asia, regardless of the challenges. We expect further expansion of Chinese firms outside of China. Europe is generally viewed as a challenge with the exception of Paris. London is viewed by many firms as continuing to be an opportunity, though Brexit will pose challenges. Firms with a more robust continental Europe footprint could be better positioned to gain market share as Brexit plays out if some of the business currently done in London leaves the UK. In the US, firms generally point to opportunity in New York, California, Texas, and in Washington DC.

Finally, the flat population of equity partners is flagged as a growing risk. Too many firms have slowed their equity partner recruitment over the years to control costs and maximize leverage. It was a wise short-term strategy, but one that is now facing the ravages of time, with some 32 percent of equity partners at or approaching retirement age. The loss of such a huge chunk of senior leadership creates succession planning concerns for many. How firms deal with this will be a key development to watch over the next decade:

While this trend underscores the importance of succession planning, it raises questions about the size of the average equity partnership in the future. It also highlights the challenge frms face in retaining their best and brightest lawyers who aspire to become equity partners in an industry where the opportunity to become an equity partner has become slim. While some frms might deliberately shrink their equity partnerships, others are likely to become more focused on flling the gaps created by the slowed additions of recent years and the accelerated departures in the future. They will either do this through acquiring laterals, or increasing the rate of promotions through development of the talent pipeline in their leverage models.

Ultimately, the report ends on a note of muted optimism. The landscape isn’t ideal, but the top firms are growing — slowly — and the rest will end up merging or getting out of the way. After all, the legal industry is historically “resilient” we’re reminded, which is true. But it also feels disconcertingly like one of those statements that’s always true right up until it isn’t.

# When There Are 50: Pressure Mounts For President Biden To Assist Diversifying The Judiciary
## It would have also made sense for Biden to start in the Show Me state, but it seems like Missouri is already trying to ban MLK's influence.

President Biden ran on promises that he’d do his part to diversify this nation’s judiciary. And he actually did! Federally, that is. Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to and confirmation for SCOTUS has been a huge leap forward in this move toward equity; it is part of a bigger move of [making the judiciary more representative of the folks it presides over](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/biden-continues-crusade-diversify-federal-judgeships-with-five-new-picks-2022-04-13/). But what about at the state level? Sure, there’s the whole “Federalism” thing, but he at least said a few things about diversifying the judiciary in each of the 50 states, right?

That’s what Rev. Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III think, at least. The two penned an open letter to President Biden asking him to start supporting judicial diversity across the country, and what better spot to start than his home state of Delaware? We asked them a few questions about the significance of diversifying state courts and this is what they had to say.

Chris Williams (CW): What’s the importance of having a diverse judiciary?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Rev. Al Sharpton: I think you’ve got to have a diversity in the courts, in order to assure that you are not dealing in a time in America where only certain people could serve on the bench or serve on juries. And when you look at the Chancery Court and see that that does not reflect the population in Delaware, which is 40% people of color, and the president comes from that state, I think the president has done a significant job in diversity. He put a Black woman on the Supreme Court, as he promised he would. I was at the ceremony and he talked about, in the ceremony, how he’s appointed more Blacks and people of color to the federal bench and the other presidents before him combined. I just would like to see him urge the governors in his home state to do what he’s done nationally.

Martin Luther King III: [T]his is an opportunity for a governor to set a tone so that other governors might say, “You know what? This makes sense at this time in the history.” It should have already happened, quite frankly, but the fact of the matter is we’re still pushing to get equality in the system of justice… [W]e call it a criminal justice system. It is a criminal system, but it’s not just. Certainly not for Black, not for Latinos and Hispanics, not for people of color, and probably not even for poor white folk. It works if you have money and resources so that you can acquire the best legal persons to represent you. But the masses of people and particularly it disproportionately does not work for Black and brown people.

CW: For the average person whose experience with diversity is probably just people they meet walking down the street or attending the high school they went to, what’s something that they might not be aware of that they should be when it comes to having these discussions about race and equity?

Rev. Al Sharpton: I think that we’ve got to be intentional about diversity, and start having people from the college level on, to deal with how we develop a pipeline for diversity. But we should not think that it’s going to be a something that will happen by osmosis, it has to be intentional. Where I’ve been involved in the private sector and the public sector, and seen progress with diversity, is when people were committed to it.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Martin Luther King III: So I think that people inherently really do realize that the system is skewed and it is not… What they haven’t translated it down to is the fact of the matter is that every year we have an election. Most people vote for president, they may vote for governors, and may vote for mayors, some city council members, but they rarely know who the judges are, and they don’t even vote because there’s a lack of information. And maybe it hasn’t translated that I need to get another kind of person on the courts who may understand my plight. And so that is where I think the breakdown partially occurs. But not just the judges. It’s also the district attorneys, who people don’t necessarily always vote on also, understanding that he or she is going to be the chief prosecutor in that county. And again, if he or she doesn’t understand your culture, they may… They’ve got guidelines that they have to go by with the law, but they also have the latitude to say, “We’re going to recommend a sentence of six months and maybe not six years.” Because what has historically happened is when it comes to communities of color, the sentences that are recommended are far longer than the sentences that are recommended oftentimes for whites. Just like policemen in the Black community. And this is probably universal, although I don’t have the statistics. What I know over the years is when Black children are picked up, they take them to jail, juvenile. When white children are picked up or something, they generally take them home to their parents. So the white kid doesn’t end up getting… I mean, unless it’s a heinous crime, like killing or something. That’s pretty much everybody who’s doing those kind of crimes goes to jail.

CW: Sometimes they go to Burger King first.

Martin Luther King III: We’ve seen that happen with Dylann Roof, as an example. So you’re right. I mean, there’s a totally different orientation and standard. And the standard, whatever it is, just needs to be the same for everyone, that most people want fairness. But yet again, we don’t always translate that in the community as, “Okay, I need to vote for a judge because the judge is going to determine the fate of my community.” And oftentimes those judges have been white, so they may not understand. It doesn’t mean they’re bad people, they just don’t have the experience to understand and have some degree of empathy when it comes to our community, because they are programmed, just like the system programs the fact that police will say, well… And you have all these pundits who are saying things like, “Well, Black folk are committing all the crimes. That’s why we are arresting them.”

Now, there’s a lot of crime everywhere right now, and there are a lot of Black folk who are involved in crimes, but as I said, there are white folk that are involved in crimes too, but oftentimes they get a different standard. So diversifying the courts at the state level can help to bring about a change. And it’s good for the nation. It really is good for everybody. I mean, I just think that diversity has made our nation, whatever wonderful things that we’ve done, part of it has been because there’s been diversity and opportunity.

# Biglaw Partner Survives Texas Snowpocalypse Thanks To A Little Help From His Friends

The water is gushing down, my wife runs out in the front and, lo and behold, some of our neighbors are testing out how to open up the covers so that you can turn the water valves off. They come running over, towels in hand, to sop up the water, move furniture, because it flooded our den and then it seeped down, flooded into our garage. But within 45 minutes we had all the water picked up all because of some terrific neighbors.

— [Bill Mateja](https://www.sheppardmullin.com/bmateja), a partner at Sheppard Mullin, commenting on what he and his family have done to get by during the unprecedented snowstorm in Texas that’s [caused millions to go without electricity, heat, and water](https://www.law.com/2021/02/18/its-been-horrible-texas-lawyers-struggle-with-power-outages-burst-pipes-no-water/). A water pipe connected to Mateja’s master bathroom burst on Tuesday, flooding his den. “I probably heard of a hundred friends that have had pipes burst,” he said. “What’s different about this time is the duration of the cold snap and how cold it was. It got down to -2 in Dallas one night.”

Harvard Law School and Lateral Link have a special relationship. Our founder and CEO, [Michael Allen](https://www.laterallink.com/team/michael-allen/), is a proud and active HLS alumnus. The head of our partner practice, [Gloria Sandrino](https://www.laterallink.com/team/gloria-sandrino/), also graduated from Harvard Law. We believe we have worked with more Harvard Law alumni as candidates than practically any other recruiting firm.

Why? One reason so many HLS alums work with us is that by doing so, they are effectively giving back to their alma mater.

In 2015, Mike Allen established the [Lateral Link Scholarship Fund](https://hls.harvard.edu/alumni/honoring-donors/michael-a-allen-04-initiates-a-new-scholarship-at-harvard-law-school/#:~:text=The%20firm%20will%20fund%20the,of%20Harvard%20Law%20School%20alumni.&text=For%20every%20talented%20graduate%20who,studying%20at%20Harvard%20Law%20School.%E2%80%9D) at Harvard Law School, with an initial commitment of $250,000. Whenever Lateral Link makes a placement of an HLS alum into a law firm or other legal employer, 10 percent of the placement fee goes into the Fund, which supports financial aid at the Law School.

The ties between HLS and Lateral Link have deepened further with our latest recruiter hire: [Amanda Mindlin](https://www.laterallink.com/team/9934/), HLS class of 2014. She works with lawyers, law firms, and in-house legal departments throughout the East Coast, helping candidates find great wonderful new opportunities and helping employers find superb new talent.

Earlier this week, I spoke by phone with Amanda about her legal career, her move into recruiting, and why she decided to join Lateral Link.

DL: Hello, Amanda, and welcome to Lateral Link! You never know where anyone is working from these days – where am I catching you right now?

AM: Right now, my husband and I are in Babcock Ranch, Florida – America’s first solar-powered town – but we’re moving to Sarasota soon.

DL: And you’re a longtime Floridian, as I recall?

AM: Yes. I grew up in Sarasota, went to the University of Florida for college, and am a lifelong Florida Gators fan. Although I studied abroad a few times, I only lived in another state while I was at HLS.

DL: What led you to trade the Florida sunshine for three years in cold and snowy Cambridge?

AM: I never planned on going to law school. I majored in political science, which I loved, and wanted to pursue a Ph.D. to become a professor. But around the time of my graduation in 2010, a number of my professors were getting laid off because of recession-related budget cuts, so they advised me against that.

My roommate at the time was preparing to take the LSAT, so I signed up for a prep class with her and ended up doing surprisingly well. With my grades and LSAT score, going to law school was the path of least resistance.

DL: How did you like law school?

AM: I loved it! It was so much fun. I took great classes and met so many incredibly interesting people. I sang opera growing up, so I participated in Parody, the law school musical, which was a blast. And I saw snow for the first time.

DL: Did you always plan on returning to Florida?

AM: Actually, I considered staying in Boston. I spent my 1L summer working in-house at MassMutual, which was great, and I spent my 2L summer in Boston at Bingham McCutchen.

Bingham was having issues at the time – it ultimately went under in 2014, the year I graduated – so early in my 3L year, I applied for federal clerkships.

Luckily, even though I applied late in the cycle, I got an interview with Judge Middlebrooks of the Southern District of Florida. The interview couldn’t have gone better – we spent much of it chatting about Gator football – and he made me an offer on the spot, which I immediately accepted.

It wound up being an amazing year. I couldn’t have clerked for a better judge. For law students interested in litigation, a federal clerkship is a wonderful experience if you can get it.


Amanda Mindlin (via Lateral Link)

DL: And then how did you find your first job post-clerkship?

AM: I met my now-husband during my clerkship. He was based in Miami but was eager to get out and encouraged me to look for opportunities up in West Palm, where I was clerking. There are only so many firms in West Palm, so I interviewed with most of them, including Shutts & Bowen.

The firm has an excellent reputation, and my judge spoke very highly of them. They had a patent trial before my judge at the time (which I was recused from), and I was impressed with them in the courtroom.

I’d long been interested in pursuing IP litigation. Shutts was really the only major firm in West Palm with an IP group, so it was a pretty easy decision!

DL: How did you like your time at Shutts & Bowen?

AM: I couldn’t have been at a better firm. I loved my group – my husband and I still hang out with the partner I worked with most closely. And they really gave me the freedom to pursue the work I was most interested in.

My issue was that I’m a pretty social person, and I found the practice of law to be extremely isolating. Writing is probably my greatest strength, so I wound up doing a lot of brief writing – which by its nature involves spending a lot of time by yourself researching and writing.

It quickly became obvious that I needed a job with more social interaction. My sister-in-law, a successful executive recruiter, suggested I pursue legal recruiting, which sounded like it would be a perfect fit for me.

DL: And has it been?

AM: Absolutely! As a recruiter, I’m constantly talking to other people – associates, partners, recruiting coordinators, colleagues – and I’m constantly meeting interesting people from different backgrounds.

There’s so much diversity in the job; it doesn’t get boring. Every candidate is different, and every search is different. I work across different practice areas and cities – New York, Boston, D.C., Florida – so I’m constantly learning about different fields of law and legal markets.

DL: What do you enjoy the most about recruiting?

AM: The matchmaking aspect. I really get to know my candidates – to the point where sometimes I know what they’re looking for better than they do. For example, sometimes a candidate will tell me that they only want to apply to Biglaw firms, but I suggest that they consider this one boutique – and then they end up going to that boutique over several Biglaw firms, and loving it there.

My candidates have been very happy at the firms I’ve placed them at, which is extremely rewarding. Some of them were miserable and thinking about leaving law before we started working together, but as it turned out, they just weren’t at the right firms.

DL: You came to Lateral Link as an experienced recruiter, having worked at another legal search firm before this. What drew you to Lateral Link?

AM: First, Lateral Link’s excellent reputation within the legal profession. When I was thinking about switching recruiting firms, I spoke to many different people – contacts from my HLS network, lawyers and recruiting professionals at law firms, people at other recruiting firms – and everyone spoke highly of Lateral Link. I wanted to be at a firm with a strong reputation, which makes it easier to connect with candidates and with law firms.

Second, Lateral Link is a welcoming place to recruiters coming from other recruiting shops. I was struck by how many of my colleagues here used to work at other top search firms.

Finally, I was drawn to Lateral Link’s commitment to [diversity and inclusion](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/one-simple-way-to-improve-your-recruitment-of-diverse-candidates/). So many of Lateral Link’s recruiters, especially its leaders, are women and/or diverse, and as a result, many of Lateral Link’s candidates are women and/or diverse as well. I’m very proud to be part of this team.

DL: And we are very proud to have you – a Harvard Law School graduate, former federal law clerk, and former associate at an Am Law 200 law firm – joining us. Welcome again to Lateral Link, Amanda!

* Massachusetts US Attorney accused of abuse of power “to achieve a political goal epitomiz[ing] the type of ‘political justice’ that Congress intended to prohibit.” Too bad she wasn’t a judge taking free vacations from parties before the court… she’d be home free by now.[[Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1678635)]

* WilmerHale earned 5 percent of its total revenue from Meta, the company you remember as Facebook before they completely retooled to chase a creepy VR chat room that they’ve [since killed](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2023/may/13/death-of-mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-meta-facebook-virtual-reality-ai) after costing the company about $13 billion. Which is all to say that Wilmer may want to diversify its revenue streams at this rate.

# 3 Factors That Make Law Firms So Toxic

Ever wonder exactly what makes law firms such miserable places to work? Oh, sure, some people work their whole careers at them, content in their day-to-day lives, but they are the minority. The rest find that the long hours, pressure, and lack of advancement opportunities make the experience a terrible one.

The Biglaw business model is predicated upon grinding out the overwhelming majority of an entering class over seven years so that only a few, hardy souls are left in the race to make it to partner. It takes a lot of long hours, incomplete instructions, tight deadlines — both real and imagined — and a healthy dose of a dismissive attitude to make the majority of your employees leave within a few years.

Our friends at Law360 have [attempted to diagnose](http://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/818482) exactly what makes law firm life so unpleasant. They’ve identified 3 factors they say are universal in toxic law firms:

1. Inconsistent Feedback

“All firms that I’ve ever worked with struggle with this,” said [Jill Huse](http://society54.com/jill/) [co-founder of professional services consulting firm Society 54 LLC]. “I have found that it can be very difficult for attorneys to hold their fellow colleagues and partners accountable, partly because they tend to avoid dealing with perceived conflicts and having difficult conversations.”
…
“While you would think that attorneys would be more comfortable than the average person at conflict resolution, when it comes to having these critical conversations with their colleagues, many are very resistant,” Huse said.

The classic “lack of feedback” issue comes right before stealth layoffs. An associate hasn’t heard any complaints about his work, but that doesn’t mean there haven’t been rumblings. Next thing our unsuspecting associate knows, they’re being told how the firm “isn’t the right fit,” and they are editing their résumé. Tough break.

2. Little Room for Growth

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
[F]irms that allow associates to wallow in “assembly line” positions where they work a lot of hours with an opaque and winding path to partnership or other advancement opportunities are likely creating unhealthy competition, bad blood and unhappiness among their junior lawyers, [legal consultant [Ed Poll](http://www.lawbiz.com/about_old.html)] said.

Here’s a fun thought experiment for summer associates: look around at your healthy ranks. If you’re lucky, three of you will make partner.

3. Lack of Openness

“There is either a lack of communication being shared or bifurcated communication depending on a person’s status within the firm and what he/she is privy,” [Huse] said. “The lack of communication is often viewed as a lack of transparency, which will ultimately cause a loss of trust and declining morale.”

At Above the Law we hear all sorts of gripes about firms’ lack of openness: partners learning about potential mergers through the press, associates hanging for weeks waiting to hear if their firm was even considering increasing compensation, attorneys not being told of staff layoffs until they spent time looking for their (now former) assistant. None of it makes the cogs that power the law firm machine feel like anything other than the aforementioned cogs.

So law firm powers that be: be aware of the misery and distrust your standard operating procedures are leaving in their wake. And lowly associates — maybe you should start working on your exit strategy.

Here is one of my predictions for law firms of the future:

Somewhere between five and 10 years from now:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- Top lawyers will bill at $5,000 to $10,000 per hour
- Other lawyers will find their billing rates the same as today or even lower
- There will be very few top lawyers and very many other lawyers
Why do I think this is the case?

It is the way things are moving in all industries. The internet and availability of information creates stars. You see it with YouTube, with TikTok, with Instagram, and with other social media. Those that get a lot of press — followers — become ungodly wealthy and successful. And the rest are basically ignored and cannot get money for their services.

Consider that little boy you may have heard of — I think 6 years old — making more than $5 million a year opening toys on YouTube.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The flywheel of social media and other forces reinforces all of this. The more successful one becomes, the easier it is to become still more successful. And for the rest of the people, nothing is doing.

My prediction is already happening in the law business. I see it every day. The legal Rock Stars have seen billing rates scale the — formerly unthinkable — $1,000 per hour several years ago. And now many large firm lawyers are more like $1,500 per hour — and approaching (and I hear anecdotally hitting) — $2,000 per hour.

And it all makes sense doesn’t it? How much would you pay for the top M&A lawyer on your $10 billion deal? Is it $1,000 an hour? $2,000 an hour? Or $10,000 an hour? It doesn’t matter does it?

Or if you are wealthy and there is a chance of going to jail! Are you going to the cost-effective lawyer or are you seeking out the tippy-top lawyer irrespective of cost?

In these instances, you simply want the best lawyer, and money really is no object. So it all comes down to being known as the best lawyer for the job.

Let me repeat that: “It all comes down to being known as the best lawyer for the job.”

For simplicity in writing, I will define the concept of being known to be the best lawyer for the job in this article as being the “Best Known.”

If you are not the Best Known, then the purchaser immediately thinks about the cost. And if you are not one of the Best Known, then it is a race to the bottom, i.e., the cheapest provider of the legal service.

For this reason, my prediction makes eminent sense. Those who are thought of as the Best Known can charge whatever they like, and clients will be very happy to pay it. Those who are not the Best Known will struggle to charge a pittance, and clients will likely be annoyed to pay it.

Fair? I guess not.

But reality? Yes.

You may be reading this and saying: “Thanks, Bruce, for this interesting statement that my career — and life — are about to suck. But how about something more useful, like what am I going to do about it?????”

I have very specific thoughts about this; namely, how to position yourself to be the Best Known, and I will share that in my next article.

# Neither Of These Top Biglaw Firms Will Require Attorneys To Return To The Office In 2021

We want to be mindful of and supportive of the associates for whom return to the office may be difficult this year. What happens beyond 2021 is anybody’s guess in terms of how the pandemic shapes the way we work.

— [Tom Cerabino](https://www.willkie.com/professionals/c/cerabino-thomas-m), co-managing partner of Willkie Farr, commenting on the fact that his firm [will not require any of its attorneys to return to the office](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/03/05/some-firms-eye-summer-return-to-office-while-others-rule-out-a-2021-return-completely/) for in-person work in 2021. Wilson Sonsini will not be requiring any of its attorneys to return to the office this year, either. “The reality is our teams have adapted very well to working virtually and remotely,” managing partner [Doug Clark](https://www.wsgr.com/en/people/douglas-j-clark.html) said. “[W]e as a firm will be much more flex with alternative work arrangements than we ever imagined we’d be in the past.” Both Willkie and Wilson Sonsini lawyers who want to go back to the office may do so, as long as they follow local regulations and health precautions.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Top-Ranked Biglaw Firm Announces Market Bonuses, But Only For Associates In Some Offices
## Oof. Associates who won't be receiving matching bonuses are 'pissed.'

And just like that, another big-money firm bites the dust when it comes to offering special bonuses to its associates. Last week, on April 2, we made a list of the [remaining Top 50 Am Law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/wheres-the-money-these-am-law-top-50-firms-havent-announced-bonuses-yet/) that had yet to join the bonus bandwagon, and one of those firms was Norton Rose, which came in 12th place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, having brought in $1,904,019,000 gross revenue in 2019. Now, less than a week later, the outlook has changed, and associates (in some locations), are very happy.

Sources tell us that sometime yesterday, Norton Rose announced special bonuses in line with the generous Davis Polk scale. These is what that looks like at the firm (a memo from NRF is available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/nrf-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As noted in the firm’s memo, only associates in California, New York, Texas, and Washington, D.C. will be receiving the bonuses outlined in that chart. Associates in Denver, St. Louis, and Minneapolis will receive bonus payouts on a “regional scale.” NRF is only the second firm we know of that’s decided to institute regional bonus payments. ([Stroock](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/stroock-special-bonus-2021/) will be “incorporat[ing] local market factors” for associates in its Los Angeles and Miami offices.) According to one of our sources, “Associates are rightly pissed and won’t be around much longer.” Yikes.

It looks like associates will receive payments in June and in December, based on 1950 client and firm chargeable annualized hours (including up to 50 diversity and/or pro bono hours and approved shadow time). True-up payments are available in December for those who missed the hourly threshold in June but later caught up. Congratulations to (almost) everyone.

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/nrf-special-bonus-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Norton Rose Fulbright.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# An Open Letter To Incoming First-Year Associates
## Biglaw: it may be a sprint at times, but it's also a marathon.

Dear Class of 2020 Associates,

After three years — actually 25+ years — of hard work, you’re finally beginning your legal career. Some of you will start in a new office, and some of you will be starting remotely. These are weird times, and no one can fully prepare you for the months to come within this new paradigm. But certain themes will hold true no matter what the physical set-up may be.

Fifteen years ago, I was in your shoes, starting out as a first-year associate at Cleary Gottlieb in New York City. Here are 10 of the most important takeaways I can share from my seven-plus years as a Biglaw associate and seven-plus years (and counting) as a legal recruiter:

- [Pick your practice area](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/picking-the-right-law-firm-and-practice-area-for-you/) intentionally and wisely, thinking ahead about where you see yourself in terms of industry, lifestyle, and [geography](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/03/planning-for-a-legal-career-overseas-part-i-picking-the-right-practice-area-and-the-right-firm/), five, 10, and 20 years down the road.
- Trust that the little stuff counts more than you now know. Be responsive and organized, meet deadlines, and pay attention to detail, appreciating that no job is too menial.
- Take extra time — no matter how busy you are or late it is — to understand the bigger picture. Force yourself to answer the underlying “why?”s and “how?”s on every matter you work on.
- Request, appreciate, and work with constructive feedback.
- Keep up on the latest law firm and industry news, and make an effort to learn your clients’ businesses.
- Keep your eyes open and be the ardent guardian of your professional development.
- Start developing your own [business plan](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/why-lawyers-need-to-have-business-plans-no-matter-what/) from Day 1.
- Be proactive in your career planning. Don’t trust the firm and your supervisors blindly. Recognize that career planning is a continuous and thoughtful process, not a one-and-done crisis management tool.
- Develop a relationship with a recruiter you trust so that you understand the legal market and your options at all times.
- Develop authentic relationships — with partners, peer lawyers, administrative staff and janitorial staff, and in your networking efforts. Treat everyone with equal respect and positivity.
For additional tips for getting your legal career off to the best possible start, see my articles on [25 Things All Young Lawyers Should Know In Order To Not Screw Up Their Legal Careers](http://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/25-things-all-young-lawyers-should-know-in-order-to-not-screw-up-their-legal-careers-2/)%20http://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/25-things-all-young-lawyers-should-know-in-order-to-not-screw-up-their-legal-careers-2/)) and [Lessons For Success From A Former Biglaw Associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/lessons-for-success-from-a-former-biglaw-associate/).

I urge you to reach out to me — not just when you’re planning an imminent move, but as you’re navigating your first year, deciding on a practice area, grappling with any other professional development questions, or seeking to just open a dialogue.

I wish you all the very best of luck in your new careers. Work hard, all the while learning and taking care of yourselves, mentally and physically. It may be a sprint at times, but it’s also a marathon.

Yours sincerely,

[Abby Gordon](https://www.laterallink.com/team/abby-gordon/)

# Biglaw Firm Swipes ~50 Lawyers From DLA Piper, Adds $100 Million In Revenue
## That's a baller move.

The churn of lateral moves from one Biglaw shop to another is a normal part of life in the legal industry. Sure, sometimes [feelings can be hurt](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/john-quinn-is-not-happy-about-selendy-gay-and-he-sent-the-angry-reply-all-to-prove-it/), but by and large, it is just a reality. Sometimes, however, there’s something unique about a firm’s raid on another firm’s attorneys.

Take, for example, McDermott Will & Emery’s latest acquisitions. According to an internal memo [obtained by](http://biglawbusiness.com/mcdermott-expands-with-dozens-of-dla-attorneys-san-francisco-office/) Big Law Business, MWE chairman Ira Coleman revealed the firm was adding approximately 50 partners, counsel, and associates across the real estate finance, employment, and litigation groups. The new hires include some big hitters including litigator Mike Poulos, employment partner Mike Sheehan, and real estate finance attorney Jeffrey Steiner, all of whom will join their new firm’s management committee. Other partners joining MWE include Scott Weinberg and Robert Unger in the real estate finance practice; Ellen Bronchetti, Rachel Cowen, Pankit Doshi, Dave Durham, Ron Holland, Maria Rodriguez, Chris Foster, Marilyn Pearson, and Michelle Strowhiro in the employment practice; and Seth Friedman, Tim Hoeffner, Raphael Larson, Mike Piazza, Nicole Figueroa, Jason Gerstein, and Larry Wojcik in litigation.

According to Coleman, the new hires are expected to add $100 million in revenue on a yearly basis. And MWE will be opening a new office in San Francisco later this year to support the new lawyers.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We are delighted that these outstanding attorneys have chosen McDermott as their new home,” Coleman said in a statement to Big Law Business. “We look forward to bringing their experience to bear for our current clients, and to introducing their clients to the breadth and depth of our platform. Our immediate priority, of course, is welcoming our colleagues and ensuring a seamless transition for everyone. At the same time, we also wish our respected industry peer, DLA, much continued success.”

Congratulations to MWE and their ~50 new attorneys.

“Aim and I shoot for the stars / At the awards I ain’t win no awards / Only meaning one thing, don’t get tired, I go hard.” — [Kevin Gates](https://genius.com/4393654)

Women now make up the [majority of law students](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/business/dealbook/women-majority-of-us-law-students-first-time.html?_r=0) in our country. But more law degrees for women doesn’t necessarily translate to better job prospects. In fact, [new research indicates](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/business/dealbook/more-law-degrees-for-women-but-fewer-good-jobs.html) that female law students are clustered in lower-ranked schools, and fewer women are enrolled in the country’s most prestigious institutions, according to Elizabeth Olson of the New York Times.

Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to catch up with [Paola Cecchi-Dimeglio](http://www.paolacecchidimeglio.com/), a Ph.D., LL.M., J.D., and the Faculty Chair of the Executive Leadership Research Initiative for Women and Minority Attorneys (ELRIWMA) at the Center for the Legal Profession at Harvard Law School and a Senior Research Fellow, jointly appointed at Harvard Law School (PON) and at the Harvard Kennedy School (Women and Public Policy Program (WAPPP)).

Dimeglio’s research focuses on the complex intersection between human behavior, organizational culture, and economics. Dimeglio’s work has recently been featured in articles such as [To Hire More Women, Follow These Steps](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202760038004/To-Hire-More-Women-Follow-These-Steps-?slreturn=20170011082214) and [Does Your Firm’s Website Repel Women?](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202773792048/Does-Your-Firms-Website-Repel-Women?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL) Next month, and throughout the year, several more organizations will publish her findings on how small actions can have a tremendous impact. For instance, some nudges have led to double-digit increases in the hiring of women.

In the meantime, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Paola Cecchi-Dimeglio (PCD):  My own personal and professional experience as a lawyer is an influence, but what truly motivates me every day is something bigger – it is the contribution I can make and particularly the seeds I can plant to change our world for the better. This is something my grandparents and my parents have taught me and done for me, and it is what I am hoping to do for my children and grandchildren.

You know the adage: don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant. Furthermore, as you know, all the research that I’ve done and others have done demonstrates that diversity, broadly speaking, actually leads to better outcomes. I think the best outcomes largely come from diversity of thought and diversity in the way we solve problems.

Renwei Chung (RC): You have had a couple pieces of research recently published about the benefits of “nudges.” Can you tell us what you mean by this term?

PCD: Well, let me start by telling you that before research reaches the general public it too often takes longer than it should. The work you mentioned that was just published in the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202760038004/To-Hire-More-Women-Follow-These-Steps-?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL), for instance, is the outcome of several years of work with various domestic and international law firms.

I am very grateful to my colleagues and peers such as Daniel Kahneman, Cass Sunstein, Daniel Ariely, Kathleen Mcginn and Iris Bohnet who have laid the groundwork for bringing the notion of “nudges” to the general public. In a nutshell, while there are quite a few versions of nudges, basically it’s the application of findings from psychology and behavioral  economics  to  prompt  people and organizations  to  make  decisions that are consistent with their long-term goals.  In fact, I will say that closing the gender gap in our profession is feasible in practice by using nudges.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Once the stages women move through – from potential applicant all the way to leadership roles such as partner and equity partner – are segmented and defined, we can begin to identify the points at which these processes are impeded or biased.

Processes can then be redesigned, and (with the commitment of the leadership) an organization’s behavior can be modified to remove the barriers and biases that keep women out. These targeted modifications and redesigns I call “nudges.” In sum, nudges are change strategies implemented by organizations and carried out by the individuals within that organization. Nudges are action-oriented and effective; they are built on carefully analyzed data analytics.

RC: You mentioned that numbers don’t lie, that numbers tell a story and we must find out this story. You have said the legal profession needs an intervention. Yet, you remain very optimistic there will be increased diversity and inclusion in the profession. Why?

PCD: First, let me say that numbers give the ability to identify patterns, develop new tools, and overall improve approaches to tackle problems. It’s a wealth of information. You don’t simply rely on your gut feeling. You are making informed or evidence-based choices. The data analytics ecosystem approach offers ways to deal with the challenge of achieving scaled solutions in a meaningful and efficient way to increase diversity and inclusion.

Second, my optimism is grounded in the work that I am doing with several international and domestic law firms. They very much recognize this as a strategic issue, and they have a true willingness to better represent the clients they want to serve. It is a critical piece of the equation. You need to have people inside the company who reflect the people you’re trying to serve. More and more organizations today see that achieving diversity requires investing in mechanisms to encourage diversity and are willing to make that investment.

RC: Based on the data, preferences, and choices you have researched, what are some of the root causes for the lack of diversity in the profession?

PCD: This is a very complex question, and there is no easy way to respond to it, but let me say that we have really stalled in progress on gender diversity, to the point where it will now likely take more than 100 years to reach parity. I think everyone can agree that’s a dissatisfying conclusion and raises a lot of questions about what needs to be done differently.

Everyone assumes the reason women are not moving into leadership roles or moving into the more senior ranks of a firm is really simple: that women have children, and that they leave the workforce. But that’s just a fraction of what’s going on.

The root causes are way more complex that we often think. For instance, what plays a role is how performance is measured, unconscious biases in hiring and promotion decisions, and the image a firm’s website conveys, which may undermine its hiring objectives. It is like an iceberg: we often see only the top of the iceberg, but the bottom is often way deeper and wider than you can see and or imagine.

RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

PCD: First, I want to thank them for reading this article and you, Renwei, for the opportunity to share with you some of my work. Second, I will tell them that they are the agents of change, and that we can close the gender gap and bring a more diverse leadership in our profession.

RC: On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Paola Cecchi-Dimeglio for sharing her findings with our audience. We wish her continued success in her research and work.

If you were a hacker trying to decide your next target, you’d likely want to pick an entity that has highly valuable and useful information that, simultaneously, lacks an effective security program.

Though so many of us focus a significant portion of our in-house practices on cybersecurity and data breaches, it may not come to mind right away that this target is right in our backyard: the law firm.

In a recent [webinar](http://education.logikcull.com/webinar-protecting-against-petya-7-2017/) put on by [Logikcull](http://logikcull.com/), Olga Mack and [Brian Focht](https://www.fochtlawfirm.com/) ([@NCCyberAdvocate](https://twitter.com/NCCyberAdvocate)) discussed not only the vulnerabilities every law firm is facing, but specifically focused on the kinds of cyber and data security related questions in-house counsel should be asking when hiring outside counsel.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As entities, law firm systems contain highly-sensitive financial data, corporate strategies, trade secrets, business transaction information and plenty of both PIIA and PHI. Unfortunately, many firms lack a complete, effective, privacy and security program. According to an ALM Legal Intelligence study, 22% of law firms did not have an organized plan in place to prepare for or respond to a data breach. Only 50% of law firms included in the study have cyber security teams in place to handle and implement the types of complex programs and initiatives necessary to deal with a data breach.

And, unsurprisingly, hackers have noticed these vulnerabilities. In February of 2016, Russian cybercriminal, under the name of “Oleras,” targeted law firms; in March,  the Wall Street Journal reported that the nation’s biggest firms have been hacked (including names like Cravath and Weil Gotshal); in April, the “Panama Papers” were leaked, revealing confidential attorney-client information detailing tax evasion techniques; in May, a Chicago-based law firm was sued by a client for cybersecurity flaws that “systematically expos[ed] confidential client information”; in December, the DOJ charged three Chinese nationals for insider trading based on information hackers obtains from law firms.

2017 didn’t bring better news. In June, a ransomware attack exploiting a vulnerability in Windows, shut down DLA Piper. When DLA Piper’s was first hit in Madrid, and then kept going throughout its global offices. It shut down email, phone and computer systems forcing DLA to request extensions in at least five civil cases. It took almost a week for DLA to restore its email and other systems. Undoubtedly, this caused a great loss of productivity, billable hours and an increase in the potential for client-driven litigation. Logikcull ran the numbers: the loss of billable hours in DLA Piper’s DC office alone could cost well over $500,000 a day.

Focht also brought up the example of [Moses Afonso Ryan Ltd. v. Sentinel Insurance Co., Ltd](https://www.scribd.com/document/348624306/MOSES-AFONSO-RYAN-LTD-V-SENTINEL-INSURANCE-COMPANY-LIMITED-Complaint-Filed-4-21-2017), a firm that fell victim to a ransomware attack and sued its insurance carrier to cover $700,000 in lost billings. What’s even scarier is the tedious and lengthy process the firm had to go through to recover its data. A picture is, indeed, sometimes worth a thousand words:

Clearly, in-house counsel need to be proactive in making sure their outside counsel are taking the necessary steps to minimize an attack’s impact on sensitive data. So here are the 9 questions you should always ask your outside counsel about its security measures and [readiness in the event of a cyberattack](https://www.slideshare.net/OlgaMackKotlyarevska/is-your-law-firm-cyberattacck-ready):

- Does your firm use Two Factor Authentication (aka 2FA)? It is a good idea for law firms sign up for 2FA for all services and/or applications housing sensitive data. 2FA puts an extra barrier in the way of someone who wants to access email, data storage, or other systems storing confidential data. With 2FA, a password is not sufficient to gain access. Instead, you need to enter both your password, and a secondary code – typically sent to your smartphone via SMS message or via an app like Google Authenticator.
- How often does the firm update its operating system? While installing updates is annoying, it is strongly recommended for security reasons. Many updates involve fixing known bugs in the operating system (Windows or Mac) that create security vulnerabilities. How does your law firm make sure that every device installs those pesky OS updates as soon as they’re available?
- What’s encrypted and how? It’s simple to encrypt the entire disk of either a Mac or PC. The benefits are enormous and the costs are negligible. With encryption, the contents are unreadable unless you’ve logged in with your password. Devices and laptops get stolen all the time, and desktop computers are also vulnerable. Law firms need to intentionally encrypt more of their data – and be able to explain their efforts.
- Do you use a password manager to set strong passwords? The human brain can only hold so many good passwords. Weak passwords based on things like the names of our pets, our addresses, or simply the word “password” or “12345678” should be avoided. Password managers can help generate strong passwords and manage credentials for multiple accounts – requiring you to only remember one good password.
- Do you regularly educate your employees about security? If so, how? Many security breaches result from hackers tricking users into doing things such as downloading a file infected with malware, sending sensitive data to the hacker, or sharing account credentials with the hacker. It is important to ensure that all members of the law firm – both staff and lawyers — are educated about both phishing and security. Everyone should know how to spot red flags, and how to react to a potential security threat.
- What’s your security insurance coverage? What and whom does it cover? All the caution in the world can’t prevent every cyberattack throughout a law firm’s entire lifetime. It’s important to make sure that law firms are insured just in case a breach does occur.
- Do you have a disaster recovery and incidence response plan? Similarly, it’s important to know a law firm’s plan once something does go wrong. How does the firm plan on recovering? Do all key employees understand what role they play? It’s as important to prevent as it is to respond. Since there’s a high chance your data may be impacted, you should know what the firm will do should a cyberattack occur.
- What does your physical security look like? In addition to talking about prevention, planning and training, it’s important to inquire about the physical security of the space and how the firm controls access to sensitive information.
- Do you conduct regular security risk assessments? While it’s great if a firm seems to be on top of security, its plans are only valuable if the firm stays current with the most up to date risks to its systems. Hackers get better and better every day, and your firm needs to know whether it’s systems are open to new vulnerabilities.
While it’s easy to dismiss these questions as “typical legal overthinking.” ultimately, even if you never need to use it, having an intentional and systematic security approach is a competitive advantage. After all, it’s better to have one and not need it, then the other way around!

# All You Need Is Succession Planning: Practicing In The Era Of Mandatory Retirement
## Many firms openly embrace lateral partners beyond the mandatory retirement age.

As baby boomers continue to push past 65, firms are faced with the dilemma succinctly posed by Paul McCartney, “Will they still need [them], will they still feed [them], when [they’re] 64?” Partners are invaluable contributors to law firms. Their experience and business generation are the pillars that support the behemoth of Biglaw, but concerns about mandatory retirement center around two key questions: how do we safeguard ourselves against the inevitable decline of acuity, and how do we ensure that junior partners don’t pile up on the ladder to business succession if partners postpone retirement?

For the former, a [plethora of research](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/194636) has shown that cognitive decline is slowed by mental stimulation, which law provides in spades. Pegging the retirement age to a national standard assumes uniform decline which may not be the case. That being said, the higher incidences of alcohol abuse and inadequate sleep among attorneys likely diminishes some of these gains.

For the latter, later retirements mean a logjam at the top of the business succession chain. Though the baby boomer generation opened up the ranks for a lot more partner positions, Biglaw could face a lost generation of partners who are being crowded out of clients by the late-retiring baby boomers.

Firms risk potentially alienating their junior attorneys by catering to the tried and proven. The long-term impact of such policies could be disastrous, which is why many firms are turning to succession plans to keep all parties happy.

Roughly half of Am Law 200 firms have some mandatory retirement policy. Not all stipulate retirement at 65 — most range roughly from 63-68, with different protocols as to how to deal with retiring attorneys. Some firms will transition partners into counsel positions where they can practice while transferring their clients and work to younger partners with longer runways, and others broach the topic of the impending retirement a year or two in advance to ease the partner’s transition out of the law firm.

Not all policies are made equal. Some firms advertise a mandatory retirement age but are willing to skirt it for rainmakers or make other “special exceptions.” That being said, many firms openly embrace lateral partners beyond the mandatory retirement age.




The drop-off in practicing attorneys from age 65 to age 70 is precipitous, especially compared to the U.S. overall population. One slightly confounding variable is the fact that 91.4 percent of partners over the age of 65 are male, who represent a lower percentage of the 65+ population.


Major Am Law 200 firms vary in their commitment to enforce mandatory retirement ages. Some firms take a strict approach to mandatory retirement, like Bradley Arant and Knobbe Martens, who have almost no attorneys over 65 years of age. On the other hand, Holland & Knight, Greenberg Traurig, Duane Morris, and K&L Gates tend to eschew the mandatory retirement requirement.

Promoting partners and associates to create a path to leadership positions, or rewarding them with lucrative client relationships, are efficient ways to seamlessly transfer responsibility to younger lawyers. At the same time, moving client relationships to younger partners also puts the firm at risk. Unless the firm feels the partner is loyal, or at least loyal enough, the firm may not want to transition the relationships too early in a partner’s career.

While the distribution of aging lawyers is trending upwards, firms may have to rethink their insistence on mandatory retirement and succession planning. Relying on a firm mandatory retirement deadline hurts both the lawyer and the firm, especially if there is no succession plan in place. Firms are wiser to ease the severity of the rule and instead impose a soft transition period on a case-by-case basis during which the lawyer could operate in a mentoring capacity to facilitate a smoother transfer of responsibility and relationships.

Executing a proper plan easily solves the dilemmas brought about by mandatory retirement. While identifying an aging leadership problem is helpful, creating and executing an actual plan is a necessity. If your firm needs to benchmark their leadership, or wishes to learn practices to cope with mandatory retirement,[ my colleagues](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/) at Lateral Link are happy to share their suggestions and help you craft a game plan based on their real experience with and knowledge of the Am Law 200 law firm market.

# Compensation Is Like A Box Of Chocolates At Top 40 Firm

There’s not a lot of mystery at the top of Biglaw. Firms must stick close to peer firms to avoid falling behind in the all-important tussle for talent.

So compensation is not like a box of chocolates over at Akin Gump, a firm that’s a lot like its namesake Forrest Gump. They both consistently hobnob with powerful political figures — Akin does it through its lobbying practice, while Forrest does it by getting shot in the buttocks.

Anyway, Akin mustered $1,231,343,000 in gross revenue last year to land at 40 on the Am Law charts.

The firm is matching the new normal. As a reminder that means…



Exceptional performers can get more. The folks off the grid will receive individualized comp.

But Akinites will have to wait just a tad longer than associates at other firms because the memo notes that while the salary bump is effective January 1, it’s not going to start hitting paychecks until February.

Looks like the holidays are going on plastic.

Please help us help you when it comes to salary news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Salary) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Salary”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.
