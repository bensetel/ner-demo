# Even With Individualized Bonuses, Associates At This Firm Are Raking It In
## No Memo, No Problem!

There may not be a formal memo announcing lockstep bonuses (boo!), but that doesn’t mean the associates at Gibson Dunn have been left out in the cold. As is their [usual tradition](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-this-prestigious-biglaw-firm-has-announced-its-bonuses/?rf=1), the firm gives out individualized bonuses communicated to associates in private review meetings. As is also their usual tradition, the amounts appear to track along the market bonus — with extra cash for particularly high performers.

As one tipster noted:

My understanding is that the firm is generally matching the market, with greater bonuses to high billers. I’m a third year who is receiving the market bonus of a fourth year, for hours billed in excess of 2300. Happy to receive above market bonuses for the extra hours billed!

# Profits Per Partner At ALL Law Firms That Have Not Raised Salaries For Associates
## Stop being so greedy, partners. It's time to spread the wealth!

Today is July 1, and at the vast majority of the hundred-plus law firms that have raised associate salaries (105 firms, to be exact), those raises are effective today. For associates at affected firms, it’s a wonderful way to kick off a three-day weekend. What better way to commemorate the Fourth of July than to celebrate your firm’s newfound independence from the $160K salary scale? For the rest of America’s associates whose firms are still enslaved to the once-prevailing but now under-market salary scale, it’s going to be yet another depressing weekend of working hard for a pittance of what their peers at other firms are now earning.

To this day, there are still hundreds of top-ranked law firms that have either refused to budge on compensation or remained completely silent as to their plans. Today, we will show you exactly which firms have failed to make a move with regard to base salaries for associates. This new listing includes each firm’s [most recent Am Law 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/) or [200 ranking](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-2016-am-law-200-revenue-swirling-down-the-drain/), [most recent Vault ranking](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/move-over-wachtell-theres-a-new-firm-at-the-top-vault-top-100-firms-2017/?rf=1), and most recently reported profits per partner. After almost a month of other firms’ partners spreading the wealth among their associates, if you see that your firm is listed here, then perhaps it’s time to consider a lateral move.

Do you like money? Of course you do, you’ve got student loans to pay off. Do you like prestige? Obviously, you’re a Type A law student. If you’re like the majority of your colleagues and you’d like to embark upon upon a career path that’ll pad your wallet and get you in on the ground floor at a prestigious firm, then you’ll probably want to compete for a job at a large firm.

[Law.com](https://www.law.com/2021/04/26/law-grads-hiring-report-job-stats-for-the-class-of-2020/) produced several helpful charts based on law school employment data for the class of 2020. Today, we will take a look at one of the more interesting charts, the law schools that sent the highest percentage of their most recent graduating class into large firms with 100 or more lawyers. On this list, you’ll find a dazzling array of law schools from the T14, but we’re not here to tell you what you already know — that graduates of top law schools get top jobs. That being said, we’re going to dive a little deeper into the list and highlight the schools you may not realize are some of the top large-firm contenders. Here they are for your viewing pleasure:

25. Howard University: 33.33%
39. Tulane University: 23.11%
45. Case Western Reserve University: 19.33%
47. Seton Hall University: 19.16%
48. University of Miami: 19.05%
49. University of Pittsburgh: 19.01%
50. St. Louis University: 18.99%
52. Wayne State University: 18.31%
53. Northeastern University: 18.00%
59. Loyola Marymount University-LA: 17.22%

Biglaw bonus season wouldn’t be complete without a look at what the Sullivan & Cromwell partners were gifting their associates. The task for S&C is always a little tricky since they don’t issue a firm-wide memo letting everyone know exactly what to expect in their stockings. Instead each employee gets this email, letting them know what they’re going to get, but they receive no information about what they can expect in future years, should they stay with the firm:

I’m happy to inform you that you can view your personal compensation information, including your year end 2017 bonus, by clicking the link below. The bonus will be paid Wednesday, December 20.

On behalf of the partners at S&C, I would like to thank you for all your hard work throughout the year.

Best wishes for a safe and joyous holiday season.

So it is left to Above the Law and our network of tipsters to piece together what the bigger picture at S&C looks like. Based on the flood of tips that came in, it looks like S&C has done… exactly what the rest of the Biglaw market has done, matching the bonus scale set by Cravath last month.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

What do the associates at S&C think about their bonuses? Well, the reaction is a little mixed, with some annoyed at how long it took to announce their bonuses:

No surprise, but people are miffed as to what took so long given Cravath and DPW announcing weeks ago. And it’s become a trend for S&C under the current regime.

Others are happy that the firm matched the market rate:

I’m not sure associates have been as busy as the past few years (at least in litigation) so nice to see bonus amounts not go down. Etc.

And still others are kinda right in the middle and “satisfied” by their bonuses:

I’m satisfied with the amount. More is always better, but associate compensation is at a good place. Also nice that they are paid out Dec. 20th.

The Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group just put out a summary of their 2019 year-end report and it’s no surprise to those of us following the quarterly reports throughout the year.

Revenue was up!

That’s probably where the firms would like you to stop reading the report. But you don’t even have to look deeply into the report to hear the ominous chords they play whenever someone on Chopped says, “I think I’ll just make this into a bread pudding.”

Revenue is up because clients are still willing to pay more. I guess it’s more fair to say “pay more eventually” given the collection issues. Folks, I’ve been writing this article for years now and it feels like the elasticity of client demand is reaching that point where Stretch Armstrong actually breaks. Clients are already dragging out collections and [imposing increasingly stupid rules to duck their bills](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/in-house-counsel-make-increasingly-arcane-billing-demands-and-its-costing-firms-money/), and you’ve got to wonder just how long this goes until the steep discounts they’re already demanding undermine the system.

The report also notes that equity partnership levels are holding steady while headcount is rising. These new lawyers have resulted in everyone working a little bit less which in a Dickensian sense is a sign that the firms have grown unnecessarily but in a human sense means people are vaguely remembering the names of their children. Leverage is leverage, but associates aren’t cheap — that’s the biggest bump in expense.

With reports already streaming in of [firms docking attorneys back whole class years on pay](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/stealth-layoffs-and-shortchanging-associates/), firms may already be gaming the system to get more for less. But this too becomes unsustainable at a certain point. If there’s a hiccup in the economy — and [law firm leaders are pretty sure there’s about to be](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/law-firm-leaders-think-its-about-time-to-completely-freak-out/) — things could get wild. Mergers, new tiers of associate pay, dissolutions… it’s all on the table.

# NY To $190K: What Should The New Biglaw Pay Scale Look Like?
## What should the new starting salary be, and how should pay rise with seniority?

It seems there’s some pessimism over when we’ll see that next Biglaw pay raise. In a [recent reader poll](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-if-not-now-when/), 36 percent of you predicted that it wouldn’t come until July 2017 or later, and another 25 percent voted “never.”

I think that’s too gloomy. Perhaps Biglaw associates are trying to manage their own expectations or not get their hopes too high, but I think the next salary hike will come much sooner. I stand by my prediction of the [first quarter of 2017](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-if-not-now-when/), but it could come even earlier. It’s certainly the case that associates want it to come earlier (and there will be a major morale boost when it does).

When the new law firm pay scale makes its debut, what will it look like? Here are two issues to consider:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
1. What will be the new starting salary? We’ve been using [NY to 190](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ny-to-190/), taken from the old [ATL comments](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-farewell-to-comments/) meme, as a convenient shorthand. But as we’ve stated before, we could easily see [NY to 180](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ny-to-180/) or NY to 200 (which happens to be the [starting salary at Williams & Connolly](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-who-pays-a-starting-salary-of-200000-williams-connolly/), the D.C. litigation powerhouse that competes with New York’s Biglaw behemoths for top talent; but note that W&C doesn’t pay bonuses).

If the starting salary goes from $160K to $180K, that would represent a 12.5 percent increase. Interestingly enough, that would basically reflect the rate of inflation between 2007 and 2016. According to the Department of Labor’s [inflation calculator](http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm), the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $160,000 in 2007 is $184,631 in 2016.

Going from $160K to $190K would represent an increase of 18.75 percent. That might seem sizable, but if you spread that growth out over almost a decade, you’re not talking that much more than inflation. And that’s nationwide inflation; the cost of living has increased at a much more rapid pace in New York, San Francisco, and other major cities (which would be the argument in favor of going to $200K, a nice round 25 percent increase).

Could we see a small raise, say, $160K to $170K? It’s possible, although I think it unlikely. A $10,000 raise just seems like a waste of everyone’s time. Recall that the last raise, from $145K to $160K, was $15,000. To raise by $10,000 on a larger base makes for an even smaller raise in percentage terms.

2. How will salaries increase with seniority? When I’ve had conversations with folks about a possible Biglaw pay hike, I’ve gotten the most pushback on a raise for first- and second-year associates. If junior associates aren’t very knowledgeable or efficient (or profitable), why should they see their salaries go up? Especially when there are thousands of law school graduates who would kill for Biglaw jobs?

(Note: I don’t completely buy that second point. The market for entry-level talent in the legal profession is somewhat bifurcated, and the top law firms compete eagerly for the top law students from the top law schools. The fact that thousands of graduates of low-ranked law schools would love Biglaw jobs is irrelevant to the hiring calculus at Sullivan & Cromwell or Davis Polk.)

At the same time, as any legal recruiter can tell you, good midlevel and senior associates remain in high demand. Yes, the Biglaw model [relies on a certain amount of associate attrition](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/plowing-through-associates-and-proud-of-it/) — but at some firms, there has been a bit too much attrition. Part of this talent shortage in the midlevel and senior ranks, by the way, is arguably the firms’ own fault — when you fire [almost 10,000 junior and midlevel lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/6-tips-for-smarter-lateral-hiring/), as Biglaw did during the recession, don’t expect them to magically be there when you want them as midlevel and senior lawyers.

So what does this mean for the next Biglaw pay scale? Larger jumps as you go higher in seniority, in an effort to retain midlevel and senior associates. In other words, instead of raising everyone’s salaries by a uniform $30,000 over the current [Simpson Thacher scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/), we could see senior lawyers get larger step increases. Here are two sample scales, one involving fixed bump-ups of $30,000 per class year and one involving bump-ups of increasing size as you go up the seniority tree:



These are just examples. The bumps could be smaller or bigger. The main issue is whether there will be fixed increases or variable increases. Again, tell us your thoughts:

What will the new Biglaw pay scale look like?

- There will be a uniform increase across the board.
- The pay raises will increase with seniority.

Biglaw firms across the country continue to hand out special bonuses to associates and counsel as a way to thank them for their dedication during the pandemic — and to keep them around amid an incredibly hot lateral market. Other firms are going a step further and instituting salary increases, raising those in major markets to the standard Biglaw salary scale (if they weren’t already there), and others in smaller markets by tens of thousands of dollars.

Following DLA Piper’s decision earlier this spring to [increase base pay for associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/alston-bird-special-bonus-2021/?rf=1) in some offices, a handful of other firms have followed in the firm’s footsteps, and now yet another has fallen in line.

According to emails sent by management earlier this week at Ice Miller, an Am Law 200 firm, effective July 1, 2021, all full-time associates and partner-track counsel will receive at least a $20,000 raise.

In terms of bonuses, sources say the the firm has announced that they’ll be capped because “we want people to have a little balance in their lives and don’t want to encourage more than 2,200 hours.” This is what bonuses at each of Ice Miller’s offices will look like in 2021:



Congratulations to everyone at the firm who just got a big raise, and congratulations to everyone who will be receiving bigger bonuses. Associates are quite happy, and this is something we absolutely love to see.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus or raise news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I don’t think we’re going to see a domino effect here. Firms are making their own decisions in terms of what works for their culture. If Skadden increased salaries, everyone else would fall in line. So this is a different issue.

— [Michelle Fivel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-fivel-41b6293/), recruiter and co-founder of Hatch Henderson Fivel, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/08/shifting-big-law-power-dynamics-pave-way-for-more-4-day-attendance-policies/) on the decisions made by Skadden and Davis Polk to institute a mandatory four-day in-office attendance policy, and why other firms might not rush to follow them. “One reason why firms are doing this right now is they’re holding power over associates,” she said. According to [Am Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/08/shifting-big-law-power-dynamics-pave-way-for-more-4-day-attendance-policies/), the following firms have not (yet) expressed a sense of urgency when it comes to adopting a four-day in-office attendance policy: Fried Frank; Debevoise; Cahill; and Paul Weiss.

# ChatGPT Has Pretty Depressing Thoughts About Biglaw And The Billable Hour
## The AI bot really seems to understand the plight of associates.

For years now, lawyers have been told that the robots were coming for their jobs. Of course, that warning was largely ignored, with many shrugging it off as technobabble nonsense. Come on, let’s be serious. How could a robot replace a lawyer?

Well, now that an artificial intelligence bot exists that can not only [score well enough on law school exams](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/it-turns-out-chatgpt-wouldnt-be-the-best-law-student/) to make it to graduation, but can also [pass the bar exam](https://www.lawnext.com/2023/01/on-lawnext-podcast-can-the-ai-of-gpt-3-5-pass-the-bar-exam-we-find-out.html), lawyers are starting to get a little worried.

ChatGPT may be ready to be a lawyer, but is it ready to work in Biglaw? Would the chatbot be able to hack it in such a high-pressure environment? To find out, we asked ChatGPT to write a poem about the Biglaw experience and the billable hour. The result a little too human but at least associates know that their new robot overlord already feels their pain.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The clock ticks on, as hours fly by,
A constant race, with no time to sigh.

Two thousand hours, a year’s demand,
A looming task, that’s hard to withstand.

The days are long, the nights are short,
A constant hustle, with no time to sort.

Each hour tracked, each task assigned,
A pressure to bill, that’s always on the grind.

The bonus in sight, a carrot to chase,
A constant push, with no time to pace.

But with every hour, comes a cost,
Of time and energy, that’s forever lost.

Family and friends, fade into the past,
As work consumes, all that we have.

We strive for success, with no end in sight,
But at what cost, this constant fight?

We’ll look back and wonder, if it was worth the price,
Of a life consumed, by the never-ending grind of Biglaw, and a life of sacrifice.

# Let The Good(win) Times Roll For These Associates Getting Raises
## Another Biglaw firm joins the $190K scale.

As you may have guessed, this post is about Goodwin Procter, who is joining the ranks of the $190K salary scale with an announcement moments ago. It’s a full match, including summer bonuses and an adjustment to summer associate salaries.

This certainly isn’t surprising, but it’s nice to let the associates know before they sweat out another weekend wondering.

The best news in the memo may be for counsel — the often overlooked attorneys in a salary bonanza. Goodwin’s memo doesn’t lay out salaries at that level, but promises more news in the very near future. Kudos to Goodwin for taking the time to let these senior attorneys know they are still appreciated. And even though the new numbers didn’t arrive with the counsel figures, Goodwin pledges to make any change effective July 1 as well.

# The Billable Hour Is Dead. Long Live The Billable Hour.

The billable hour has been the bane of attorneys’ existence for a long time. Even when I entered the industry 20 years ago, the billable hour was ‘dead.’ Well, it’s not dead. It’s always the way firms are going to make their money.

— Michelle Fivel, a partner at Major, Lindsey & Africa who worked at multiple Biglaw firms before becoming a recruiter,[ tells Law.com](https://www.law.com/2022/01/04/how-can-big-law-fix-its-biggest-problems/) the industry’s reckoning with the billable hour is a long time coming. Fivel also noted the impact this dependency has on equality, “You’re only as good as the number of hours you’ve billed. That ties people to the profession in ways where men have more than women. I’d like to see the playing field leveled for women. I just don’t think it is. And I suspect that as long as the billable hour is king, it’ll always be unlevel.”

What could possibly be better than bonus news? Even more of it!

Yet another Biglaw firm has announced special bonuses, and this time, it’s none other than Ropes & Gray, a firm that brought in $1,903,616,000 gross revenue in 2019, placing it at No. 13 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. What does Ropes have in store for associates and counsel in terms of their spring bonus hauls?

It’s a Davis Polk match, of course. Here’s what the scale looks like at the firm:



Ropes & Gray took the time to acknowledge that while all of this money is nice, that’s not all that associates and counsel at the firm should be focused on. “We ask that you continue to recognize the need to keep your minds and bodies healthy and that you take the time to recharge whenever possible,” the firm’s memo reads.

Bonus money at the firm will be paid out on April 30 and in late December. What a wonderful way to end the week. Congratulations to all!

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/ropes-gray-special-bonus-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Ropes & Gray.)

# From Brooklyn To Silicon Valley, Founder And Berkeley Law Alum Rukayatu Tijani Is Charting Her Own Course

Rukayatu Tijani

“Give me my check, put some respect on my check / Or pay me in equity / Watch me reverse out of debt.” — [Beyoncé](https://genius.com/14800213)

This week, I had the opportunity to catch up with [Rukayatu Tijani](https://pipelinetopractice.org/rukayatu-tijani-esq/), a former Quinn Emanuel associate and recent law firm founder. I first met Tijani a few years ago while serving on the [Pipeline to Practice Foundation](https://pipelinetopractice.org/board/) board.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Last November, Tijani decided to embark on the journey of entrepreneurship and founded [Firm for the Culture](http://firmfortheculture.com/). In accordance with my [New Year’s resolution](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/20-things-top-of-mind-in-2020/?rf=1) — of speaking with more attorneys on the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of their legal journeys — I was thrilled with the opportunity to cover Tijani’s journey from Brooklyn to the Valley, and from law school to entrepreneurship, for our audience.

Tijani’s passion and purpose are evident to anyone who has met or has been represented by her. And her advice to those who are thinking about Biglaw or hanging their own shingle is both inspiring and instructive. As she recently relayed to [Pipeline to Practice](https://pipelinetopractice.org/rukayatu-tijani-esq/):

In the projects of Brooklyn, New York, you quickly grow accustomed to choosing your battles. Some battles, frankly, can get you killed — speaking back to the wrong group of folks can set you up to become a target. So you learn to pick your words and actions wisely. This practical wisdom has helped me immensely as an attorney. In the high stakes world of litigation, every interaction with opposing counsel seems like a battle you want to fight to the death. But the most skilled lawyers know when to fight and when to simply fold; they concede some victories to win the ultimate war. I continue to see this strategy at play from the partners I work with; I hope to emulate this tried and true principal as well.

Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): Congratulations on the founding of your firm, Firm for the Culture, in November 2019. What prompted this move from Quinn Emanuel? 

Rukayatu Tijani (RT): I will forever be grateful for the amazing experience I had at Quinn Emanuel.  As the famous Quinn mantra says, there is truly “No Firm Like Ours.” But it’s funny how purpose chases you down. Since I was five years old, I knew I wanted to be an attorney.

And as I grew, my purpose grew with me. Purpose, which had been molded and shaped by my experiences at Quinn Emanuel and my Federal Judicial Clerkship, now required me to do something different. Something more. Something entirely out of alignment with the status quo. So I listened. And I built Firm for the Culture — an innovative virtual law firm designed to help social entrepreneurs trademark their brands as they scale their social impact.

And I’m excited to witness the immense impact the Firm will make.

RC: What inspired you to become an attorney and how did you choose Berkeley Law?

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
RT: The road to lawyerdom was pretty “interesting” for this Brooklyn girl, ha ha. I grew up in the projects of Brooklyn, N. Y., where there was often more “month” than “money.” Against this backdrop, it was audacious to want to be a lawyer. But the story of Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP encouraged me to live boldly and to make this goal for myself. In learning about the long arduous journey to what would eventually become Brown v. Board, my curious young mind latched onto the idea that I too could use the law to change the world.

Berkeley Law understood that. I chose Berkeley because of its amazing reputation for social impact, social justice, and intellectual rigor. It was not uncommon for my classmates and I to discuss intersectional feminism while studying torts. Berkeley Law encouraged me to always think of my place in the real world while I pursued greatness in the ivory tower.

I am a proud Golden Bear.

RC: As a first-generation law student and a second-generation American, any advice for others — who are new to the legal universe or whose families are new to this country — who are thinking about a career in law?

RT: I run an organization called the First Generation Purpose Project, which is an amazing initiative designed to help First Gen Professionals navigate corporate America, entrepreneurship, and life by utilizing the grit and tenacity that is already on the inside of them. In this capacity, I often tell my First Gen Rockstars this: you may be the first in your family to think a certain way, the first in your family to walk a certain way.

You may find yourself in the “in between,” in between the person you used to be and the person you’re meant to be. But keep going. Keep asking questions. Keep building community around you. Keep growing. Because there’s purpose attached to your journey.

RC: Can you share a bit about your law clerk experience with [The Honorable Kimberly Mueller in the Eastern District of California](http://www.caed.uscourts.gov/caednew/index.cfm/judges/all-judges/5020/) from September 2015 to September 2017?

RT: A clerkship is an amazing opportunity to understand the inner workings of the court. And it’s hard work. My judge encouraged us to uphold a spirit of excellence with each case we received, including cases brought pro se. My judge also emphasized importance in making legal writing “accessible.” She’d say things like “because our case is for the public at large, it should be understood by the public at large.”

My clerkship also encouraged me to see myself as a powerful contributor to the law.  Subject to my judge’s decision, of course, my research and writing played an enormous role in a case outcome. Inner-chambers advocacy mattered. My thoughts mattered. My writings mattered. My clerkship really helped me understand all this and more.

RC: What advice do you have for others who are thinking about Biglaw or starting their own firm?

RT: Biglaw far too often gets a bad rap. Now, I’ll be the first to concede that Biglaw still has a way to go in terms of diversity and other equitable practices. But Biglaw has also been at the forefront of some of most monumental changes in our country.

It was in Biglaw that I helped draft an amicus curiae brief for Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark Supreme Court case extending the right of marriage to same-sex couples. And it is because of Biglaw that I have a work ethic that can hardly be beat.

To anyone coming into Biglaw, I’d encourage you to get really clear on the impact you want to make while you’re there. It’s great if you want to become a partner. And it’s totally fine if you have something else in mind. But having a sense of self and building support around this will be the touchstone of success in an institution as powerful as Biglaw.

For people starting their own law firm? Ha ha. Come back to me in a year and I’ll be happy to share more wisdom with you.  The only advice I have right now is community, community, community. Have a powerful community of people and advocates. When I considered starting my firm, I found support in relationships with brilliant women like Ticora Davis, Kimberly Bennett, and Sonia Lakhany. When you’re around women like them, it’s hard to believe you can’t soar, ha ha.

RC: How would you compare New York and California?

RT: Unfair question! Comparing New York and California is like comparing apples and oranges. I am a different person in each place, if I am being honest. I go to bodegas to talk to papi and dine at Caribbean food joints in New York. I go hiking, eat way too many avocados, and drink lots of green juice in California. And I feel like myself in each experience. I truly feel like I’m exposed to the best of both worlds. Because of this, I decided to take the bar in both states, ha ha.

Brooklyn is home. Cali is my love. And I’m grateful for both.

RC: What are you looking most forward to in 2020?

RT: More impact with Firm for the Culture. We have an exciting year lined up and I cannot wait to start working. I look forward to trademarking the brands of some of the biggest and most innovative social impact organizations and entrepreneurs in the world. I look forward to making intellectual property protection accessible to diverse founders.

I look forward to sharing more trademark tips on my Instagram, speaking at more conferences, writing more articles about the benefits of trademark protection, and stewarding my relationships with friends and family.

RC: Why is Firm for the Culture specifically aimed at social entrepreneurs?

RT: Social entrepreneurs are in a unique position to shift culture, and I want to support them in any way I can. According to the [Stanford Social Innovation Review](https://ssir.org/why_purpose_why_now), “[n]early two-thirds of Americans believe companies should take the lead in driving social and environmental change,” and the new businesses of today are building their companies to address this.

Additionally, as a millennial, I am witnessing first-hand how my colleagues want more from the workplace than a fancy title and a paycheck.  I felt heard when I read the [Deloitte Global Millennial Survey of 2019](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/millennialsurvey.html), which stated, in part, that “millennials and Gen Zs [tend to] start and stop relationships with companies for [reasons . . . often] related to a company’s positive or negative impact on society.” And we also are more likely to leave positions of power if we feel we can make a more positive impact on society.

As a social impact entrepreneur and attorney, my goal is to make sure businesses that seek to change the world are well positioned for investments by having a robust intellectual property portfolio, and are less vulnerable to lawsuit because of trademark infringement.

RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

RT: If you’re an organization with social impact as one of your bottom lines, you’re our ideal client.

# Get Ready For A Biglaw Exodus
## A lot of associates are ready to leave their firms.
By [Kathryn Rubino](https://abovethelaw.com/author/krubino/)

Shares[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/get-ready-for-a-biglaw-exodus/&text=Get%20Ready%20For%20A%20Biglaw%20Exodus)[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/get-ready-for-a-biglaw-exodus/&display=popup&ref=plugin&src=share_button)[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/get-ready-for-a-biglaw-exodus/)[](javascript:void(""#ea-share-count-email""))
Twenty five percent of Biglaw associates are getting ready to leave their firms within the next year. This revelation is from a [new report](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/insights/research/to-retain-top-associates-firms-need-to-put-their-people-first) by Major, Lindsey & Africa. Their survey of ~300 Biglaw associates showed that 1 in 4 are planning their exit and three out of five associates said their firms aren’t trying to actively retain them.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2023/10/10/1-in-4-big-law-associates-plan-to-leave-within-the-year/) Law.com, Biglaw should expect an uptick in lateral moves:

Although a tough hiring market in some practices has stalled lateral movement, temporarily aiding retention, MLA associate recruiter and report co-author Kate Reder Sheikh said Big Law firms shouldn’t be lulled into a false sense of security.
“Firms have been, on a numerical basis, able to retain even more associates than they bargained for because the market has been down. But since Q2, things have been better in the markets where I recruit,” said Reder Sheikh, referencing the San Francisco Bay Area and Colorado. “These issues are more alive than they were in the first six months of the year.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Reder Sheikh also pointed to the practice areas that are hot right now, “I’m starting to see M&A roles come back, general corporate, not a ton of emerging companies and venture capital but they are really in a winter right now,” she said. “But certainly litigation is gangbusters, white collar, labor and employment—a lot of practices are doing very well.”

But if this is alarming to Biglaw leadership, well, they only have to make an effort. A whopping 90 percent of respondents said they’d be be more likely to stay if they felt like their firms are making a conscious effort to keep them. So, ball’s in Biglaw’s court.

# Another Biglaw Firm Rolls Out Most Excellent Special Bonuses
## This is the standard for truly elite Biglaw firms.

More and more firms are getting in on the special bonus action. After over a year of pandemic life, Biglaw is showing love for the associates (and their billable hours) that make the success of the industry all possible.

Today, Fried Frank, a firm that place 56th on the Am Law 200 thanks to $776,000,000 in gross revenue in 2019, announced its own special bonuses. As expected for such an elite firm, they’re matching the standard set by Davis Polk.

At Fried Frank, the two special bonus payments are split equally, which is a nice touch. The billable-hour threshold for the bonuses is 1850, annualized, and associates who miss out on the first payment have an opportunity to catch up if they bill the requisite hours in the back half of the year.

# Metrics? What Metrics? KPIs That Legal Ops Professionals Need To Track (Part I)

I’ve been working with people in legal operations for about 20 years now. Of course, most of my career has been on the law firm side, so I don’t claim to have an insider’s view of all the trappings of Fortune 500 legal departments. But I have experience as part of the legal team at outside counsel working with legal operations personnel. It’s not a stretch at all to gain understanding of how the relationship between inside and outside counsel works.

The truth is that some legal departments are more advanced than others. Whether it be technology, access to resources, or just the structure and budget of the department. At the end of the day, however, legal departments are pretty similar. I mean, the role of general counsel exists to provide legal advice and guidance to the business and its leaders and to help manage exposure to risk in general and legal liability in particular. Businesses need legal advisors who understand that business and they need legal operations personnel to support the mission.

The interesting thing to me has always been that what legal departments are missing is tons of legal talent, namely lawyers, to handle all of their legal work. Anyone who’s been paying attention over the past few years can deduce that more work is moving in-house. It’s an open question, I think, and I’m not sure an equal number of lawyers have moved in-house to handle the increased workload. So, where does this leave us?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In this situation, I see three options: First, corporations can hire more legal talent. Second, they can rely more heavily on lawyers at outside counsel. And third, they can simply do more with less. My sense is that, at least in the short term, many organizations will choose the third option, and this means there’s some work to be done.

I don’t remember who said it first, but there’s a well-known premise in operations that posits, “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.” In the project management circles in which I am known to roam, we use estimates, projections, and tons of post-project metrics to measure whether a project is on track and whether it’s actually achieved a successful outcome. It should be no different when managing a legal matter.

At the risk of oversimplifying the complexity of the work that goes into a legal matter, I have to say that almost all legal actions, cases, investigations, and even transactions, each involve a similar pattern of tasks, activities, and events each time a new matter arises. This is not to say that the work of lawyers is commoditized and simple; clearly, it’s not. It’s just an observation that anyone working in the legal business should recognize. And having made this observation, it is not unrealistic to make the leap from legal work to project management. My point: If you are leading a case, you are managing a project.

And if you’re managing a project properly, you’re benchmarking, you’re measuring, you’re budgeting, you have deadlines, and you’re concerned with the quality of the work. And if you’re doing this in-house, you’re also concerned about the business value of the work, ongoing operations, and validating the success of the project.

Traditional project management metrics relating to scope, time, cost, and quality are important in defining the success of a project. More recent thinking has evolved suggesting that project success should also be measured by considering project objectives. Now, many stakeholders may disagree on what successful completion of a project looks like. It’s somewhat subjective and it’s going to be different for different organizations. That’s why it is critical to define success up front and clearly identify project objectives that are measurable.

At the outset of a matter, then, it makes sense to ask “What does success look like?” and “How will success be measured?” With these two simple questions, legal operations professionals can identify from the beginning what matters most to their organization, how the objectives align with the business, and the value of the outcome to business operations.

Next week, we will take a look at some of the metrics organizations should be measuring to determine the success of their legal projects.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Rolls Out Incredible Bonus-Eligible Time-Off Policy
## Wow. Kudos to this firm for taking mental health seriously.

Thanks to the pandemic, it’s been a year since lawyers were forced to leave the comforts of their offices and adapt to working from home on a semi-permanent basis. The thought of working from home used to be seen as a somewhat of a luxury, but after doing it for 12 months straight, it’s become simply exhausting. When your home is your office and your office is your home, the concept of work-life balance is no more, especially for lawyers who thought they were always “on” even before the coronavirus crisis. One firm has come up with an amazing solution for this problem.

Orrick — a firm that brought in $1,158,537,000 in 2019 gross revenue, placing in at No. 31 in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings — is offering everyone (i.e., staff, associates, of counsel, career associates, and partners) the chance to truly “unplug.” The firm will credit 40 hours of bonus-eligible time for everyone to sit back, relax, and stop doing work. Here’s an excerpt from the Orrick memo announcing this fantastic policy (available in full on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/top-50-biglaw-firm-rolls-out-incredible-bonus-eligible-time-off-policy/2)):

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Many Biglaw firms talk a good game about mental health and wellness, but Orrick is the first firm that we know of to offer bonus-eligible hours dedicated to taking time off work. If anything, the firm’s new policy is like the opposite of what Biglaw is known for, and Orrick should be commended for offering its employees a way to care for themselves without having to worry about work for once.

The firm also noted in the memo announcing its “Unplug Time” policy that it will be expanding its caregivers program beyond the first quarter of 2021. If you recall, Orrick offered a special program for lawyers who have also worked as family caretakers (for children, elderly parents, or both) during the pandemic, allowing associates and of counsel to work an 80 percent schedule at full compensation. Employees who took this benefit will be able to continue to do so, returning to full-time work as vaccines and caretaking resources become available.

Last, but certainly not least, Orrick is also instituting a “Focused Fridays” program, where non-essential meetings are discouraged so that employees can have time to get their work done during the work week and actually enjoy their weekends.

It’s also worth noting that while promoting these positive work-life balance policies, Orrick also announced its plans to reopen its offices. In June, the firm will relax its office access, and allow those who wish to return to do so. In September, the firm hopes to fully reopen its offices, noting that those who are able to do their jobs remotely will not be required to return to the office five days a week.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Alexa, Play ‘Celebration’ By Kool & The Gang: Why The Job Hunt/Candidate Search Is Not The Time To Play It Cool
## Showing your excitement in this process can make all the difference, from both the candidate and employer perspectives.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/06/AdobeStock_177640476-scaled.jpeg)As a legal recruiter, I’ve seen candidates reject an offer from what they thought was their first choice firm because another firm showed more enthusiasm to have them on their team. Likewise, I’ve seen clients reject highly credentialed and qualified candidates who didn’t seem to show a genuine interest or excitement in the firm’s practice. In many ways, showing your enthusiasm for a position is just as important as the experience, qualifications, and skills you bring to a job interview. Similarly, showing a candidate who you’re interested in that you’re… well, interested in them can help you land a quality candidate. Showing your excitement in this process can make all the difference, from both the candidate and employer perspectives.

While it might sound obvious that it’s important to show enthusiasm in the job hunt process, or similarly while you’re searching for a candidate, it can be overlooked and it can cost you. Here are some sure-fire ways that you can show your excitement and help seal the deal:

##As a candidate, you can:
1. Be prepared for the interview.

Familiarize yourself with their practice, ask meaningful questions, and let the employer know why you are interested in them specifically. We’ve had candidates who had the exact background requested by the client, but they were not asked back for a second interview because they didn’t know enough about what the company/practice group does. The questions you ask should be informed and specific, and not something you can discover through a quick review of the company’s/firm’s website.

2. Tell them that you are excited.

It seems simple enough, but very few people do it. At the end of the interview, you can say, “I’m really excited about this opportunity, and I think it could be a great fit. What are the next steps?” It really is that simple.

3. Send a thank you email.

A handwritten note, while a nice touch, is no longer necessary. Hiring decisions are often made before a handwritten note would arrive (and with hybrid schedules, the recipient may not even be in the office to receive it). A few sentences in an email reiterating your interest will do the trick. This can also work as a nudge to get the partners talking and get you your offer!

##As an employer, you can:
1. Be prepared for the interview (yep, this goes both ways!).

Review their resume ahead of time, and be engaged in the process. I’ve had candidates report after an interview that a partner had clearly not looked at their resume until the moment the interview started. I’ve also heard of partners working (and once, even working out!) during their video interviews. The lack of engagement was obviously not well-received, and when the firms requested additional interviews or came back with an offer, they were ultimately declined.

2. Move quickly.

Great candidates will not stay on the market for long! If the duration of your company’s hiring process is outside your control, make sure to keep the candidate engaged along the way and give them reassurances that you are excited about them so that they are less inclined to start considering other options. I’ve had clients that schedule interviews as soon as they receive a good resume, and will make offers the same day when interviews go well. On the flip side, I’ve had clients that accept resumes weeks before scheduling interviews and take weeks, and sometimes even months, to complete the interview process. Inevitably, the candidates they like the most are no longer available or accept another offer by the time they get around to getting their offer out.

3. Have the person who they will be reporting to call to extend the offer.

Candidates are much more excited to hear it from you, rather than an HR person or recruiter. Once the written offer goes out, HR/recruiting can assist to answer any questions.

Lastly, a note to both candidates and employers – the offer and acceptance don’t have to be a negotiation. If you, as an employer, are excited about a candidate, your first offer should be your best offer – this is the last chance to show the candidate how much you want them on board. Similarly, as a candidate, if you are excited about the opportunity, you can accept on the spot.

A job interview is not just about asking a candidate the right questions or answering an interviewer with a smart response. The hiring process is the first step in building a relationship with a potential employer/employee and a glimpse into the mutual cultural fit. The best way to start a new position is with both parties having shown their enthusiasm throughout the process. Enthusiasm speaks for itself and like all emotions, it’s contagious so go ahead and spread the excitement.

# T-Minus 7 Days Until BakerHostetler Gets Their Raise Game In Order

Many BakerHostetler associates have written in complaining that we continue to count BakerHostetler among the ranks of firms that have raised salaries. It’s a fair complaint, but it’s worth noting that we are doing so provisionally.

In [our original post](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/firm-finally-announces-raises-some-offices-miss-the-cravath-scale/), we pointed out that the announcement tips we received were entirely tentative. Basically, we received a few detailed tips that raises of some kind would be coming to bring the firm into line with the market in major offices, but that all details would be hashed out at an upcoming July 15 partner meeting.

So we really don’t know anything about BakerHostetler except an expressed intent to do… something. Is this going to be a $180K and screw the seniors sort of raise? A full match? A partial match in a few offices? We will find out after this meeting next week. We have reason to believe it’s closer to the first option, if only because this best mirrors where BakerHostetler was under ye olde $160K scale, but frankly they could blow up everything next week.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
On the occasion of this countdown, we remind BakerHostetler that by putting a target on July 15, now everyone’s watching. There’s been plenty more water under the associate salary bridge since we first got our clutch of tips. Some firms are making it tempting to water down salaries and brace for lateral impact. And that’s all well and good for those firms.

But does BakerHostetler want to be one of those firms?

(And, yes, I realize the title probably should be “D-Minus 7 Days” but people are so much more familiar with “T-Minus.”)

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Better late than never. It’s the motto of the post office and sexually active teens everywhere. It’s also the phrase percolating throughout the halls of WilmerHale’s offices, as one of the higher-profile holdouts in the MoneyLaw wars comes into the fold.

WilmerHale announced a new salary structure today, and it follows the Cravath scale up through $315K. You’ll note that WilmerHale is unique in that it doesn’t actually have associates beyond sixth years, instead moving the next rung to counsel status. We haven’t heard a lot about counsel compensation yet — what we have we are gathering into a future post — but at least we have a sense of what they’re getting here.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The raises apply across WilmerHale’s U.S. offices, which, as a refresher, include New York, Boston, Washington, Los Angeles, Palo Alto, and Denver. So now there’s some pressure in the Denver market of all places.

Congratulations!

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Mammas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Litigators

A litigator crying on the courthouse steps? (via Getty Images)

Litigators are my people. Back when I practiced law, I litigated. Many of my friends and contacts in the legal profession are litigators. I’m obsessed with [judges](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/21/scotus-watch) and [law clerks](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/08/books/david-lats-supreme-ambitions-is-a-thriller-for-lawyers.html), and they’re almost all litigators. I’m married to a litigator.

And I must confess that when I was a practicing litigator, I held transactional types in a vague sort of disdain. They’re not real lawyers, I’d think to myself; they’re just handmaidens to bankers, lackeys of corporate executives, functionaries who “paper up” deals negotiated by others.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

One can understand how such prejudices develop. Depictions of lawyers in popular culture — in books like To Kill A Mockingbird, movies like My Cousin Vinny, and television shows like Perry Mason — focus on litigators. The lawyers we lionize as historical heroes — Clarence Darrow, Thurgood Marshall, Ruth Bader Ginsburg — tend to be litigators. Law school, driven by the [case-method model](https://casestudies.law.harvard.edu/the-case-study-teaching-method/) of legal education, teaches law in a litigation-centric way.

But now, with the benefit of two decades of working in and around the legal profession, I have reached a different view. First, deal lawyers are very much “real lawyers.” They are the lawyers who allow individuals and entities to grow and flourish, enabled and protected by the rule of the law. They are the lawyers who help people buy homes, launch businesses, raise money for those businesses, and invent new products, secure in the knowledge that their interests are protected.

Second, from the perspective of an individual law student or lawyer, if you have to pick, you’re better off working as a transactional lawyer than as a litigator. In other words, with apologies to [Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammas_Don%27t_Let_Your_Babies_Grow_Up_to_Be_Cowboys), “Mammas, don’t let your babies grow up to be litigators.”

Okay, that’s a bit exaggerated. Working as a litigator can still be a very satisfying and successful career. If you love advocacy, written and oral, and want to pursue a career in litigation, then by all means, go for it. Our society needs talented trial lawyers and litigators, attorneys to protect the legal rights of everyone from immigrants and the indigent to Fortune 500 companies and high-net-worth individuals.

So here’s what I will say, a far more modest claim: if you’re a law student or young lawyer who is choosing between practice areas and really can’t decide, and you’re focused on pragmatic considerations such as compensation and career prospects, then pick corporate or transactional work over litigation. If you can’t stand reading contracts and you love writing legal briefs, then of course you should litigate. But if you don’t feel such a calling to litigation, finding yourself equally drawn to corporate law and the courtroom, then the tie should go to transactional practice.

Why? Here are three reasons (admittedly Biglaw-focused, but Above the Law, despite its expansion into the in-house and small-firm realms, is still Biglaw-centric).

1. Biglaw and corporate legal departments are run by transactional lawyers, not litigators.

Putting to one side litigation-focused or litigation-only firms like Boies Schiller and Quinn Emanuel (of which there are just a handful), the Am Law 200 and Vault 100 law firms are dominated by corporate lawyers and driven by corporate work. At the vast majority of so-called “full-service” firms, the services that bring in the biggest bucks — and carry the greatest clout, because in Biglaw, money equals power — are practices like mergers and acquisitions (M&A), finance, and private equity (PE).

Are you an associate aspiring to make partner, a partner aspiring to enter firm management, or an in-house lawyer aspiring to become the general counsel? You’ll have a much easier time doing so as a transactional lawyer than as a litigator.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Over time, this orientation toward the corporate within Biglaw has only increased. Firms that were once viewed as “litigation shops,” such as Kirkland & Ellis, are now dominated by their M&A and PE practices. And even firms still known for their litigation strength, such as Paul Weiss, have seen greater growth in recent years on the transactional side of the house.

2. Opportunities for transactional lawyers are better and broader than those for litigators, both within Biglaw and beyond.

Now that I’ve been working for a while [as a legal recruiter](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/a-departure-memo-from-david-lat-leaving-abovethelaw-joining-lateral-link/), I have been struck by the vast disparity in the market demand for litigators versus corporate lawyers. There are excellent opportunities for elite litigators, who have become a specialization of mine — I have had success placing litigators who graduated from top schools, clerked for top judges, and worked at top firms — but overall, lateral opportunities for transactional attorneys vastly outnumber lateral opportunities for litigators.

This varies depending on the state of the economy, of course, and right now the robust deal market is fueling demand for corporate lawyers across a wide range of specialties. When the markets turn, this demand will subside, and the market for litigators might pick up, since litigation is somewhat countercyclical. But a “hot” market for litigators never gets nearly as hot as a hot market for corporate lawyers.

And when it comes to life beyond Biglaw — i.e., exit opportunities — it has long been the case that transactional types enjoy more and better options than litigators, even in down economies.

If you’re a Biglaw litigation associate looking to leave, your main options are going to be another firm, government, or in-house (and the universe of in-house litigation jobs is limited). In contrast, Biglaw corporate associates go all over the place. They might, and often do, wind up at other law firms. But they also go to banks, hedge funds, or private equity firms — sometimes in legal roles, sometimes not. They venture beyond the financial world to join other types of corporations as in-house counsel, since there actually are a decent number of in-house jobs for corporate attorneys. They move into pure business roles for corporations, or they launch businesses of their own. The experience of a transactional attorney is much more transferable, to a wider range of outside fields, than the experience of a litigator.

3. People “like” their transactional attorneys more than their litigators.

Okay, this is a bit tongue-in-cheek. It’s hard to account for taste in people, and if anything, the stereotype is that litigators (or at least trial lawyers) are fun and funny, with larger-than-life personalities, while corporate lawyers are more staid, even a bit boring.

But here’s what I will say, which I do think is fair: clients generally have more positive associations with their deal lawyers than with their litigators, and clients are happier to hear from their deal lawyers than from their litigators.

And this makes perfect sense. Clients go to their transactional attorneys to get things done, generally of a positive nature — e.g., to incorporate a new business, to raise additional capital, or to execute a transaction. In contrast, clients go to their litigators because something bad has happened — e.g., they’ve been taken advantage of by a counterparty, harmed by a competitor, or charged by the government. As a result, litigators often see people at their worst. Clients who turn to litigators are often under a great amount of stress — and these clients are often not much fun to deal with.

(Now, there is a flip side to this. When a litigator achieves a great result for a client — keeping that client out of prison, allowing that client to maintain custody of a child, saving that client from a ruinous judgment — the gratitude can be hard to match. Litigators can literally save their clients’ lives — think of defense attorneys in capital cases — whereas that can’t really be said of transactional attorneys.)

Please don’t get me wrong: I love litigators, I always will, and I’m grateful to live in a society where litigators are available to protect me, whether from individual or government wrongdoing. As I said at the outset, litigators are — and always will be — my people.

But what I will say now, as someone older and wiser than I was as a law clerk or junior associate, is that I deeply respect, admire, and enjoy dealing with transactional attorneys. There might not be many fictional depictions of them, but the work that they do is very real — and the careers that they enjoy, while perhaps less heralded than those of litigators, are no less satisfying.

P.S. I’m always happy to hear from lawyers from all different types of backgrounds, but I’m especially eager to expand my network of corporate associates and partners at top firms.

# Pregnant In Biglaw? Here's The Bad News
## ""I felt totally disrespected while I was pregnant.""

The quest to have it all does not come easy. The hours and stress of Biglaw are challenging under the very best of conditions, but once you add the responsibility of keeping a tiny human alive, things can get hairy. Biglaw moms have an unenviable job that taxes their time, resources, and patience.

We’re dedicating a series of posts to the Biglaw moms out there. We want to get into the nitty gritty — the good, the bad, and the ugly. If you want to sound off on your life as a Biglaw mom [email](mailto:kathryn@abovethelaw.com?subject=Your%20Column) us — as always, all communications will be kept anonymous.

First up is an interview with a Biglaw senior associate, let’s call her Britney. Britney had a baby while working at an Am Law 200 firm, and the impact on her career — and pocketbook — has been less than positive. She felt disrespected by her colleagues while she was pregnant, and it was hard to get partners to give her new work. But the real kick in the teeth was after she returned from maternity leave. That’s when she discovered her firm’s policy resulted in her getting stiffed come bonus season — regardless of all the hours she logged while pregnant.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Read on for all the details:

ATL: What do you wish you’d known before you went on maternity leave?

Britney: That maternity leave is not paternity leave and that if you are the mother of a child, you can lose your entire bonus for the year.

ATL: Did having a kid hurt your career?

B: In the short term, I think pregnancy hurt my career (feeling sick, being tired, etc for pregnancy reasons is not given the excuse that the flu is given), but long term, having a kid helped me prioritize.

Whether it hurts my career is TBD.

ATL: Has working in Biglaw changed your family planning?

B: Yes. I will be waiting a good long stretch to see if I make partner before I have kid 2. I will be older than I would have liked to have been, but c’est la vie.

ATL: Any tips for work/life balance?

B: Find a hobby outside of work and kids that makes you happy and stick to pursuing it, or you will possibly go insane. Take care of yourself.

ATL: What’s the worst part about being a Biglaw mom?

B: Worst part is definitely being pregnant and being not taken seriously while pregnant. I felt totally disrespected while I was pregnant — open season for body comments, work evaporated, etc.

ATL: Best part?

B: Best part is that I am closer to having it all than I would be if I weren’t a working mom (if you can ever have it all being a huge debate — maybe my standards are low).

# David Boies Under Fire For 'Slut-Shaming'
## Did Boies cross a line with his litigation tactics?

David Boies

Lawyers enjoy having a variety of tools at their disposal when pursuing their client’s legal interests — no matter what surprises opposing counsel may have, they want to have the perfect response, just raring to go. But what happens when a prominent lawyer takes the well-worn concept of a “zealous” defense too far and takes actions that, while not illegal, are a bit… unsavory?

Sheelah Kolhatkar of The New Yorker takes [an in-depth look](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-super-lawyer-david-boies-turned-a-young-novelists-sexual-past-against-her/amp) at the concept of runaway representation in the litigation strategy deployed by David Boies and Boies Schiller and Flexner in a case about literary plagiarism. It began when novelist Emma Cline released her first book, “[The Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girls_(Cline_novel)).” Shortly after publication, Cline and her publisher, Random House, received a letter from BSF lawyers, including Boies himself, alleging Cline stole parts of The Girls from an ex-boyfriend.

BSF represents Chaz Reetz-Laiolo, who is Cline’s ex, and two former female friends. And in the initial letter to Cline, BSF alleges Cline had spyware installed on her own computer but their clients used Cline’s computer which improperly gave her access to her then-boyfriend’s and friends’ email and personal information.

In their response, Cline’s attorneys indicated Reetz-Laiolo, who is 13 years older, was emotionally and physically abusive and the spyware was installed to see if he was cheating on her. From there, the discussion continued, and at one point in the process BSF sent Cline and her attorneys a draft complaint, should the negotiations breakdown. According to Kolhatkar, it is the contents of that draft complaint that are problematic:

Reading through the allegations, Cline was stunned to find a section titled “Cline’s History of Manipulating Older Men,” which purported to illustrate how Boies Schiller would easily discredit her arguments about her former boyfriend’s treatment of her before a jury. “[E]vidence shows that Cline was not the innocent and inexperienced naïf she portrayed herself to be, and had instead for many years maintained numerous ‘relations’ with older men and others, from whom she extracted gifts and money,” the section began. What followed were thirteen pages containing screenshots of explicit chat conversations with lovers, including one in which Cline had sent a naked photo of herself (the photo was blacked out in the letter) to a boyfriend, explicit banter with people she’d met online, and snippets of her most intimate diary entries. All of this material had been recorded by the spyware and remained on Cline’s old laptop, which Reetz-Laiolo now had in his possession.

Remember the root of the legal conflict is a claim of plagiarism, with the nature of the relationship between Cline and Reetz-Laiolo playing a role. But whether Cline had “engaged in random sexual encounters with strangers she met on Craigslist” or “frequently participated in sexual chat groups in which she, inter alia, posted pornographic ‘selfies’” or “authored pornographic ‘stories,’” is pretty much irrelevant to the instant case.

Zealous representation to one side, Cline’s attorneys see an ulterior motive in including such scandalous revelations in a draft complaint:

“I’m not going to speculate about their motives, but it was content that was completely inappropriate and ludicrous, just based on how sexually graphic it was, to put in a complaint,” Carrie Goldberg, who specializes in representing victims of revenge porn and other forms of harassment, and is one of several attorneys representing Cline in the case, told me. “Legal complaints are public record, and, basically, they’re saying, ‘Hey, if you don’t give us what our client wants, we’re going to put this very personal information out into the open, and the whole world is going to know the inner workings of your sex life and your sexual history and every proclivity that you have.’ ”

BSF partner [Ted Normand ](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/edward-j-normand.html)responds that including the risqué material was a necessary part of their defense after Cline’s legal team raised questions of Reetz-Liaolo’s character:

“[H]er lawyer tried to excuse the inexcusable by raising aspects of the parties’ sexual history,” Edward Normand, the lead lawyer on Reetz-Liaolo’s team, said in a statement. “Only then did we respond, as lawyers must, describing why her claimed defense was inconsistent with the relevant facts.”

But Cline’s attorney, [Carrie Goldberg](http://www.cagoldberglaw.com/team/carrie-goldberg/), still saw something more insidious in the inclusions of such salacious material in the draft complaint. She even called out David Boies himself on the issue, who was personally involved in the case:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
During the sole in-person negotiation discussion between Cline’s attorneys and Boies Schiller, Goldberg explained the concept of “slut-shaming” to David Boies, who, according to Goldberg, claimed to be unfamiliar with it.

Cline herself spoke to The New Yorker about the violation she felt after such personal details were mined for strategic advantage in litigation:

“I never, in any scenario, could have imagined publishing a novel would have resulted in a bunch of lawyers combing through records of my porn habits, or choosing which naked photo of me to include in a legal document. Whatever independence I gained, as a writer and as a person, felt meaningless in the face of this kind of onslaught.”

As one might imagine, with such raised stakes on both sides, a compromise was impossible to reach, and last week both sides filed a complaint against the other party alleging wrongdoing. But since that inflammatory draft complaint was sent, a few things have changed.

Multiple allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Hollywood mogul — and former BSF client — Harvey Weinstein have been made. What’s followed can only be described as an onslaught of allegations against powerful men who have used their positions and money to prey on women, and a corresponding plea to believe the women who make these accusations. What has also [come to light](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/david-boies-takes-responsibility-for-enabling-harvey-weinstein/) is David Boies’s role in perpetuating the cone of silence around Weinstein. On behalf of Weinstein, he hired a private investigation firm that dug into the private lives of women who might speak out against the producer and[ worked to kill any media reports](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/new-york-times-fires-david-boies-over-the-whole-grave-betrayal-thing/) about the sexual assault allegations. He has been — rightly — [criticized](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/david-boies-loses-more-work-over-weinstein-debacle/) for these actions and [issued a mea culpa](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/new-york-times-fires-david-boies-over-the-whole-grave-betrayal-thing/) that included this statement: “I would never knowingly participate in an effort to intimidate or silence women or anyone else…. That is not who I am.”

When BSF filed their complaint against Cline last week, David Boies was no longer listed as an attorney for Reetz-Liaolo. And, notably, the section of the complaint about Cline’s sexual history was no longer there. BSF says it was removed as a “gesture of good faith,” but I suppose it was no longer strictly necessary for the “zealous” defense of their client’s interests.

# Former Solicitor General Don Verrilli To Head Up D.C. Office For Surprising Biglaw Firm
## An unexpected new venture for Don Verrilli.

We all knew about Solicitor General Don Verrilli’s [departure from the Justice Department](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/solicitor-general-don-verrilli-to-step-down-perhaps-before-all-scotus-opinions-are-announced/), but now we know where he’s going to be working. While many of us assumed Verrilli would head back home to Jenner & Block, the firm where he cut his teeth as a high-powered Supreme Court advocate, Verrilli has instead opted for a new challenge: launching a brand-new D.C. office for Munger Tolles, the elite California-based firm.

Intriguingly, as Sara Randazzo at the Wall Street Journal reported, it seems as though [Verrilli had been mulling over](http://www.wsj.com/articles/california-law-firm-hires-former-solicitor-general-for-washington-d-c-office-1475089202) this move even before the leadership at Munger Tolles proposed it:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Mr. Verrilli said that in considering his post-government plans, opening a D.C. office for Munger Tolles, a firm he had always respected, occurred to him even before the firm called to woo him.

“It’s a chance to build something that’ll hopefully outlast me,” he said.

Joining him in the new office will be Michael DeSanctis, a former colleague of Mr. Verrilli’s from the law firm Jenner & Block LLP and former deputy associate attorney general Chad Golder.

Congrats to all three on their new venture! Can’t say anyone expected Munger Tolles to be Verrilli’s new home. The firm has famously restricted itself to Los Angeles and San Francisco until now, but if you want to expand, making the move around the outgoing SG seems like a pretty good excuse.

With PPP averaging around $1.865 million, one suspects Munger Tolles can offer the former Solicitor General enough money to finally pay off those [pesky credit card balances](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/solicitor-general-don-verrillis-surprising-credit-card-debt/)….

In this episode, I speak with Tamra Moore, partner at King & Spalding, about the twists and turns of her career that led her to her role at K&S. Tamra shares what lateraling during a pandemic was like, and how she decided on a firm that worked for her. She also discusses the differences between Biglaw, in-house, and government service. Tamra additionally talks about what a day in the life of a Government Matters attorney is like.


The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Goodwin Procter's 'Flexible' Reopening Plan: A Three-Day Workweek With 'Hoteling' Of Office Space
## Say goodbye to your office space if you don't plan to come in three or more days each week.

As we get closer and closer to the summer months, more and more Biglaw firms are announcing their plans for a return to in-office work in the wake of the pandemic. Based on what we’ve seen so far, the majority of firms seem to have settled on a phased approach, setting their eyes on a September date for a full reopening and saying farewell to the five-day, in-office workweek. The latest firm to make such an announcement is no different, but their plans for the “hoteling” of office space is worth noting.

Goodwin Procter — a firm that came in at No. 23 on the latest Am Law 100 ranking, having brought in $1,486,263,000 gross revenue in 2020 — emailed all attorneys earlier this week letting them know that in-office operations would resume on September 13, 2021. Managing partner Mark T. Bettencourt noted that the firm would be taking a “flexible approach” here, and while employees would be returning to the office, the five-day workweek would not. Here’s a relevant excerpt from that email (emphasis addedl full email available on next page):

We will be taking a flexible approach to working from our offices and do not expect to return to working from our offices five days per week. We will be particularly flexible for the remainder of the calendar year 2021. At that time, we will re-assess and possibly modify our approach. As a reminder, between now and September, all of our offices remain open to those who wish to use them, on an optional basis.

While we do not expect to resume all of our pre-pandemic routines, we do need to maintain our collaborative and dynamic culture, and to enhance learning and professional development opportunities. To do this, we encourage our lawyers be in the office at least three days per week starting the week of September 13.

Goodwin seems to be taking a page from the Ropes & Gray playbook here on the [three-day, in-office workweek](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/ropes-grays-reopening-plan-puts-an-end-to-the-5-day-in-office-workweek-for-associates/). This is where it gets particularly interesting (and strays from the Ropes plan): attorneys who will be in the office fewer than three days a week should no longer expect to have their own offices.

Here’s the exact language on that:

Counsel, associates and professional track attorneys who will work from the office fewer than three days per week should not expect to have a dedicated office space and may need to “hotel” when visiting the office (i.e., use a visiting office or a shared workspace arrangement).

Biglaw firms are trying to [decrease their real estate footprints](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-firm-tells-partners-to-share-their-offices-with-associates/) following the coronavirus crisis, and employees working remotely is making it even easier for firms to accomplish this goal. Goodwin is the first firm that we know of to have announced a formal “hoteling” plan for attorneys.

Finally, while the firm will not be requiring anyone to be vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to their return to the office, vaccination is “strongly encouraged,” and vaccination status will not impact the firm’s expectations for how often someone should be working from the office.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Happy Anniversary! Reflecting On A Year Of Writing For Above The Law

Happy anniversary!  I began writing for Above the Law about one year ago, and this is the 52nd consecutive weekly article I have published on the website.  Writing for Above the Law has been an extremely enriching experience for me, and it has been great sharing my thoughts on this website over the past year.  For my column this week, I wanted take a break from discussing student loans and the legal profession, and rather reflect on my experiences writing for Above the Law.

Many people have asked me over the past year how I connected with Above the Law and began writing for the website.  I started reading Above the Law regularly about a decade or so ago, when the website rose to prominence covering the Great Recession and its impact on the legal community.  I first attended events sponsored by Above the Law in 2012, when I moved back to the New York City area to begin working at my first job after graduating from law school.

As many might remember, 2012 was a good year for Above the Law events, and I had a great time meeting the editors at various parties sponsored by the website.  One of the most amazing events hosted by Above the Law around that time was a bar crawl that included a venue near every law school in Manhattan.  Above the Law rented a party bus to drive the crew around to each bar, and I was honored to be invited on the bus.  I only made it to the bars near Fordham Law, Cardozo, and NYU Law before I had to go home or risk being the subject of an Above the Law piece!

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
After I started my website [Student Debt Diaries](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/) last year, I thought that writing for Above the Law could publicize my own blog and provide me with an outlet to express opinions about the legal profession.  Although I hadn’t been to Above the Law events for a few years, the editors remembered me when I reached out to them.  Maybe this was because I am 6’9’’ and hard to forget, or maybe it was because of the shots I bought everyone on the bar crawl!  In any case, Above the Law published my first piece about a year ago, and this is the 52nd article I have published on the website.

My experience writing for Above the Law has been extremely positive.  For instance, publishing  articles on the website has shown me how multifarious the legal community really is.  I originally thought I would simply receive emails from lawyers who read Above the Law, but I regularly communicate with parents, prospective law students, paralegals, attorneys in all stages of their careers, judges, and a number of other individuals.  I also connect regularly with many doctors, dentists, and other professionals.  My conversations with these individuals has shown me that many of the financial issues involving the legal industry that I write about [are also applicable to people who work in other professions](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/introduction-student-debt-story/).

One of the things that surprised me originally about writing for Above the Law is the trolling that I and other writers on the website receive.  I did not write for Above the Law when the website allowed comments, but I vividly remember how crazy comments on the site used to be.  Since Above the Law justifiably disabled comments, the only ways I get trolled are on social media and [if someone emails me through the contact form on Student Debt Diaries](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/contact-us/).

Thankfully, I have pretty thick skin, and I actually look forward to trolling!  I usually get a good kick out of the negative comments others write, and I share the comments with my brothers and coworkers, who also get a good laugh out of them.  In addition, if one of my articles attracts trolls, I know the piece is being read widely, since the more people who read an article, the more likely someone will actually post negative comments about it.  I am also convinced that trolling helps creates buzz around an article, since people are talking about it, so I actually have trolling to thank for popularizing some of my pieces!

From Pilot and Above The Law  
The most interesting trolling I get is on social media, since most people use their real profiles, and I can see who wrote the comments.  This lack of anonymity usually constricts how crazy comments can be, but sometimes, individuals say some insane stuff even though anyone can directly attribute comments to them.

There are many ways to deal with trolls, and my initial reaction is to troll back.  However this is not constructive, so I usually just show good humor and try to reach a positive outcome with the trolls.  I have had some great back and forth with many of my trolls, and I look forward to this part of publishing content online.

Another realization I have after publishing content on Above the Law for around a year is that it is insanely hard to predict when an article will go viral.  Unlike my boss Elie Mystal, who goes viral just about every week, [I only published one piece that really took off](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/being-free-from-student-loans-is-not-as-awesome-as-youd-think/), and a handful of other articles that were read tens of thousands of times.

I never expected that any of the articles that were widely read would be so popular, and I have written articles that I thought would be popular that ended up not being read much at all.  I have given up trying to write pieces that will go viral, since it is very hard to predict how popular an article will be.

All told, it has been a real pleasure writing for Above the Law, and I hope to be a columnist for years to come.  I originally thought it would be difficult to think of article ideas each week for this column [and my own website](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/blog/), but it is usually easy to write my pieces.  The legal industry is such a multi-faceted community, and I enjoy discussing my experiences practicing law and paying off student debt.

# Some Random Friday Fun: A Biglaw Associate's Music Video

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/St-Lenox-Thurgood-Marshall-Ten-Hymns-From-My-American-Gothic.png)When Biglaw attorneys try their hand at making music videos, big fun is sure to ensue.

Back in 2014, a Weil Gotshal associate produced an epic [“save the date” video](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/the-biglaw-wedding-to-end-all-biglaw-weddings/) for his wedding (video no longer online, sadly, but the associate is [still at Weil](http://www.weil.com/people/bambo-obaro)). Earlier this year, a Skadden partner said goodbye to his legal career — and hello to his second act as a winemaker — in a humorous [musical departure memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-partner-goes-out-in-blaze-of-glory-with-musical-departure-video/).

Today we bring you a different kind of Biglaw music video — still extremely well-executed, but with somewhat higher artistic aspirations. We learned about it from an associate at Holland & Knight:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[A]n associate at my firm is a very talented musician, and very few people at the firm actually know or understand this. He opened for the Mountain Goats in Ohio recently and has a new album, Ten Hymns From My American Gothic. But of immediate interest to ATL, perhaps, is he’s made a music video about law school that is getting a little attention:

[http://www.stereogum.com/1897860/st-lenox-thurgood-marshall-video/mp3s/](http://www.stereogum.com/1897860/st-lenox-thurgood-marshall-video/mp3s/)

At the very least, I’m proud of him and wish more people knew about him. But I also think it’s a cool story about lawyers who do other things. Just thought I’d share!

Here’s what [Stereogum](http://www.stereogum.com/1897860/st-lenox-thurgood-marshall-video/mp3s/) has to say about the lawyer/musician in question, [Andrew “Andy” Choi](https://www.hklaw.com/Andrew-Choi/), who performs as “St. Lenox”:

St. Lenox is Andy Choi, a New York lawyer and Juilliard-trained concert violinist whose extremely distinct music is equal parts jarring and charming. Choi’s voice is one of the most striking instruments in music today, a harsh and commanding howl that reminds me of John Darnielle, Michael Stipe, and Xiu Xiu’s Jamie Stewart but is something entirely its own. His subject matter is equally transfixing and unique, a mix of queer love songs, protest music, and savvy observations about the modern American experience.

And tributes to late Supreme Court justices mixed in with reflections on contemporary U.S. legal education. We present to you the video for the lead single from Choi’s new album, “Thurgood Marshall.” There’s a lot going on here (including a great shout-out to Professor Richard Epstein, the star of the first narrative); note that Choi has a Ph.D. in philosophy as well as musical training from Juilliard.

# Firm Boosts First-Year Salaries To $180K For The Coming Year

Talk about an October surprise! Just when the associate salary frenzy had fully receded into a fond summer memory, we receive word that another firm has jumped on the $180K bandwagon, giving us an excuse to break out [more pictures of sexy money](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-23-sexiest-stock-images-of-money/).

Welcome, Fitzpatrick Cella! The IP firm with offices in New York, D.C., and Orange County sent an email to all associates on Monday informing them of the first-year salary bump effective January 1. According to the firm, older associates will be getting raises as well, but those are yet to be determined. They’ll hear sometime before the end of the year.

Until that announcement, senior associates will have to fret some “salarunching” — a word I just made up for smaller salary raises between advancing years because we’ve written “salary crunching” too many times — a common result when firms try to snag all the glory of raising first-years to scale and keeping mum on older lawyers. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. As we’ve said, not every firm needs to keep pace with Cravath at all levels. Still, it’s worth keeping on eye on the extent of the shortfall.

# Biglaw Firms Need To Show Some 'Humanity' In Their Office Reopening Plans

I don’t think we can underestimate the next transition point and the effect that’s going to have on people. There are people who rode five days a week on public transportation, who haven’t been on public transportation since the beginning of the pandemic—since 2020. And even just the thought of getting on the train, that’s a big deal for people. So, there has to be ongoing conversations, ongoing empathy, not just an automatic date when everything just goes back. There has to be a humanity in it all.

— [Allison Blixt](https://www.wsgr.com/en/people/allison-blixt.html), senior director of professional development, diversity, and inclusion at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, commenting on the need to have [empathy for law firm employees as they transition back to the office](https://www.law.com/2021/10/06/law-firms-still-beset-by-chronic-underestimation-of-wellness/) after more than 18 months away due to the pandemic. After all, for many, the return to the office could be “equally as traumatizing” as when COVID-19 forced departure. Wilson Sonsini is planning its return to in-person work in [February 2022](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/wilson-sonsini-february-2022/).

# Johnny Depp Dating Lawyer Who Represented Him In Defamation Trial
## The pair found love on the high seas of litigation.

We know what you’re thinking, and we’ll come right out and say it: No, not that lawyer and no, not that defamation trial.

The lawyer you’re probably thinking of is [Camille Vasquez](https://brownrudnick.com/people/camille-m-vasquez/) of Brown Rudnick, who represented Depp in court in Virginia. During his weeks-long defamation trial against his ex-wife, Amber Heard, the press went wild with speculation that the famed actor was dating Vasquez. The Biglaw associate did not, in fact, win Depp’s heart — nor was she trying to do so, and she went so far as to call the rumors of a lawyerly romance “sexist” — but she did help win his case, and was rewarded with partnership for it.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The lawyer who Depp is actually dating is [Joelle Rich](https://www.schillingspartners.com/team-member/joelle-rich/), the Schillings partner who represented the star during his defamation case in the UK against The Sun. Depp may have lost in that trial but it looks like he found love along the way. According to [Us Magazine](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/johnny-depp-is-dating-married-lawyer-joelle-rich-from-u-k-libel-case/), insiders say of Depp and Rich that “[t]heir chemistry is off the charts.” Here are some additional details:

[Rich] was not part of the legal team who represented him in his defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard earlier this year. She was, however, present in the Virginia courtroom to show her “support” for the Oscar nominee.

“There was no professional obligation for her being there. It was personal,” the source tells Us, adding that the duo “discreetly” met up in hotels during the early stages of their romance.

The insider notes that Rich was married when she met Depp, but is now divorcing her husband. She and her estranged spouse share two children.

“It’s serious between them. They are the real deal,” the source continued.

Yo ho, yo ho, will it be a pirate life for this attorney? Depp has learned that it’s always a good idea to have a lawyer close on hand, so we imagine that this is one attorney/client relationship that will go the distance.

As [reported by ](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-proskauer-rose-top-brass-fly-grill-bullying-london-partner)RollonFriday, firm leaders at Proskauer have taken an active interest in allegations of bullying that keep cropping up around a particular partner in the London office. Allegations [first surfaced in 2020](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-proskauer-rose-associate-quits-alleging-harassment-partner), when an associate left the firm, citing the inappropriate behavior of a particular partner (unnamed, but referred to as “Dom” in reports).

At that time, employees in the London office were informed of the allegations, and the firm said, “Proskauer does not tolerate disrespectful or inappropriate behaviour,” and “we encourage anyone to report behaviour that they believe violates Proskauer’s policies.”

Now RollonFriday reports multiple people have come forward to the firm with their own stories about the partner:

Its encouragement paid off. Post-lockdown, Dom got back in the office and “back in action”, said a source, resulting in fellow partners and associates whistleblowing on his conduct to HR and the US head office.

An insider estimated that approximately seven members of Dom’s team came forward with concerns regarding bullying.

“Associates are at their wits end, breaking down and refusing to do work with [Dom]”, said a source.

The report also alleges that the complaints were a big enough deal that firm leaders — including chair Steven Ellis —  addressed the matter in-person with the partner.

The firm said, “We encourage everyone to report behaviour that they believe violates our policies. The Firm conducts a full investigation of any reports of inappropriate behaviour and takes corrective action when warranted.”

We try to find that sweet spot of doing the most significant deals and doing them in volume. The sky is not falling here.

— Kirkland partner [Daniel Wolf](https://www.kirkland.com/lawyers/w/wolf-daniel-e-pc), in comments given to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/us-deals-help-keep-law-firms-busy-amid-global-ma-lull-2023-10-04/) on the firm’s first-place finish in the London Stock Exchange’s rankings of M&A legal advisers. While global M&A has fallen to a 10-year low, Wolf remained optimistic, calling this year’s numbers “pretty impressive,” historically speaking.

# Kirkland & Ellis Ripped In Blistering Benchslap
## Why do lawyers have to make things difficult?

The most straightforward dispute in the legal recruiting world involves a recruiter jumping from one agency to another and along the way allegedly appropriates trade secrets and violates non-solicitation agreements. The former employer then — if not resolved amicably — has to file a lawsuit and lay out all the recruiting activity the ex-employee has been doing in breach of these obligations to the former firm. Pretty simple, right?

That’s what Kinney Recruiting thought too.[[1]](#f1) They sued a former employee, who refused to comply with discovery, arguing that he didn’t control the documents of the supposed new firm even though the domain name of the new company was his name and he signs all of their contracts. Given this intransigence, Kinney also subpoenaed Kirkland & Ellis, where the former employee allegedly placed people in breach of the obligations to Kinney. Also pretty simple.

K&E decided to make it difficult.

First, they objected to service. Then, after it was re-served, partner [Will Pruitt](https://www.kirkland.com/lawyers/p/pruitt-william-t) objected to the subpoena, saying Kinney needed to get everything from the former employee. Kinney offered to narrow the subpoena but explained that they needed these relatively easy to procure documents because the defendant was not complying with discovery. After refusing to cooperate with a narrower request — twice — Kirkland also threatened to seek fees if Kinney filed a motion to compel. After one more, unanswered, plea for cooperation,

Kinney filed a motion to compel.


Robert Kinney, Kinney Recruiting

K&E replied by claiming to already be working on the request and asking that the motion be dropped. Kinney, having not been born yesterday, refused to drop the motion until K&E produced the documents. He even offered to drop the motion if K&E would just stipulate that they were trying to comply, but Pruitt refused to even do that and instead responded to the motion to compel.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
United States Magistrate Judge Andrew W. Austin — who sits in Austin, which one can only assume is some kind of power-up — was not pleased with Kirkland’s conduct. The line “petty, technical, [and] overly-argumentative” comes up:

The Court could not be more disappointed with the manner in which K&E has handled this subpoena. Pruitt’s petty, technical, overly-argumentative emails are a study in what is wrong with civil discovery in our court system today. The subpoena at issue sought a very small amount of uncontroversial information. None of it was privileged or confidential. MWK had served similar subpoenas on other “BigLaw” firms, all of which produced documents without objection. K&E’s approach, however, was to evade, complain, and refuse. The fact that these actions were taken by a law firm makes it all the more frustrating. If anyone should know better than to act this way one would think it would be a law firm that touts itself as having “lawyers [who] employ innovative pragmatic strategies.” There was not a single thing that K&E did to respond to this subpoena that was “pragmatic.” Despite the countless hours Pruitt spent writing emails, K&E eventually produced the requested documents—but it forced MWK to file a motion to compel before it did so. Pruitt could have saved K&E, as well as MWK, thousands of dollars in attorney time by being cooperative up front. Instead, he chose to fight, forcing all parties, the Court included, to expend resources unnecessarily.

Yikes. This would be a scathing enough rebuke, but Kirkland & Ellis had already decided to ask for more having followed through on Pruitt’s original threat to seek fees for responding to the motion to compel, which Magistrate Austin found particularly galling:

But this is not the end of things. Having chosen the stubborn route, K&E also audaciously requests that the Court award it the attorney’s fees it incurred in picking this fight. Recall that in the first week of February, Kinney offered to accept as sufficient exactly what K&E finally produced two months later. K&E refused, and instead forced Kinney to wait two months, write a dozen more emails, and then file a motion to compel. Kinney even repeated that same offer multiple times before he filed the motion. Yet K&E somehow thinks that it should be awarded attorney’s fees. Apparently it believes obstinance is something worth rewarding. Far from it. If anything, K&E should count itself lucky that MWK did not request fees from K&E, as the Court would have been inclined to grant them. Because MWK did not, the Court will express its disapproval of K&E’s actions only in words and not dollars. Either way, K&E should be embarrassed.

The lesson here is when a party is bending over backward to make compliance as painless as possible, just go ahead and comply. Entities like K&E always worry about the precedent they might set complying third-party subpoenas willy-nilly, but rather than fight it, that’s all the more reason to reach out to a cooperative party and come up with some sort of stipulation to hand over non-privileged and non-confidential documents voluntarily.

It’s pretty simple.

[ [1]](#reff1) The party to the case is MWK Recruiting, but the dispute is about an employee of the more familiar Kinney Recruiting. By means of full disclosure, Kinney is a longtime advertiser on this site, but that doesn’t really factor into our analysis here.

# The Flattening Of Associate Salaries: Another Firm Matches New York Pay For Outside Market
## Another firm signals that it's serious about attracting New York talent.

Back in the day, New York associates made more money than associates around the country because they worked, on balance, more hours and the complexity of the work demanded top talent that firms were willing to pay a premium to secure. Now it seems like everyone’s paying the New York scale in a bid to break up the Big Apple’s monopoly on that key talent. It started with the 2016 nationwide salary bump and has since trickled into more and more smaller markets ever since. Alston & Bird [raised salaries in Charlotte last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/forget-bonuses-these-associates-just-got-raises/), and now Lowenstein has bumped salaries to New York levels for its Northern New Jersey associates starting in the new year.

While there are definitely some markets that have absolutely no business matching the New York scale — you all know which markets you are — Lowenstein’s Roseland, New Jersey office fits the mold of a salary bump that makes a lot of sense. It competes in the same geographic market with New York firms and the cost of living is comparable. A firm hoping to bring high-quality legal service to that office has to be prepared to pony up because otherwise the candidates they’re eyeing will just find themselves a New York firm.

But don’t hold your breath for a boom in New Jersey salaries. Lowenstein isn’t just a national firm that happens to have a New Jersey office. With its home office is almost as big as the New York team and supporting a bustling Life Sciences practice in a hotbed of pharmaceutical and other medical tech headquarters, the New Jersey office is every bit a contributor to the firm’s bottom line as the New York or Palo Alto offices and it needs the talent to get that work done.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
That’s not something the bulk of New Jersey regional firms can boast and they’re just not going to be able to match what the folks at Lowenstein can do for its associates. So when other Jersey attorneys reach the bottom of their W2s, these words billow up inside them as prayer, as regret, as praise, “Lowenstein, Lowenstein.”[[1]](#f1)

# It'll Be Easier To Go To The Moon Again Than To Close The Gender Parity Gap In Law

Please explain to me why this country could land men on the moon and have them walk on the lunar surface 50 years ago, and women today [still can’t break the glass ceiling](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/the-glass-ceiling-report-slow-progress-for-women-in-the-legal-profession/) in a  profession that still hinders us from gender parity.

Since most of the ATL readers were born at least a dozen or so years after the moonwalk (and I am not talking about Michael Jackson’s), it’s hard for millennials and those younger to understand how momentous that occasion was for us dinosaurs. We were in the middle of the Cold War and Russia had been beating the pants off of us in space, at least until President Kennedy said, essentially, “Enough, we’re going to beat the pants off Russia before the end of the decade.” And we did.

To see the nation and indeed the world hold their collective breaths was remarkable and those who witnessed the moon landing and moonwalk will never forget them. We had lived through a decade of turmoil: Vietnam, both the war and the anti-war protests; assassinations of President Kennedy, the Reverend Martin Luther King, and Senator Robert Kennedy; cities burning. I could go on. We all wanted something to hold on to, to show each other and the world that we could collaborate, come together as a team to do something that was unimaginable even a few years before. We had the will, the perseverance, the determination for Apollo 11 to succeed and it did. So did we.

Where is our will, our perseverance, our determination for gender parity in the profession? Don’t look at me. I’ve been jumping up and down about this for years, as have many of my dinosaurial colleagues (both women and men). Jumping up and down after a while gets tiring, and I’m tired, in fact, I’m pooped. So are many others.

Where is the leadership? I don’t care who it is and where it comes from.  It could be a one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people eater.


I am tired of hearing how much progress we’re allegedly making in law firms. Please, spare me. Yes, we’re doing better in corporate, academia, and the judiciary, but I don’t think such achievements point the way to parity.

There have been a number of articles in newspapers and elsewhere — “think pieces” is what journalists call them — about why it’s so unlikely that we will, in my lifetime, and maybe even yours, ever see anything like Apollo 11 again. A recent article in the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-could-apollo-11-be-repeated-20190714-story.html) talked about why what happened 50 years ago could not be replicated now, and I think comments apply to our profession’s seeming reluctance to move forward.

What made Apollo 11 possible? It was a number of factors, including a tolerance for risk, a leadership culture, and a collaborative political environment, things that do not exist today. It was management, national commitment, and the personal motivation of the participants.

Speaking at Rice University in Houston in 1962, President Kennedy said that “we choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hard.” Yes, gender parity is not easy to achieve, yes, it is hard, but we need leadership, commitment, and personal motivation, to move the needle more than just a little bit. Do we have leadership, commitment, and personal motivation to make that happen? You tell me.

Yes, things have improved for women lawyers in the past 50 years. True, but only up to a point. More than 50 percent of current law students are women. It also doesn’t explain why, as women move up the ranks, their numbers dwindle, nor does it explain why women compose less than [25 percent of equity partners](https://www.law360.com/articles/1164440/the-2019-law360-glass-ceiling-report). Women fare better in leadership positions in both corporate and academic environments, not to mention the judiciary.

So, we put men on the moon, but we seem to be unable and/or unwilling to do what needs to be done for gender parity here on earth. For those of us who were sentient 50 years ago, who watched the lunar landing from wherever we were at that time, it seemed like the nation and the world were, for a few precious moments, one. That’s certainly not true today.

Gerry Griffin, an Apollo-era flight director, who later became head of the Johnson Space Center in Texas, said that the risk-taking culture of the time propelled the man on the moon project forward. That culture didn’t know what a comfort zone was. As he said in the Los Angeles Times article, “The leadership pushed decisions down in the organization, they didn’t elevate them. They trusted people below them. The idea was, let’s not worry about who gets credit; let’s not second-guess everybody.” That doesn’t sound familiar today.

Regardless of what some people say, gender parity is not a “pipeline” problem; there are plenty of women who can succeed in law firms, but who aren’t given opportunities to do so, and who then drop out the higher they rise. It’s not just leaving to take care of the family and/or the kids or to pursue other opportunities. It’s fights about origination credits; it’s reluctance to share the work. The biases are real. When women lead, men are more likely to react badly, using the old tropes of “bossy,” “aggressive,” or other similar unflattering and demeaning adjectives.

The moon is approximately 240,000 miles away. That distance may well be easier to span than closing the gender parity gap. As President Kennedy said, we need to do this “not because it is easy, but because it is hard.” We do lots of hard things, but gender parity needn’t be one of them.

# Law Firm Partner Charged After Pretending To Be A Lawyer For A Decade
## Why bother wasting away in law school when you can just tell people you're a lawyer?

Many students trudge through law school for three years with big dreams, hoping to someday slip the brass ring of law firm partnership onto their finger. With up to six figures of student loan debt later, recent graduates will put their nose to the grindstone and study endlessly prior to taking the bar exam. Those who pass the test will toil away as young attorneys at their firms for years and years, wishing, wanting, and waiting for the moment when they’ll be able to make the victorious leap from associate to partner. When that day finally comes, it will be a glorious occasion, if only because they’ve worked so hard to achieve it.

But why bother wasting away in law school and law practice for all those years — and not to mention accumulating all of that debt — when you can just tell people you’re a lawyer?

That seems to be exactly what Kimberly Kitchen, a Pennsylvania woman who was recently elevated to the partnership of [BMZ Law Offices](http://www.bmzlaw.com/home.html), is accused of having done. We [wrote about Kitchen last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/oops-law-firm-promotes-associate-who-likely-wasnt-a-lawyer-to-partner/) when news of her alleged transgressions first broke, and now she’s been formally charged with forgery, unauthorized practice of law, and felony records tampering.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As we noted previously, Kitchen claimed to have graduated from Duquesne University School of Law in 2005, and then worked for BMZ Law for about 10 years before being promoted to partner in April 2014. She also claimed to have taught as a professor at Columbia Law School. Prior to these charges being brought, she claimed to have worked as a paralegal at Reed Smith for more than a decade on her [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kim-kitchen/7/920/527) (which has since been taken down). This is what her bio on the BMZ Law website used to look like:

Unfortunately for Ms. Kitchen, the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office just wasn’t buying what she was selling. Here are some additional details from [NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pennsylvania-woman-charged-after-making-partner-fake-law-degree-n332231):

Kitchen allegedly forged numerous documents attesting that she was a licensed attorney, including an attorney’s license for 2014, supposed bar examination results, supposed records of her law school attendance and a check purporting to show she’d paid her registration fees.

Duquesne University told NBC station WJAC of Johnstown in December, when the state investigation began, that it had no record of Kitchen’s having attended. The state attorney’s registration office shows no listing for her.

Despite the fact that Kitchen had no attorney records on file with the state to speak of, that didn’t stop her from becoming president of the Huntingdon County Bar Association. Perhaps the only prerequisite for local bar membership in Pennsylvania is a pulse.

When partners at BMZ Law first caught wind of Kim Kitchen’s alleged lack of a law degree or bar admission, the firm [released a statement](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/oops-law-firm-promotes-associate-who-likely-wasnt-a-lawyer-to-partner/): “Sadly, it would appear that our firm was the last, in a long line of professionals, to have been deceived by Ms. Kitchen into believing she was licensed to practice law.” The firm is currently going through all of the files she worked on to make sure nothing that was left in her unlearned hands was screwed up.

Kimberly Kitchen is looking at a few years in jail over this decade-long debacle. It’s a shame she didn’t specialize in criminal law, because she could have represented herself.

If ending your lunch hour with bonus news isn’t a big motivator to do your best work again that afternoon, then we don’t know what is. That’s exactly what just happened at Ropes & Gray, one of the top Biglaw firms in the country.

Unsurprisingly, the firm is matching the Cravath year-end bonus scale as well as the Davis Polk special bonus scale — with more money for its most senior associates. Here’s what that looks like:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Note that the firm is doling out $130K bonuses to the class of 2013 and beyond. Will any other firm be willing to make this match for its senior associates?

On top of these bonuses, Ropes will be handing out even more money to those associates who have really put in a lot of work this year. “We also recognize that this year has brought a heavy volume of work for many of you, and we know the sacrifices you have made to continue providing our clients the highest level of service,” write chair Julie Jones and managing partner David Djaha. “Therefore, we are increasing the bonuses listed below for those of you who annualized above our target and helped us bring the year to a successful close.”

Congratulations to everyone at the firm on a fantastic year!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Ropes & Gray.)

# Promoting Diversity In Law: A Strategic Guide For Navigating The Post-Affirmative Action Legal Landscape
## The Supreme Court's decision on race-conscious affirmative action has created challenges for promoting racial diversity in the legal profession. Legal recruiters play a vital role in mitigating the impact and driving progress while ensuring a diverse and inclusive legal community.

Impact of the Supreme Court’s Decision on Diversity in the Legal Profession

The Supreme Court’s decision ending race-conscious affirmative action in college and law school admissions has sparked a reevaluation of efforts to promote racial diversity, not just on campuses but also [in the workplace](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/business/economy/hiring-affirmative-action.html) more broadly. In the legal profession, as in many industries, the Court’s stand puts in jeopardy the progress that has been made over the last several years. This moment challenges those of us who believe in the value of a diverse profession to think creatively about opportunities to redouble our efforts.

The Role of Legal Recruiters in Upholding Diversity in Law Firms

Legal recruiters have a role to play—consistent with the law—in mitigating the impact of what we expect will be a reduced number of diverse graduates from the nation’s most prestigious law schools. We have an obligation to press ahead on our long-held vision of a profession that better reflects the diversity of our country.

Recent Progress in Racial Diversity Within U.S. Law Firms

In recent years, law firms have made undeniable progress on racial diversity, even if the pace of change has been slower than we would wish.  NALP’s [Report on Diversity in U.S. Law Firms](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/Research/2022NALPReportonDiversity_Final.pdf) found that in 2022, the representation of Black associates at major U.S. law firms grew by half a percentage point, to 5.8%, and the proportion of Black summer associates rose by 0.7 percentage point, to 11.9%. Moreover, for the first time, women of color achieved representation of greater than 10% among lawyers overall.

The Influence of the Mansfield Rule on Law Firm Diversity

This progress is partly attributable to active efforts like the [Mansfield Rule](https://www.diversitylab.com/pilot-projects/mansfield-rule-5-0-certified-firms/). Modeled after the National Football League’s Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview diverse candidates as part of the head coach hiring process, the Mansfield Rule presses law firms to consider “a broad slate of talent – including at least 30% underrepresented lawyers – for leadership positions.” Firms committed to that standard can become Mansfield Certified. Of course, it remains to be seen whether Mansfield and similar efforts will persist in their current form following the Supreme Court’s decision.

Challenges to Racial Diversification in Law Firm Partnership Ranks

Disappointingly, among the law firm partnership ranks, racial diversification has appeared to be stagnating even without the added burden of the Supreme Court’s new holding. NALP found no statistically significant growth in equity partners of color in 2022. The top echelon of the profession remains its least diverse segment.

Strategic Steps Legal Recruiters Can Take Amid Reduced Law School Diversity

So how can search firms like Lateral Link continue to drive progress, even if law school classes become less racially diverse in the immediate future?

Deepening Partnerships with Law Schools and Alumni Associations

First, we can deepen our partnership with law schools and their alumni associations, curating creative ways to support diverse students in their efforts to navigate the legal recruiting landscape successfully. Our goal should be to equip the diverse students who are admitted—even if the numbers are smaller—with sufficient knowledge and inspiration to make it to elite law firms.

The Power of Personal Interaction and Mentorship Programs

There are countless opportunities to connect with and educate students, according to [Amy Langan](https://laterallink.com/team/amy-langan/), Lateral Link Professional Development and Law School Relations Manager. “In our experience, student affinity groups are highly receptive to hosting speakers from the recruiting sector.” Examples of potential presentation topics include interviewing tips, how to choose a practice area, market-specific updates, and how to pursue a non-traditional legal career. As legal recruiters, we have a birds-eye view of the legal industry nationwide, and we can share with law students our insights about job opportunities in the cities that they are targeting for summer and permanent associate positions. Amy notes that “we can visit HBCU law schools, and we can sponsor or attend job fairs known to attract diverse students. Showing up and being visibly supportive makes a real difference.”

Tailored Mentorship: Fostering Success for Diverse Students

In addition to giving presentations in larger settings, recruiters can help facilitate more tailored one-on-one mentorship, for example by helping to pair lawyers and legal recruiters with students who are members of diverse affinity groups. The Orange County Korean American Bar Association (OCKABA) offers an example. Lateral Link Senior Director [Christina Ahn](https://laterallink.com/team/christina-ahn/) co-chairs the OCKABA Mentorship & Outreach Committee, which pairs law student mentees with attorney mentors based on the student’s interest and the attorney’s practice area. Attorney mentors regularly offer personalized insight into how to advance successfully in a law firm setting.

Collaborative Partnerships: Supporting Racially Diverse Attorneys

Second, legal recruiters can partner with law firms and State Bar Associations to jointly assist racially diverse attorneys to thrive at all levels of seniority, in a manner that remains compliant with the Court’s ruling. Recruiters bring substantial intelligence to the table, with knowledge both of what law firms are looking for in potential lateral hires and of the individual needs of diverse candidates. An example of a forum where this knowledge can make a major contribution is the Texas Minority Counsel Program—the premier client development, networking, and CLE event for Texas attorneys. Open to everyone, the program’s mission is to increase opportunities for diverse attorneys, and to expose organizations to the legal talent of diverse attorneys in Texas.

Curating Initiatives for Diversity in Law Firm Partnerships

In the particular context of law firm partner opportunities, legal recruiters can work with firms to curate new initiatives that comply with the Supreme Court decision and, at the same time, ensure that partners of color can thrive in the law firm platform. Specifically, legal recruiters can work closely with law firms to help them prioritize diversity in partner recruiting and retention.

The Importance of Intentionality in Diversity Efforts

Now more than ever, legal recruiters have to be intentional about being part of the solution. Just hoping for the best will not create diverse and inclusive legal communities. Being intentional may at times entail discussing sensitive issues that impact diverse partners disproportionately, such as origination credit formulas, lateral partner integration, and diversity, equality, and inclusive initiatives at each of the firms we work with. Sometimes these conversations may generate a measure of discomfort or resistance, but recruiters need to use our access to advance the discussion of these essential matters.

Happiness is a synonym for self-care. While self-care is a buzzword, you are in control of how you define it and how you incorporate it into your life. If you feel that you do not have time for self-care, or that it is selfish or not necessary, notice how you feel reading the statements below when “self-care” is replaced with “happiness”:

My self-care is not a priority. 

My happiness is not a priority.

To prioritize your happiness think about small choices that are within your control every single day. While small actions might feel insignificant in the moment, all of your choices compound over time and get you closer to, or further from, how you want to feel and who you want to become. 

When you think about billable hours, whether or not you have pressure to reach a certain amount, explore how you can bill yourself at least a 0.1 every single day. Your happiness is worth at least 6 minutes a day.

Can you go outside for a few minutes of sunshine instead of a long walk?  

Can you take time to savor your morning coffee or tea instead of multitasking as you get ready?

What if you read a few pages of a great book and address any house or office clutter another time?

Instead of a long workout, how can you move your body for a few minutes?

If a passion project is what your soul desires more time for, what small choice can you make today to create more time for it? Maybe you need to order something, or register for a class at a later date. Make sure you schedule time for your passion project in your calendar, even if in short increments, and keep the commitments you make to yourself. Everyone and everything will always be competing for your time, so be prepared when, not if, obstacles arise.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When you keep commitments to yourself and prioritize your happiness you will inevitably disappoint people, which might include your kids, at various times. Be kind to yourself, and give yourself grace and compassion. You do so much and problem solve for others every day. Isn’t it time that you stop disappointing yourself? Sometimes tomorrow turns into never, and your happiness should not be an afterthought.

You are a role model to your children, and they learn how to prioritize, or not prioritize, themselves and their happiness by what you choose to do or not do. They are watching and listening to you. If your children want to grow up to be just like you, what does their future life look like? Are they putting themselves first, or last?

There are many ways you can make time for yourself while simultaneously using those moments to teach your children how to do the same thing. When you need time to yourself, inside or outside of the house, communicate that with your children. Explain why your personal time and activity of choice is important to you, and how it will make you feel. You can even suggest that they use that same time to do something for themselves, and have them explain to you how it will make them feel.

While self-care should include time away from your children, it can also include time with your children. Consider incorporating “self-care time” or “happiness time” with your kids and explain to them the importance of taking time to incorporate daily joy into their lives. You can even encourage your children to let you know when they need time for self-care, including time to be alone. For example, if they are feeling stressed, overwhelmed or anxious, you can encourage them to do something that they find calming. If they have spent a lot of time studying or practicing a skill or sport, ask them how they can celebrate their effort. It is those moments that can be both educational and memorable for you both.

Allow your happiness, personally and professionally, to drive your daily decisions.

Self-care does not have to be earned, and it should be something you do for yourself daily. Wherever you are in life and however you are feeling, give yourself permission to pause and make yourself and your happiness a priority, not an option.

Which top law firm will make it rain for associates?

The halls are alive… with the sound of money. As we recently mentioned, there’s increasingly common talk about a [new and improved salary scale for Biglaw associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-5-arguments-in-favor-of-a-biglaw-pay-hike/).

Earlier this month, we shared with you [five arguments in favor of a Biglaw pay hike](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-5-arguments-in-favor-of-a-biglaw-pay-hike/) (not that you needed convincing — at least the associates among you). In today’s story, the latest installment in our [“NY to 190”](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ny-to-190/) series, we’ll offer some thoughts — and seek yours as well — on which top law firm will take the market higher.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As regular Above the Law readers know, there already are a fair number of firms that pay above-market base salaries — the members of what we like to call the [$160K Plus Club](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-160k-plus-club/). But these firms tend to be (1) small and (2) very demanding in their hiring standards (yes, even more demanding than most Biglaw firms, which are already highly selective). If the broader Biglaw market is going to go a higher pay level, the charge will have to be led by a large firm, one with hundreds of associates, that most other major firms see (or aspire to see) as a peer.

For my money, the market mover will be a member of the [Fab Five](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/where-are-the-biglaw-bonuses-associate-bonus-watch-day-3/). As I wrote last year, while we waited for bonus news to break:

There are, at most, five firms with any role to play in setting compensation for the top-shelf, New York-focused, lockstep firms — a compensation scale that then becomes the benchmark for Biglaw around the country. I will call these firms the “Fab Five”: Cravath (the usual first mover), Davis (last year’s scale setter), Simpson (last year’s first mover), Skadden (2008’s first mover), and Sullivan & Cromwell (which hasn’t been a player super-recently, but I’m giving them credit for [making spring bonuses happen](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/associate-bonus-watch-sullivan-cromwell-pays-generous-spring-bonuses/) back in 2011).

That discussion related to bonuses. But if you look at the history of base salary increases over the years, you’ll see the Fab Five dominating as well. Here’s the chronology (our “Throwback Thursday” gift to you):

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
January 2007: Simpson Thacher took starting salaries [from $145,000 to $160,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/). That move, which seems like ages ago (because it was), came in response to financial firms — investment banks, hedge funds, private equity — taking talent from law firms (especially midlevel and senior associates). The top New York firms quickly matched Simpson — and the new pay scale gradually spread to less elite firms and to other major markets, as we lovingly chronicled in these pages.

February 2006: Sullivan & Cromwell took starting salaries from $125,000 to $145,000. That was a few months before Above the Law launched, so here is Ashby Jones’s [WSJ Law Blog post](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2006/02/15/the-new-york-salary-dance/) about the news. Simpson and Cravath matched within two weeks (and I suspect that the matching will happen faster next time around, thanks in part to ATL and other sites that cover Biglaw comp).

Interestingly enough, as noted in this [New York Times piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/01/business/01legal.html?_r=0), the S&C move was viewed by some as a response to Quinn Emanuel — which was more of a boutique back then — raising starting salaries in 2005 to $135,000, a cut above the $125,000 going rate for Biglaw at the time. So boutiques and other smaller firms shouldn’t be dismissed as completely irrelevant to Biglaw pay setting; as more of them pay better than Biglaw, siphoning talent away from Cravath and S&C and toward members of the $160K Plus Club, the pressure for a pay hike grows.

Also, note how S&C’s move to $145K was followed by STB’s move to $160K in a little more than a year. Now that we’re coming up on almost a decade of pay scale stagnation, it’s hard to imagine two base-salary bumps in rapid succession. Thanks, Great Recession.

February 2000: Around this time, Davis Polk raised starting salaries from (roughly) $105,000 to $125,000, as noted in this [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/02/business/law-firms-pay-soars-to-stem-dot-com-defections.html) (dated February 2, and referring to a DPW announcement made “in the last week”). This raise was also driven in part by a non-Biglaw firm: the Silicon Valley powerhouse of Gunderson Dettmer, which raised to $125K prior to Davis in order to stem defections during the first dot-com boom.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
It’s interesting to see DPW as a compensation leader. Until Davis [beat the Simpson bonuses two years ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/associate-bonus-watch-davis-polk-beats-simpson/), launching the Great Bonus War of 2014, it was regarded as a follower rather than a leader on pay. But that’s not entirely fair, considering that it did lead the third most-recent round of salary increases.

So to recap, the last three rounds of Biglaw pay raises, dating back more than 15 years, were led by Simpson (2007), Sullivan (2006), and Davis Polk (2000). This leaves Cravath and Skadden as the two Fab Five members who haven’t led a salary hike in this millennium.

Personally I’d bet on Cravath. It is still, in the minds of many, the quintessential Biglaw firm, synonymous with profit, power, and prestige. It’s smaller than Skadden, with less than a third of the headcount, and almost all of its lawyers are based in New York, so CSM would have an easier time than SASMF in terms of rolling out a pay raise. Skadden would have to decide, for example, whether it wants to raise salaries in all of its offices, both around the nation and around the world.

That’s just my guess, and I might be wrong. It’s also possible that the next round of raises could start with a firm outside the Fab Five — such as the aforementioned Quinn Emanuel, which likes to shake things up and has the money to do it (profits per partner of [$4.4 million in 2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/), second only to Wachtell Lipton).

Readers, what do you think? Take our reader poll:

Who will lead the next round of Biglaw base salary raises?

# Biglaw Firm's Representation Of Porn Client Lands Them In Hot Water With A Judge... Again
## When you have over 2,000 cases on behalf of the same client there's bound to be deadline-based shenanigans.

We’ve written before about Fox Rothschild and its… [unusual representation of porn studio](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-firms-staggering-work-on-behalf-of-a-porn-studio/), Strike 3 Holdings. Over the last few years, the Biglaw firm has filed thousands of copyright lawsuits on behalf of Strike 3, which were overwhelmingly against John Doe porn downloaders. The cases are more than just vaguely titillating cocktail party fodder, they’ve also helped the firm earn the ire of U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth of the District of Columbia who said their client, Strike 3, [“treats this court not as a citadel of justice, but as an ATM.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/biglaw-firm-gets-benchslapped-over-controversial-representation-of-porn-company/?rf=1)

In separate cases filed in California state on behalf of Strike 3, Fox Rothschild, led by partner Lincoln Bandlow, must now argue to Magistrate Judge Carolyn Delaney why they shouldn’t be sanctioned $250 for missing deadlines in a bunch of cases. Which is exactly the kind of deadline-based shenanigans one might anticipate when you file 2,185 cases in 2018.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/02/19/fox-rothschild-partner-faces-sanctions-hearing-over-porn-copyright-cases/) Law.com, it seems Fox Rothschild failed to filed status reports in at least 15 cases, though 25 cases are at issue, within a 45 day period. They’re reportedly blaming the error on a combination of technical issues and staff holiday plans:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Bandlow said in court filings that Strike 3 failed to file the status reports because it had “encountered issues with its calendaring procedure” for cases in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. He also said the filing mistakes were in part due to a lack of staff during the holidays and an inability to receive emails from the court.

Bandlow elaborated on the technical issues to Law.com:

[Bandlow] also said a number of the court’s docketing emails were caught in his assistant’s spam filter, and he had technical issues with the federal court docketing software DocketBird. He said those issues were confined to the Eastern District of California and also confined within Fox Rothschild to his practice.

In an attempt at sanctioning self-help Bandlow said they’ve “sort of sanctioned ourselves in a weird way” by voluntarily dismissing the cases with missed deadlines, wasting the $400 filing fee in the process. He also told the court they’d fix the technical problems before additional cases were filed in the Eastern District of California.

# Biglaw Firms Thinking About 'Cleaning Up' Their Ranks

A lot of chairs feel that slower deal flow, softer economy and softer performance in many firms has a silver lining in that it gives them cover to address areas of weakness in their firm that were harder culturally to address in a strong economy.

What I hear chairs and managing partners indicate is they’re thinking about cleaning up.

— Kent Zimmermann, a law firm consultant with the Zeughauser Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2022/10/24/in-associate-ranks-a-slow-down-in-demand-could-mean-clean-up/) on the potential thinning of the associate herd that could be on the radar for Biglaw firms in light of today’s economic uncertainties. He said firms are looking at “whole offices and practices” when it comes to counseling out weak performers.

Why get a side gig when you can just have your job pay you more money?

I’m sure that thought has crossed the minds of a couple of attorneys working for Shearman & Sterling, a firm that raked in an impressive $861,026,000 gross revenue in 2020. And now that they’ve decided to match Cravath, the associate share of the earnings is gonna grow a bit. Here’s the scale:

Class	Base Compensation
1st year	$215,000
2nd year	$225,000
3rd year	$250,000
4th year	$295,000
5th year	$345,000
6th year	$370,000
7th year	$400,000
8th year	$415,000

Base salaries for counsel will also increase by $50,000.

The monies will be retroactive to January 2nd and should be reflected in paychecks on March 15th.

In the realm of legal expertise and advocacy, the National Association of Women Lawyers’ (NAWL) Annual Meeting is a prestigious platform showcasing leadership, diversity, and innovation. Every year, this pivotal legal event honors professionals who are reshaping the legal landscape, making a significant impact globally. As Lateral Link, a proud sponsor and renowned name in the legal recruiting industry, we are thrilled to spotlight the achievements of the NAWL 2023 Award recipients.

At the centerpiece of this year’s event was an enlightening panel discussion on diversity in legal leadership, an essential driver for the evolution of the legal profession. Guiding this important conversation were experienced moderators, Peggy Steif Abram, NAWL Board of Directors President and retired partner of Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, and Sally Bergmann, influential Partner at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP.

Among the esteemed panelists was legal pioneer, Deborah N. Archer, renowned for her work in social justice as Associate Dean, Co-Director of Clinical and Advocacy Programs, and Professor at NYU School of Law, and President of ACLU. Deborah’s relentless endeavors earned her the 2023 Arabella Babb Mansfield Award, recognizing high-achieving women lawyers who inspire others. We heartily congratulate Deborah on this noteworthy recognition.

We also extend our applause to diversity advocate, Yvette Ostolaza, Chair of the Management Committee at Sidley Austin LLP. Yvette’s work in promoting diversity in law has merited her the 2023 Ashley M. Dickerson Diversity Award, a testament to her exceptional influence in the legal community.

In the same vein, we commend Amy Pannoni, VP and Deputy General Counsel, HR Legal at Microsoft, on receiving the prestigious 2023 NAWL President’s Award. Amy’s leadership in fostering career advancement for women and minorities in the legal sector is indeed commendable.

Our accolades also go to public service stalwart, Elizabeth Prelogar, Solicitor General at the U.S. Department of Justice, who received the 2023 Public Service Award. Her commitment to community service embodies the power of law to effect substantial societal change.

Finally, we congratulate inclusive leader, Alan Tse, Global Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary at Jones Lang LaSalle, on his 2023 Lead By Example Award. Alan’s impactful leadership is a powerful model of the benefits of diversity in law firm leadership.

These award recipients are more than just exceptional legal professionals. Their groundbreaking work, commitment to diversity in law, and exemplary leadership inspire the future of the legal industry. At Lateral Link, we stand by these values, and look forward to continuing our efforts to support and promote diversity and inclusion within the legal profession. We heartily congratulate each recipient on their well-deserved recognition and eagerly anticipate their future contributions to the legal community.

As a testament to the energy, camaraderie, and spirited engagements at the event, we are delighted to share a collection of photos captured by the Lateral Link team who had the honor of attending the meeting. We invite you to enjoy these vivid scenes from the NAWL 2023 Annual Meeting, encapsulating the essence of this inspiring gathering.

# New Opportunities For New York Litigators (Including Outside NYC)
## If you're an associate with superb credentials or a partner with a significant portable practice, you have options, both in Manhattan and Westchester County.

New York City (Photo by David Lat)

After freezing up a bit in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the market for legal talent is starting to warm up. Here at [Lateral Link](https://www.laterallink.com/), a national legal search firm, we’re seeing increased activity in multiple markets. My colleague Abby Gordon recently evaluated the state of the [Boston market](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/the-boston-legal-market-in-the-era-of-covid-19/) and my colleague Jesse Hyde did the same for the [Chicago market](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/an-update-on-the-chicago-legal-market-during-covid-19/), and both noted opportunities in select practice areas.

As a former Biglaw litigator in New York, I work with many litigation candidates, and I have a number of them interviewing with firms right now. I’ll talk about the types of associates who are getting traction with firms right now and the types of partners that firms are seeking.

On the associate side, Biglaw firms aren’t doing much hiring right now, but elite litigation boutiques are quite active. Litigation hasn’t slowed down as much as transactional practice during COVID-19, so many boutiques are busy — and looking to add to their ranks.

The tough part about the elite boutiques is that they’re more selective than many of their Biglaw counterparts. The candidates that I have in play with the boutiques have these credentials:

- Very good grades from a top 14 law school, or excellent grades from a non-T14 law school (e.g., Latin honors or Order of the Coif).
- One or more clerkships with federal district or circuit judges — the more prominent the court or the judge, the better (e.g., S.D.N.Y. or E.D.N.Y. for district judges, SCOTUS feeders for appellate judges).
- Between two and four years of experience at a top Biglaw firm — the more prestigious the firm, the better.
If you have all of these credentials and would be interested in exploring opportunities at boutiques — where you can get comparable or better compensation, greater and earlier responsibility, and better partnership prospects compared to Biglaw — please email me at [dlat@laterallink.com](mailto:dlat@laterallink.com?subject=Boutique%20Opportunities).

On the partner side, it’s all about books of business these days. There’s no shortage of seasoned litigators with superb credentials and experience, so mere skills won’t pay the bills. In the coronavirus pandemic, firms are being fiscally conservative and conserving cash, so they aren’t in the mood to invest or take risks. Instead, they want partners who will be accretive, who will improve the firm’s bottom line, and who will take the firm’s average profits per partner up, not down.

If you are a partner with a significant portable practice, I have two searches right now that could be of interest:

- An Am Law 100 firm with profits per partner well north of $3 million is looking to add an international arbitration partner or group of partners, in either New York or D.C.
- A superb litigation firm is looking to add partners in Westchester County. If you’re a Biglaw partner who lives in Westchester, works in Manhattan, and is tired of the commute, this could be very appealing.
If you’d like to learn more about either of these opportunities, please email me at [dlat@laterallink.com](mailto:dlat@laterallink.com?subject=Partner%20Opportunities).

Not surprisingly, given what’s going on in the world, the lateral market isn’t nearly as active as usual. But for the firms and the candidates who are willing to look, it’s a time of great opportunity.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Glen Keith Allen

My dues-paying [to the National Alliance] was many years ago. What connections I had, I kept to myself.

I think it’s healthy to identify with your racial past, your ancestors. I don’t think that’s unique to Europeans, or Japanese, or Africans. I do think there’s an amount of identity, pride in your race, that’s not permitted today. I also understand it can be obnoxious and create violence, and that’s not acceptable.

— Glen Keith Allen, a former lawyer with DLA Piper, commenting on race in America following his [recent termination](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/08/19/baltimore-fires-city-government-lawyer-with-seeming-neo-nazi-ties/?hpid=hp_local-news_lawyer-1pm:homepage/story) from the City of Baltimore’s Litigation and Claims Practice Group. Allen was let go after his former ties to National Alliance, a white supremacy group, were made known by the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/08/17/neo-nazi-lawyer-represents-baltimore-suit-over-wrongful-arrest-and-19-year-imprisonment).

In a statement given to the [Baltimore Sun](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-allen-attorney-20160818-story.html), Allen said:

“Whether you believe me or not, I’m not a member of the National Alliance, haven’t been for many years. You cannot find a single person who can say, ‘Glen Allen’ treated me disrespectfully.”

He said of his past affiliation with the group: “I will acknowledge emphatically that that was a huge mistake.”

Louis Lehot

A partner at DLA Piper has released an open letter accusing a senior partner of sexual assault and asking the firm to release her from their mandatory arbitration agreement so she can “assert [her] civil claims for assault, battery, sexual harassment and retaliation in our transparent court system.”

[Vanina Guerrero](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/people/g/guerrero-vanina/) alleges the co-managing partner of the firm’s Silicon Valley office, [Louis Lehot](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/people/l/louis-lehot/), repeatedly sexually assaulted her, beginning shortly after she began working for the firm in 2018. She goes on to allege that Lehot’s position at the firm and “extreme temper” initially prevented her from reporting the abuse:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Less than two weeks into my new job working for Mr. Lehot, I suffered his first sexual assault. This happened in his hotel room on a business trip to Shanghai. I suffered the second assault several weeks later during a business trip to Brazil. By November 2018, I had endured two more sexual assaults, one in Chicago and one in Palo Alto. Having moved my two toddlers and husband that I support financially from Hong Kong to California for this job, I was petrified to believe what was happening to me, much less tell anyone. Mr. Lehot’s extreme temper and angry tirades that include shouting and clenching his fists are common knowledge at the office. Lawyers, staff and admin assistants do everything possible to avoid his wrath. My many attempts to fend off Mr. Lehot’s sexual advances failed.

She goes on to detail the impact of the alleged assaults, both on her career and her health:

Mr. Lehot controls my work and my ability to advance. When I dared to tell him to stop, Mr. Lehot would refuse to speak to me for weeks, threaten to take me off of client deals, and accuse me of underperformance. Horrifically, I later learned that he suggested to numerous men at the Firm, and to certain clients, that he and I were involved in a consensual relationship. After months of Mr. Lehot’s relentless campaign and physical advances, I began experiencing panic attacks and stress related medical conditions that landed me in the emergency room several times.

Guerrero, who also filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleges that Lehot demeaned her accomplishments as an attorney, saying “she was a successful lawyer only because men were attracted to her” and allegedly undermining her career by spreading rumors that “clients and lawyers are ‘uncomfortable’ working with her because of her sexual appeal.” This is despite Guerrero being highly recruited by the firm, and Lehot allegedly telling her as part of the pitch to come to DLA that “‘you’ll be my boss soon.'”

When Guerrero finally complained about the treatment, she alleges she was told by [Sang Kim](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/people/k/kim-sang/), co-managing parter of the firm’s Northern California practices, that it “sounded like a ‘he said, she said’ situation and that the best way to resolve it was for me to ‘talk it out’ with Mr. Lehot and three other senior partners – all men.” She says only a few days after this, she was taken off a major deal.

A firm spokesperson has [responded ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-02/star-lawyer-louis-lehot-accused-of-sexual-assault-in-open-letter)to the open letter and complaint:

“We are aware of these allegations by one of our partners and take them seriously,” said Josh Epstein, a spokesman for DLA Piper. “As soon as we were notified of the allegations, we took appropriate steps to investigate them. This process is ongoing.”

There’s been no word, as of yet, from DLA as to whether they will hold Guerrero to the forced arbitration clause that is a term of employment at the firm. As you may recall, DLA Piper has [come under fire ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/one-biglaw-firm-refuses-to-do-away-with-forced-arbitration-agreements/) for their use of mandatory arbitration, and has refused to do away with the practice[ despite protests](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/law-school-students-are-taking-to-the-street-over-biglaw-firms-with-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/) against mandatory arbitration outside of their office.

# A Summer Associate Got Fired... Is There Still Hope?
## Can someone come back from this?

We often lament that summer associates don’t [royally embarrass themselves anymore](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/can-a-summer-associate-please-blow-a-goat-or-something/). There’s the occasional [unfortunate Slapsgiving](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/did-a-biglaw-lawyer-just-get-slapped-by-a-summer-associate/) or [impolitic request for gym time](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/summer-associate-hopes-firm-meeting-doesnt-interfere-with-gym-time/), but we used to have real summer misadventures.

It really shouldn’t count as a summer associate mishap [until the Coast Guard gets called](https://abovethelaw.com/2006/11/an-update-on-aquagirl-things-are-going-swimmingly/).

Anyway, apparently some summer out there has already gotten canned.

Speculation is now open on what “something I shouldn’t have done” means because getting fired from a Summer Associate job is the adult equivalent of failing Recess.

So to address this Summer’s question, this isn’t a great development for your career, but it’s not necessarily a death knell. Unless the transgression was truly abominable, in which case this 2L should be more worried about “being admitted” than “finding a career in Biglaw.” So let’s assume it’s something serious but not highly unethical. Something like, “got in a fight with a partner because I thought I knew the law better” or “hooked up with an associate against firm rules” as opposed to “embezzled from the trust account.”

First of all, it’s not public knowledge (or particularly salacious) or we’d have received other tips about it. This person didn’t jump into the Hudson River, so no one can hop on the Internet to figure out what ended the summer. That means they can control the narrative on what cut that job short. Obviously this isn’t an invitation to lie — that would raise even more ethical fitness problems — but it means they can get ahead of it. Again, assuming it’s not something wildly disqualifying, one can say, “honestly, I made a mistake borne out of my lack of experience and I accepted the consequences — personally, I think it makes me a better candidate today because I’ve learned…” yadda yadda yadda.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Second, Biglaw is very forgiving for people with good credentials. We don’t know where this 2L is going to school, but assuming a stellar transcript from a good school, firms will take a flyer on a good candidate for an entry-level job.

Third, someone at the firm must still like this person. If there’s advice to give, it’s to reach out immediately to that friendly mid-level or senior and be upfront — assuming the whole firm doesn’t know what happened — and ask them if they’d vouch for you going forward. If a future employer wants to talk to someone at the old firm, be prepared to have someone willing to offer a balanced assessment of the good and the bad.

Take the lumps and press on to 3L interviewing season. It’s a regrettable position to be in, but it’s (probably) not the end of the world.

# It’s The End Of The World As We Know It (So Let’s Talk Zoom)

Almost anyone, myself included, who spent a significant amount of time at any level of competitive policy debate, be it high school or college, likely has a soft spot for R.E.M.’s 1987 song “[It’s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)](https://youtu.be/Z0GFRcFm-aY).” This niche popularity stems from the almost assuredly apocryphal rumor that the lyrics were inspired after a member of the band witnessed some rounds at a high school debate tournament.  The connection would make sense since the cavalcade of horrors of which Michael Stipe sings in what could best be described as a verbal fever dream are, both in text and tempo, similar to what you can hear in the “tournament of lies” across high school and college campuses each weekend.

Sadly, what used to be limited to overtired students and college alt-rock bands can now be found on the front page, or for most people, the app version, of every newspaper in the country. A look at the general state of affairs in the United States at the halfway point of 2020 makes one wonder if we are all actually [a portrait hidden away in a locked room, absorbing the sins of an unaging and outwardly happy alternate United States](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/174/174-h/174-h.htm). The murder of yet another African-American, [George Floyd](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html), at the hands of, or in this case, the knees of, the Minneapolis police has touched off the largest public protests in the past [half century of American history](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/06/george-floyd-protests-family-history-1960s-1980s/612727/). In fact, these protests against racial injustice and police killings have [spread throughout the world](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/george-floyd-protests-world-racism/) with the straightforward message that, unfortunately, goes unheeded by a portion of the population — Black Lives Matter.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In addition, Americans are enduring the [worst economy since the Great Depression](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-slump-is-worst-since-great-depression-will-it-be-as-painful-11589115601) with unemployment forecast to stay at high levels for the foreseeable future. And lest we forget, as seemingly many Americans have, there’s COVID-19, which is [killing](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) hundreds of Americans each and every day.

Earlier this year, I mentioned to a colleague that my theme for 2020 was that “it is only going to get worse.” Prognostication is typically not my strong suit, see, e.g., the 2016 presidential election and every NCAA Men’s College Basketball bracket I have completed since elementary school in which I have Kansas as the eventual national champion — I did turn out to be rather prescient in 2008. However, while there is still six months remaining in 2020, I’m thinking I might have knocked this one out of the park.



Nor does it seem as if I am alone in my pessimism, as “It’s the End of the World as We Know It” [once again charted ](https://news.avclub.com/cool-r-e-m-s-its-the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it-1842359973)on both the iTunes and Billboard Top 100. So in the face of these extraordinary times, it obviously makes sense to … talk about Zoom? Yes, discussing the intricacies of a video conferencing platform seems a bit out of place when the world is, both figuratively and [literally](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/22/weather/siberia-arctic-100-degrees-climate-change-trnd/index.html), on fire, but seeing as how COVID-19 does not seem to dissipate based on collective boredom, we are all going to be Zooming for the foreseeable future.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Like many a [failed media experiment](https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/facebook-online-video-pivot-metrics-false.html), I recently pivoted to video, recording some Zoom interview tips for Vanderbilt Law students. Only those who are enrolled at VLS will get the rare opportunity in 2020 to see me wearing a shirt with buttons, but I can still relay some tips to the Above the Law readership that will hopefully help you stand out in your next Zoom interview.

The ubiquity of Zoom in our pandemic era is so vast, no less an authority than iconic fashion designer Tom Ford used the [pages of the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/style/tom-ford-video-chat-tips.html) to provide tips on how to look one’s best on a computer screen.  Those historical tomes you promised you would finally get to during quarantine — but instead you have been binging 30 Rock on Peacock — are great for elevating a laptop so that the webcam is higher than your head and can be pointed down to your eyes. Ford also noted that lighting is key, thus a lamp in the background or even a selfie light affixed to the computer are vital to ensure that you can be seen during your interview.  A bit of face powder was the final suggestion, but I would say to follow that advice only if you know what you are doing. Legal employers are looking for future attorneys, not amateur clowns.

Surprisingly, the fashion designer did not discuss what people should wear on Zoom calls. Simply put, dress for a video interview in a manner similar to going to an in-person interview. This means not just the portion that will be visible on screen but proper dress from head to toe. While I can understand the desire to pair a shirt and tie with mesh shorts, employers have been known to ask candidates to stand up during video interviews to ensure they are dressed in a manner that indicates the interview is being taken seriously. Even if an employer does not engage in such an admittedly bizarre ritual, there is a significant chance you might have to get up in the midst of the interview, thus displaying the entirety of your outfit. I have to use both my hands to count the number of times since the onset of COVID-19 that I have had to get up during a Zoom meeting to pick up/tend to/deal with one of my kids.

While personal attire is important for a Zoom interview, it is equally important to be conscious of how the rest of what is on camera will look to the interviewer. In the absence of sporting events, [evaluating the Zoom backdrops](https://twitter.com/ratemyskyperoom) of total strangers appearing on TV has now become the great American pastime. Ideally, aim for something professional looking that has slightly more personality than a typical doctor’s office waiting room, while being careful not to go too far in the opposite direction either.  Attempting to secure long-term employment is not the time to deploy pictures from your trip to Niagara Falls as a virtual background. In addition, avoid the hostage-video look, as it is hard for an employer to determine if they want to hire a candidate if the interviewer is spending the entirety of the Zoom call trying to discern if secret messages are being blinked out in the hopes of liberation.

As for the interview itself, eye contact is of vital importance in an actual interview and the same holds true for an interview of Zoom. But remember that your webcam is not located directly on the face of your interviewer. Figure out where your webcam is located and affix your gaze there when answering questions. Next, make liberal use of the mute button. Do not turn on your audio when initially connecting and only keep it on when you are speaking. No need to subject your interviewer to the neighbor’s lawn mower or other background noises. But while the mute button should be frequently used, the same cannot be said for your video option. Avoid turning off your video unless absolutely necessary and make sure to inform your interviewer if you do need to turn it off for a moment.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
While every in-the-webcam frame will be visible to your interviewer, that does not include everything in the room. Take advantage of that and have some notes just off screen to which you can refer. The notes can be as basic as some facts about your interviewer or just how to pronounce the employer’s name. In a typical interview, you might well take notes, and since you are in front of your computer, the natural instinct is to want to type some notes as the conversation proceeds. Avoid that instinct. The sound of your typing will likely be picked up by your microphone, and those staccato keyboard strokes can be remarkably distracting. Go with the tried-and-true paper-and-pen method.

Finally, treat the aftermath of a Zoom interview just like an in-person interview. Thank those who took the time out of their schedule to meet with you, even if they did not speak during the video conference.

Look, I get it. Things are pretty bleak right now. [Everybody Hurts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rOiW_xY-kc).  Conforming oneself to Zoom interview etiquette can seem to be, literally, the least important thing in the world right now. But since the official American policy on COVID-19 is seemingly to just [give up doing anything about it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/06/19/countries-keeping-coronavirus-bay-experts-watch-us-case-numbers-with-alarm/), Zoom is going to play a massive role in the employment prospects for the law school classes of 2021, 2022, and perhaps even 2023. So unless you have some musical talent and can find a college alt-rock band to join right before they become meteoric rock stars, it is probably worth perfecting you video interview technique.

David Dizenfeld

When the world learned earlier this year that billionaire Peter Thiel was [secretly financing](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/why-this-billionaire-used-litigation-finance-as-a-weapon-in-his-war-against-gawker/) Hulk Hogan’s [litigation against Gawker](http://dealbreaker.com/2016/05/peter-thiel-revenge-litigation-finance/), some observers of the media industry wondered if it might become a trend. Could wealthy individuals or organizations start using litigation as a weapon to punish or to deter free speech they might not like?

Whether this happens remains to be seen. But it’s worth noting that some jurisdictions have laws specifically designed to protect against such abuses of the system. I recently chatted with Los Angeles lawyer David Dizenfeld about these “anti-SLAPP” laws, which exist in many states and might soon become federal law.

DL: The slaps that most Above the Law readers are familiar with are, well, benchslaps. Can you explain for folks not familiar with it what a “SLAPP” is?

DD: SLAPPs are Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. They are meritless lawsuits intended to bully and silence truthful free speech. While legitimate litigation serves to right a wrong, the primary motivation behind a SLAPP is to quiet the lawful exercise of First Amendment rights, along the way clogging the courts with frivolous lawsuits.

DL: You have come out in support of H.R. 2304, the proposed [SPEAK FREE Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPEAK_FREE_Act_of_2015). Can you describe for us what the Act would do and why it’s important?

DD: Anti-SLAPP protection is available in California and to varying degrees in about 27 other states, D.C. and Guam. As such, there is need for federal anti-SLAPP protection to help promote some uniformity across state lines and avoid forum-shopping.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
DL: Can you tell us a bit about your own interest in, and experience with, strengthening anti-SLAPP laws?

DD: A declaration filed by Arent Fox LLP on behalf of a deep-pocketed client, the Los Angeles Jewish Home for the Aging (“LAJHA”), unwittingly revealed that Arent Fox and LAJHA arranged on or about January 15, 2010, to file a lawsuit against substantiated whistleblowers, well before alleged causes of action were even purported to have occurred — a lawsuit in search of causes of action.

Weeks later, an email inquiring as to LAJHA’s withholding of glucose test results from an 86-year-old diabetic resident and her daughter — namely, my girlfriend’s mother and my girlfriend — was sent to LAJHA’s COO, copying our attorney. Within less than a week, Arent Fox filed a defamation action against us for that email communication with our own attorney, an action that was subsequently ruled to violate California’s anti-SLAPP law. (Here is a [copy of my statement](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SLAPP_H.R.2304_Statement_Hearing-6-22-16.docx) entered into the Congressional Record by Chairman Franks during the House Judiciary Committee / Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice [hearing on H.R. 2304 SPEAK FREE Act](https://judiciary.house.gov/hearing/examining-h-r-2304-speak-free-act/) (at 23:39), which contains more information.)

DL: So the defamation claim filed by Arent Fox against you got stricken under California’s anti-SLAPP law. What happened in the rest of the litigation?

DD: As reported in Chris Morran’s [Consumerist article](https://consumerist.com/2016/06/30/how-one-email-set-off-a-6-year-legal-battle-with-no-end-in-sight/) and as you can see in various court filings, in addition to their calamitous defamation SLAPP being stricken, the rest of Arent Fox’s lawsuit on behalf of L.A. Jewish Home was unconditionally dismissed in its entirety, after they prolonged it for over three years, even trying to continue start of trial at the end. Due diligence and reasonable investigation could have avoided time-consuming and expensive litigation and fall-out from all of Arent Fox’s causes being stricken or dismissed, leaving client L.A. Jewish Home vulnerable to consequences. For example, certainly Arent Fox knew or should have known that no probable cause exists in California for filing a civil harassment action on behalf of a non-natural person.

DL: Most of our readers here at Above the Law are lawyers, and many of them are litigators who file lawsuits for a living. Is there any danger of anti-SLAPP laws going too far and chilling the filing of legitimate lawsuits, the bread and butter of plaintiffs’ lawyers?

DD: As Professor [William Simon](http://www.law.columbia.edu/fac/William_Simon) of Columbia Law School sets forth in this [Consumerist article](https://consumerist.com/2016/06/30/how-one-email-set-off-a-6-year-legal-battle-with-no-end-in-sight/), an attorney should take advantage of every low-cost method for fact-checking a complaint before filing: “A chilling effect is desirable to the extent it deters illegitimate cases. If lawyers do their jobs, liability shouldn’t have much of an effect on legitimate ones.”

DL: The need for federal anti-SLAPP legislation does sound compelling. How optimistic are you about the chances of the SPEAK FREE Act being passed in the near future?

DD: The bipartisan support the bill is already garnering in Congress is a hopeful sign that it is gaining traction.

DL: Good luck with this effort, and thanks for taking the time to chat!

# Some Lawyers Offer Interesting Fee Arrangements
## Clients may not be happy with the billable hour fee arrangement since the lawyer and client’s interests may not be aligned.

Perhaps the most common way attorneys bill their clients is by the billable hour. Under this arrangement, the lawyer and client agree to a rate the lawyer shall charge the client for an hour of the attorney’s time, and the lawyer records her time and invoices the client for the amount owed. Clients may not be happy with the billable hour fee arrangement since the lawyer and client’s interests may not be aligned, the client might not be able to expect how much she will need to pay for legal work, and for other reasons. In recent years, many law firms have begun to offer alternative fee arrangements to be more equitable to clients and to better align the interests of attorneys and clients. Throughout my career, I have heard of some lawyers offering some unusual fee arrangements that sometimes have interesting consequences for a representation.

One time, I was working at a firm that mostly handled mass torts cases in one particular mass tort. There was a firm that represented numerous defendants in this mass tort, and attorneys at that firm would routinely attend depositions representing five or more clients. The rumor was that clients of that firm agreed to be charged a bargain basement low hourly rate that might not have even cracked triple digits per hour. In exchange, the clients agreed that the firm could also work for other clients for the same appearance and each client would be charged that same low rate even if other clients were simultaneously represented at a deposition, court conference, or other appearance.

I am not sure of the ethical implications of such an arrangement, and I leave that question to better minds than mine. What I can say is that this sometimes made it difficult for attorneys at that firm to handle issues for all of their clients. Sometimes, the lawyers would even forget who they represented, since they had to keep tabs on five or more clients at a given proceeding. However, this arrangement ensured that the client would pay one extremely low hourly rate notwithstanding the circumstances, and clients may feel that there was less of a chance of being overcharged by their counsel with this arrangement.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Some lawyers have hybrid arrangements that combine multiple fee structures in a single representation. Some lawyers charge a flat fee for certain types of legal work so that clients and lawyers can set expectations about how much money will be charged for legal work. One time, I worked at a law firm that agreed with a client that for a certain stage of the litigation, the client would only pay a flat rate. If the case proceeded past that stage of the case, then the client would be charged at a reasonable hourly rate.

This created some perverse outcomes in our representations. For instance, when the case was in the flat fee portion of the representation, the firm did not go the extra mile in the representation, and we would usually double-book court appearances and take other steps to save money. However, once the case was past the point when we could start charging by the billable hour, attorneys would work up cases more. To the extent practical, I got the feeling that some attorneys waited until they could charge by the billable hour to complete certain tasks. In any event, the law firm was more flexible than others in how they structured fee arrangements, and this led to some unique outcomes in the representation.

When it comes to contingency cases, some lawyers take an interesting approach that perhaps more lawyers should consider. Usually, when a lawyer takes a matter on contingency, there is one flat contingency rate that is charged no matter when the matter resolves, and this is typically one-third of the recovery. However, sometimes lawsuits resolve early in the litigation, while other times, lawsuits are not resolved until a jury renders a verdict. It might seem unfair for a client to fork over a third of a recovery if the lawyer merely wrote a few letters and made a few phone calls, and some lawyers structure fee arrangements to deal with this situation.

I once worked at a law firm that broke down contingency percentages based on when the litigation was resolved. If I am not mistaken, the lowest amount that could be charged was 15% of the recovery if the case settled early and 40% of the recovery if the case was resolved after trial or on appeal. Of course, some states have mandatory maximums for contingency percentages in certain types of cases, but such nuanced contingency percentages could bring more fairness to a contingency representation.

All told, everyone should do their research to see if the fee arrangements discussed in this article are ethical in the jurisdictions in which they practice. However, lawyers should be more creative with their fee arrangements so that they are fairer and better align the interests of attorneys and clients.

# Biglaw Firm Admits It Botched Handling Of Sexual Assault Allegation Against A Partner
## Baker McKenzie 'regret[s]' how they dealt with the incident.

Baker McKenzie released a joint report last week that admits the way the firm handled the alleged sexual assault by a partner at the firm involved “a number of shortcomings… which we very much regret.”

Well, yeah. For those that don’t remember [the story](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-firm-admits-to-sanctioning-partner-after-sexual-harassment-investigation/) from earlier this year, a partner in the firm’s London office was accused of assaulting an associate after a firm event six years ago. The associate reported it to the firm, and they investigated. But instead of getting rid of the offending partner, the firm just sanctioned him and reached a settlement with the associate who was victimized. It was only after the story became public that the firm bowed to pressure and the accused partner [left the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-firm-under-investigation-for-failing-to-disclose-partners-alleged-sexual-assault-to-regulators/).

The joint report, done by a committee of senior firm officials along with Simmons & Simmons, looked at more than just the incident in question, instead focusing on what allowed it to occur and what needed to change at the firm, as [reported by](https://www.law.com/legal-week/2018/10/11/simmons-report-finds-shortcomings-in-baker-mckenzies-handling-of-sexual-misconduct-incident/) Legal Week:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Bakers said the review was “global in scope” and had “considered what measures, mechanisms and processes the firm should have in place to ensure such matters are dealt with to the highest standards, by considering the protection of complainants, appropriate confidentiality in the interest of the complainant, due process, disciplinary measures, firm governance, institutional knowledge-sharing and achieving the highest ethical standards within the firm.”

Bakers’ statement added: “Simmons commented that as a firm we had been particularly open and transparent in our desire to ensure that we got to the root of the problem and to learn from our mistakes.”

The firm noted that the process has been a challenging one, but one that was absolutely essential, saying, “None of this has been easy, but it’s been a necessary period of reflection and self-assessment.” The good news is that change is coming to Baker McKenzie:

The firm will bring in a ‘First Point of Contact’ role in an effort to ensure that all its offices have a number of trained people “who are available in person as a first point of contact for questions or concerns regarding inclusion, respect at work or breach of a policy”.

Bakers also noted that during the past six years it has taken proactive measures including rolling out a firmwide code of business conduct and an independent reporting hotline,  implementing enhanced mandatory training on conduct and ethics, and creating a role of chief people officer to take on diversity and inclusion-related responsibilities.

The firm is still being investigated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority over their handling of the incident.

# Bonuses Continue To Rain Down On Magic Circle Associates
## Lots of money Brexiting to the U.S.

We’ve now heard from everyone in the Magic Circle that plays in America. As one might expect, Allen & Overy joined [Linklaters](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/the-first-magic-circle-firm-pulls-money-out-of-its-hat/), [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-fat-chance-this-match-wasnt-going-to-happen/), and [Freshfields](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/associate-bonus-watch-theres-magic-in-the-air-as-international-firm-matches-cravath/) in adopting the Cravath bonus scale for their associates. Slaughter & May, of course, eschews placing an office in the Colonies.

This is surely the biggest story of the English reaching out and offering a lifetime of riches to an American this week.

As per usual, we’ll show you the Cravath scale in case you haven’t had it tattooed on your forearm yet:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Class of 2017 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $15,000
Class of 2015 — $25,000
Class of 2014 — $50,000
Class of 2013 — $65,000
Class of 2012 — $80,000
Class of 2011 — $90,000
Class of 2010 — $100,000
Class of 2009 and more senior — $100,000

Hopefully this bonus will go a long way to shoring up morale after a young associate was [hospitalized with exhaustion](https://www.legalcheek.com/2017/12/allen-overy-moves-to-reassure-junior-lawyers-after-rookie-is-hospitalised-with-exhaustion/) this week.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

You’ve had your fun. Now go get drunk at lunch and throw up in a partner’s office.

We’re not encouraging bestiality — necessarily — but seriously, can someone living the life in one of America’s top Biglaw firms just do something wildly embarrassing? The summer is racing toward conclusion, and it’s been a complete snoozer. We put our faith in you, the youth of this industry, to take massive stockpiles of privilege and copious amounts of alcohol and give us something truly great. Instead you’re just “working,” like “professionals.”

Goddamned millennials.

Make no mistake, we don’t need a summer associate scandal to boost traffic around here. In fact, traffic is the opposite of the problem. We can get traffic numbers by the bushel because every day a tacky, gold-plated buffoon has another high-stakes collision with the law. If he’s not [firing reshuffling his lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/kasowitz-checking-out-of-russiagate/), he’s [picking fights with his Attorney General](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/jeff-sessions-is-totally-pissed-at-trump/), or throwing his administration [into the maw of the ACLU](http://www.theonion.com/article/breaking-aclu-hard-fucking-rock-right-now-56490), or populating the Sixth Circuit with [anti-gay bloggers](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2017/07/20/senate_confirms_john_k_bush_anti_gay_blogger_to_the_6th_circuit.html). Seriously. Dear Democrats, if you every figure out how to get back in the White House, I’ll be expecting a Second Circuit seat for being “not-a-bigoted-prick blogger.” It seems only fair if this is what’s passing the vetting process these days.

But it’s all so wearying. Of course it’s newsworthy and it’s important, but just give us something — anything — else. Let me break up the day with a summer mooning the rest of the firm. The only summer associate scandal we’ve had this summer involved a summer [allegedly making racist remarks on the job](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/summer-associate-allegedly-fired-for-making-racist-remarks/) and let’s be honest, that’s not far enough from the daily Trump beat.

I know the legal market has changed, and the heady days of devil-may-care summer associates may be lost to history, but someone out there has to still have a bit of the old firebrand in them. Perhaps these summers just lack inspiration? Fair enough. Let’s review some ACTUAL INCIDENTS in summer associate history:

* Some [mild flashing](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/is-this-really-a-summer-associate-scandal/). Thankfully the firm seems to have recognized that this wasn’t a scandal as much as a teachable moment. Still, even minor incidents like this aren’t bubbling up this year.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
* There was the woman who took off her clothes and [jumped into the Hudson River](https://abovethelaw.com/2006/11/an-update-on-aquagirl-things-are-going-swimmingly/)? Right the f**k off Chelsea Piers. The Coast Guard had to fish her out. And she got an offer, so maybe the rest of you should loosen up.

* A mistaken-identity [slapping incident](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/did-a-biglaw-lawyer-just-get-slapped-by-a-summer-associate/). Sure. “Mistaken identity.” Yeah, there’s no way a summer would want to slap a full-time lawyer. Nope.

* Creating a [love triangle with a junior associate and the managing partner](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/we_know_what_you_did_last_summer) of the firm. Frankly, the only problem here is she got caught.

Look, maybe you have no stomach for creating a scandal. Then just [abruptly quit to go farming](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/06/a-summer-associates-premature-departure-i-would-rather-be-farming/). That’s a perfectly viable story at this point. If you don’t send me something like that in the next hour, I’m really going to have to stare into the abyss of Scaramucci’s Twitter feed. Don’t put me in that position.

And don’t think this is all on the summer associates. Full-time attorneys can definitely lend a helping hand by devising [bizarre sexual exchanges](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/05/a-summer-associate-hook-ups-poll-the-criss-cross-stratagem/) or start [hiding guns in the office](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/06/summer-associate-stories-what-to-do-when-you-find-the-office-gun/) for summers to discover.

# Why Lawyers Are Obsessed with Rankings

Isn’t it nice knowing when you’re objectively better than someone else?

That’s the implicit promise of the ranking systems that we lawyers love so much. Whether you prefer Am Law, Vault, U.S. News & World Report, or even [Above The Law’s](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firm-rankings/top-law-firms/) own humble ranking system, there’s no shortage of “definitive” lists of which law firms and law schools are hot, and which are not.

You don’t get this many competitors in a single space without a strong appetite in the market. By all appearances, we lawyers want desperately to be ranked against one another. There are likely several reasons for this, but a large part of it, I suspect, is how difficult it is to otherwise get any sense of where someone’s firm or school stands in the industry as a whole. We deal in an abstract space, with very few clear indicators of who’s standing out consistently, who’s falling behind the pack, and who may have just had a particularly good or bad year.

Given how hard it is to [accurately assess how our peers are performing](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/biglaw-is-turning-associates-into-george-costanzas/?rf=1), it can be comforting to look at a very long, very official, very objective list and know that everyone sitting lower on the list than yourself is a lost soul who isn’t #winning at life nearly as hard as you are.

Our jobs are stressful, and I’m not here to take away anything that gives someone pleasure or relief from a notoriously difficult career path. But may I also suggest we take a deep breath and think about what a high ranking in the narrow legal world means against the larger backdrop of our business and culture?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
A long time ago, just at the edges of living memory, Kevin Costner was a bankable movie star. One of his early breakout roles was in Bull Durham, starring Costner as a long-serving catcher in baseball’s minor leagues. By the end of the movie, Costner sets the record for most home runs hit by a minor league player. The moment is bittersweet in the movie, however, because it highlighted the length of time Costner spent failing to make it to the majors.

I mention this movie not just because it’s a stone cold 80s classic, but because it highlights the point that being the top in your field might not mean all that much in the larger picture. The legal industry, made up of thousands of law firms, is a small piece of American productivity. The biggest firms in the world make just over $3B in revenue a year, and the top [200 largest law firms combined ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_law_firms_by_revenue)come to about $136B. That’s just over half of what one company, Apple, made in 2018. The fact that one company on its own nearly doubles the performance of an industry that charges hundreds of dollars an hour should be a sobering reminder that the world does not begin and end with law.

Consider also, many people will read this article on an Apple device, and millions more will use an Apple product today to stream music, conduct business, or flick birds at a precarious tower constructed by ill-tempered pigs. Whereas we lawyers will mostly move paper and emails around until someone pays someone else money.

The Other Kind Of Bull

Apart from our fancy clothing and general failure to sweat during work hours, there are surprisingly few structural differences between a lawyer and a plumber, ditch digger, or any other blue collar contractor. We are laborers, generally paid by the hour. We’re constantly in search of our next gig or our next regular client. Our customers aren’t qualified to do what we do, but nevertheless think they know our jobs better than we do.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The biggest difference between a lawyer and a blue collar worker is that at the end of the day, a plumber can point to a newly working toilet and say they made a physical difference in the world. As lawyers, the world at 5 p.m. generally looks about the same as it did at 8 a.m., give or take a few slips of paper.

The world needs lawyers, just like it needs plumbers. If the apocalypse strikes tomorrow, though, which category of laborer would you rather have in your crew? Brief-writing skills and finely honed arguments aren’t going to be quite as valuable as someone who can keep the water flowing.

Changing The World… Or Not

There are few, very few, lawyers and law firms out there working to change the world on a daily basis. Most of them are underpaid and underappreciated, working in the government or at NGOs. Biglaw firms, apart from the tiny fraction of hours they spend on pro bono work, aren’t generally innovating the next great steps of human and business achievement. We’re usually a step or two removed, working for those great innovators and risk takers, helping that next big step happen.

Don’t get me wrong, there’s real value in what lawyers do. The world needs facilitators and middlemen, and lawyers are highly skilled, highly trained, and many are highly paid. Bull Durham wasn’t a movie about Kevin Costner hitting home runs in the minors. At its heart it was a story about Costner’s character mentoring a young, talented pitcher and getting him ready for the big leagues.

Know Your Role

The law is a grand and justly hallowed thing. The legal industry, not so much. We tend to make a lot of money, and we get some pretty good movies made about us, but our market sector as a whole could often use a bit of an ego check. At our best, we help make the larger, more impactful parts of the world work better. The biggest law firms in the world are still just bit players in the overall market.

So feel free to read the rankings and be proud when your firm or school moves up. Absolutely email your friends when their law school drops below yours. Enjoy them for what they’re worth, which isn’t much. Then pick up your golden wrench and get back to work. There’s pipe to lay and clogs to clear, and we’re lucky to be the ones who get to do it.

# Law Firm Says Family/Medical Leave No Excuse For Not Logging On To Do Some Work Every Day!

For most folks, the term “leave” means to leave. Even in the workaholic, billable hour model of Biglaw, people expect that when they invoke family or medical leave they will actually get to leave their job and deal with whatever issue they have to deal with.

One Biglaw firm recently took an opportunity to disabuse attorneys of this notion, reminding them that family and medical leave is all well and good, but that there’s more than enough time in the day to look up from your ventilator and do a little work for the firm!

This comes from Pryor Cashman’s Donald Zakarin, co-chair of the firm’s Litigation and Music Groups and the M+E Litigation Practice:

On the one hand, this is some truth here.

The firm owes its lawyers leave, but a a licensed attorney’s professional and ethical obligations run separate from employment. A client’s malpractice claim doesn’t really care if the lawyer missed that deadline because of leave or incompetence. Courts are out here [actively denying scheduling changes for pregnant lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/pregnant-dont-plan-on-practicing-before-ohios-supreme-court-any-time-soon/), if you want a sense of how the gatekeepers of the profession perceive the issue. It may not be right, but it’s reality and firms can’t have anything slip through the cracks.

But on the other, more accurate hand… this is 100 percent the firm’s problem and not an individual attorney’s. Historically, when correspondence came in through the mail or over the phone and got intercepted by admins, lawyers didn’t have to deal with this problem on leave.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Family and medical challenges aren’t any less difficult just because law firms spent the last 20 years going digital and laying off secretaries.

Firms have a whole host of straightforward measures they can take to keep clients protected when an individual attorney goes on leave. Checking email is actually one of the simplest. Verify that other attorneys in the firm are listed to receive ECF notifications! Set up an out-of-office notification at the administrative level! Have an “out of office” admin on call who is cc’d any time that message is triggered and can then perform any needed followup!

Even better, automate the process so emails related to specific matters get forwarded to appropriate team members! I mean… have you ever heard of [ZERO](https://zerosystems.com/)? They’ve been doing this for a long time at this point. Treat leave like the firm would [treat an attorney leaving the firm](https://zerosystems.com/ai-powered-lawyer-offboarding/) and employ systems that identify the subject based on the addressees and the context and then pushes messages where they need to go.

Speaking of professional obligations, this is part of why attorneys join a firm in the first place. Lawyers congregate with other lawyers so they don’t don’t have to sit staring at their child in the NICU or schedule a funeral for their spouse and keep stepping away to sort through 200 emails in case ONE relevant email went SOLELY to the attorney on leave. Even if the situation isn’t dire, someone trying to care for a two-week-old already has a full plate of overneedy whining to deal with without worrying about a client.

Depending on individual attorneys to do this kind of work during leave isn’t just bad for the lawyers, it’s bad for clients. You don’t WANT to leave it to a human being dealing with whatever the issue is on leave to figure out their email. You owe it to the clients to deploy system-level procedures instead of banking on, “Yo, Cindy, if you aren’t too busy with that broken leg, can you take a second to VPN in and methodically check all your messages in case you missed something?” The firm’s obligation — to clients and attorneys alike — is to figure out how to serve clients even when an individual lawyer isn’t available.

Asking the lawyer to check email on leave is, admittedly, one solution. But as solutions go, it’s a bad 1997 answer to a 2023 problem.

# BIGLAW BONUS SEASON BEGINS!!!
## We're off and running.

It’s become cliché to complain that the Christmas season has fully eclipsed Thanksgiving. As if you’re somehow going to end up short a turkey leg just because your neighbor put up lights already. Stop complaining that Thanksgiving has become the leadoff hitter of the holiday lineup and just embrace it.

That’s what Baker McKenzie seems to be doing, announcing its annual bonus scale. This is [the second time](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/enough-with-the-bad-news-biglaw-bonus-season-is-almost-here/) Baker McKenzie has kicked off the season, having announced first in 2020 and the firm is making younger associates very happy, upping last year’s starting level bonus starting the range at $20K unlike its peers, which is in line with its policy last year.





The prevailing market scale last year ran from $15K to $115K so this is a nice gesture for the cub lawyers out there. We’ve heard plenty of speculation that firms might try to tie bonuses to associates getting back in the office. Thankfully that’s absent from this memo.

Though it’s not all good news. Baker McKenzie still sets its minimum billable hour expectations at 2000 for the year. Which in normal times isn’t that hard to hit in Biglaw, but with an economic speedbump hitting in 2022, there are probably a lot of associates out there simply unable to find enough work to get to the target. This may become a theme as we work through the season.

Will this be the final word on bonuses? Will another firm go over the top? We may have answers before Thanksgiving!

See, isn’t it great when we get started on the holiday season early?

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Sometimes Christmas strikes twice.

[Last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/katten-bonuses-21/), Katten Muchin Rosenman announced its year-end bonuses. Money is a great way to say thank you, after all. Said thank you even came with additional party favors for employees whose hours met the firm’s 2000 hour mark.

The pot is even sweeter now that they are also matching the special bonus wave brought in by [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/).



It’s a pretty penny! Here’s the part where I tell you to put it toward your student loans. But hey, you know what else is cool? Uber Eats — especially if you’re working home. Be sure to tip your drivers at least 20%!

We like hearing about bonuses almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

[UPDATE: Originally we said this would be given to those who exceeded expectations, but we’ve been told the 2000 hour threshold is the base billable target]

# Your Guide To The ‘Buy And Build’ M&A Strategy
## A deep dive into what it is and why everyone seems to be doing it.

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) defied gravity in 2021, and while 2022 has been slower, figures are healthy. Moreover, one of the most popular strategies continues to be Buy and Build (B&B).

A recent on-demand CLE program from the Practising Law Institute (PLI), [Introduction to the “Buy and Build” M&A Strategy: What It Is and Why Everyone Seems to Be Doing It](https://www.pli.edu/programs/introduction-to-the-buy-and-build-ma-strategy--what-it-is-and-why-everyone-seems-to-be-doing-it?t=ondemand&tCode=CNS2_ATL02&utm_source=ATL02&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), is moderated by Joe Ehrlich, the National Practice Leader for Private Equity and M&A at Brown & Brown, and features top professionals in the M&A space discussing B&B’s risks and advantages.

How popular is it? In 2021, B&B accounted for nearly 70 percent of deals.

According to Eric Tajcher, a partner at Morgan Lewis who counsels businesses on U.S. and cross-border M&A, this is “not particularly surprising” as companies are looking for ways to improve their market share.

What It Is

The program materials define B&B as “a strategy employed by private-equity-backed companies in which the company seeks to expand and extend its operations through strategic add-on acquisitions of other companies in the same sector or adjacent sectors.”

A key aspect is “an opportunity to consolidate in a fragmented industry,” says Brian Kirkpatrick, president of Universal Engineering Sciences, whose firm has grown via an aggressive M&A strategy backed by PE sponsors BDT Capital and Palm Beach Capital.

The goal, of course, is to create a stronger company.

“This may mean reducing overhead or rationalizing functions,” says Frank Finelli, Managing Director at the private equity firm Carlyle. “What can these two companies do together that they can’t do alone?”

Although B&B differs across sectors, a common goal is to find cost and revenue synergies to strengthen the company and then sell it “at a [higher] EBITDA Multiple [than what was paid],” Tajcher says. The EBITDA Multiple is a way of looking at a company’s profitability on a normalized basis. It is frequently used to value business. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

“Some clients are looking to expand geographically,” he continues, “and others are looking for services or products that are complementary so they can cross-sell.”

Another goal — less common but particularly happening in tech — might be to “take on a talent pool.”

Why Everyone Seems to Be Doing It

In the PLI program, the panelists go on to discuss various drivers behind B&B activity. One is “dry powder” in the hands of private equity, the term for the amount of undeployed capital that has been committed to private equity funds. 

In 2021, dry powder exceeded $3 trillion. “That’s a big number,” says Finelli. “We’ve seen broader classes of investors getting involved. Private Equity is a useful asset class for investors trying to maintain a diversified portfolio and B&B is a useful value creation strategy.”

“They’re going to want to deploy that capital sooner rather than later,” Tajcher adds. “The activity is still robust.”

Other drivers mentioned in the materials include ESG (environment, social, governance) trends and the rise of ESG-related companies, plus an inventory of high-quality targets, excellent price-to-earnings ratios, and aging business owners.

Getting Your B&B Right

Identifying the right target in the right industry sector is crucial, as is negotiating the right deal. An almost dizzying amount of factors come into play.

“You have to take this situation by situation, company by company,” Finelli says. “It’s hard to effectively integrate these businesses, and it’s risky. You’ve got to be confident you can mitigate risk with the quality management team you have.”

Due diligence is of paramount importance. The panelists touch on the main areas, including insurance, human resources, information technology and data privacy, and financials.

The due diligence period can stir up a number of legal issues. Parties on the target side may be reluctant to share “information about customers and what they’re paying, or intellectual property,” Tajcher says. On the buyer side, parties might be wary of compliance issues at “family-operated companies who might not engage sophisticated, expensive counsel.”

Ehrlich adds: “Your due diligence needs to follow your thesis. Your diligence needs to make sure that the target company actually is going to deliver all of the things that you’re hoping it will, and it’s going to lead to an accretion in value.”

Predictions

Even in this time of market volatility, Finelli is bullish about the prospects for B&B. “I think we’ll drive on at a steady pace,” he says. “There’s just tremendous expertise and good companies out there that give me confidence.”

Tajcher predicts that B&B’s high percentage of M&A deals will hold steady, “at least for the next couple of years,” and Kirkpatrick agrees, calling B&B “a very viable strategy for the long term.”

# Want To Make (Equity) Partner? Good Luck With That

Biglaw partnership isn’t what it once was. That’s not just some weird bout of nostalgia for a bygone era, but hard data that supports the notion that being partner at a Biglaw firm isn’t quite the cushy job of the past.

[According to](https://www.law.com/2019/05/06/data-snapshot-the-path-to-big-law-equity-partnership-is-narrowing/) data collected by ALM Intelligence as part of the Am Law 100 ranking, there have been massive changes in Biglaw partnerships for almost two decade. The percentage of equity partners across the Am Law 100 has taken a tumble, with the percentage of nonequity partners (partners who receive more than half their income on a fixed basis) steadily increasing.

It’s not poor financial performance that is leading to these changes. Financial indicators are up — the average revenue per lawyer for 2018 was up 4.2 percent, and the average profits per equity partner were also up for the Am Law 100, to the tune of $1.88 million, an increase of 6.5 percent.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
But it may be the competition to keep improving numbers that has really made the trend take off:

“I think this is just an arms race,” said Nicholas Bruch, a director and analyst at ALM Intelligence. “In the old days where most firms had collegial partnerships where all you had to do was work long enough and you got into the partnership, what that meant was that some people were being subsidized. ”

“As soon as one or two firms decided that they weren’t going to do that, then everyone basically had to go to that world,” Bruch added.

Even more disturbing is the perception that the [nonequity track is increasingly being used](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/addressing-the-elephant-in-the-room-biglaws-problem-with-diversity/) to pay lip service to diversity and inclusion. This way firms can tout the number of diverse partners, while still keeping profit sharing to only a select few.

# Think You're Getting A Raise To $180K In Atlanta? Think Again...

It’s insane. I was surprised not so much that Cravath did it — but the speed with which the lemmings matched.

— An anonymous managing partner of an Atlanta Biglaw firm, commenting on the [race between firms to match the new Cravath salary scale](http://www.dailyreportonline.com/id=1202760823269/Top-Atlanta-Firms-Hang-Back-on-Associate-Pay-Raises?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL), starting at $180K for first-year associates and ending at $315K for eighth-year associates.

(The [Daily Report](http://www.dailyreportonline.com/id=1202760823269/Top-Atlanta-Firms-Hang-Back-on-Associate-Pay-Raises?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL) contacted several leading Atlanta firms, and many of them are still “deciding” what they will do and “assessing” compensation, like Sutherland Asbill and Troutman Sanders. Others, like Morris Manning, Arnall Golden, Bondurant Mixson, and Dentons, say they will “stay competitive with the market, but they are still deciding what that means.” Kilpatrick Townsend did not respond.)

# 4 Tips For Lawyers To Master The Art Of Productive AI Conversations
## Anybody can interact with a generative AI tool. Getting the results you want, however, is an art unto itself.

In a recent conversation among a group of in-house lawyers, one GC shared how she’d used ChatGPT to write a data processing agreement. “Just 25 prompts later, I had an optimized DPA. I’d saved so much time and effort,” she said.

A skeptic countered, “But ChatGPT doesn’t know anything beyond 2021, and so much has changed with privacy laws since then.”

The GC explained, “That’s part of what the 25 prompts were about. I started with a good DPA template. Then, during a dialogue with ChatGPT, I tweaked the agreement to include company specifics and recent privacy law changes from the past two years. It was well worth it.”

Anybody can interact with a generative AI tool. Getting the results you want, however, is an art unto itself — one we all need to master. Here’s how you, the experienced and trained legal operator, can use the chain-of-thought process to guide conversations with AI language models in ways that help you explore and connect ideas for more productive outcomes. 

AI Language Models Lack Critical Thinking Skills

Though AI language models generate text that is often indistinguishable from human writing, they can’t interpret context reliably or understand language nuances. AI-generated text may sound convincing and well-reasoned, but AI models don’t fully grasp their underlying meaning or implications. They need us to fill in the gaps.

AI language models are trained to pinpoint patterns and probabilities in large datasets not to make value judgments or to take a stance on a particular issue. Because of their training, they reproduce existing patterns and ideas rather than genuinely novel or innovative thoughts. 

By relying solely on AI-generated text, a lawyer might easily overlook important details or make incorrect assumptions. That’s because AI tools lack our human critical thinking skills. 

Analytical Thinking Is A Crucial Component Of The Legal Skillset

In the chain-of-thought process, you inject critical thinking skills into an AI tool’s output, and AI brings creativity to yours. Critical thinking helps you identify underlying assumptions, dissect premises and conclusions, and evaluate the strength and consistency of your and others’ reasoning. 

Human lawyers break down complex situations into smaller parts and systematically examine each aspect to reach rational conclusions. Assessing different possibilities, identifying contradictions, and establishing connections are all essential skills for effective legal practice. 

Through the chain-of-thought process, you systematically introduce critical thinking and legal reasoning into your interactions with generative AI tools. As a result, the tools can tailor more practical and relevant responses.   

Here are four tips for engaging in more productive conversations with AI models using the chain-of-thought process:

Define Clear Goals And Provide Context

You must give the AI model a well-defined context and clear goals to get responses tailored to your specific legal needs. What do you want to achieve? What information does the tool need to achieve this? 

- Identify key concepts or arguments ahead of time and prepare to examine each individually. This helps you keep the conversation on track.
- Break down complex ideas into smaller components for discussion. 
- Begin the conversation with a clear and focused question or prompt.
- Include examples and illustrations of the topic at hand.
- Offer clarifications, explanations, and additional details as needed to help the AI model understand the situation at hand and your goals.
Make Connections Among Various Ideas AI Presents

AI language models identify patterns and connections in large text datasets. In turn, you must do the same when analyzing their output. Does it match up with what you know about the legal issue? Is it consistent with what you have seen elsewhere? 

- Look for common themes or ideas that emerge. What works together? What is the same or similar across different sources?
- Stay open to new insights. Don’t hesitate to challenge your assumptions!
- Examine the output from different angles and viewpoints, and consider alternative interpretations of the data. Ask AI to do the same.
Always use your legal expertise and judgment to determine whether output is accurate and up to date. Double-check sources and cross-reference with outside documents to verify the information.

Structure Follow-Up Questions And Prompts Logically

Remember, you’re in an ongoing dialogue with AI in which you must bring logic and clarity.

- Ask targeted follow-up questions. 
- Request real-world examples.
- Seek clarifications, explanations, and additional details to ensure that you understand the output.
Be specific and frame prompts in a well-reasoned manner to get refined responses that lead to more productive discussions.

Continuously Refine Your Interactions With AI Models

Continue to refine your interaction techniques. AI language models constantly learn from new data inputs, fine-tuning their understanding and increasing proficiency in various areas. Subtle adjustments in your approach can yield better results over time. 

Combining the output of AI language models with your critical thinking skills and legal expertise leads to high-quality legal work that takes all relevant factors into account. AI interaction strategies like the chain-of-thought process can help unlock new levels of productivity and responsiveness that propel your law career forward in exciting ways.

# Baker McKenzie Ditches Attorney Accused Of Sexual Misconduct
## The allegations are shocking.

Biglaw mega firm Baker McKenzie has terminated the employment of tax attorney Stefano Mariani. The move comes as Mariani is facing allegations he sexually assaulted a colleague while a partner at the Hong Kong firm Deacons.

As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-baker-mckenzie-drops-lawyer-accused-sexual-misconduct) Roll on Friday, Mariani’s accuser, identified only as X, said the senior attorney positioned himself as her mentor before using his position to manipulate X:

Mariani began gaslighting her when he invited her to drinks at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and told her how “disgusting” her socks were when she arrived, X alleged.

The aim was to “coerce and control her and leave her with a feeling of inferiority in his presence”, which led to direct sexual harassment in 2021 when the pair were having cocktails together at the Foxglove bar in Hong Kong, she claimed.

Mariani placed his hand on hers “suddenly” and said that “It’s apparent there are feelings here”, claimed X.

When she replied, “Even if there were feelings, there’s nothing to see here”, he came round to her side of the table despite her protestations, physically turned her head “and forcibly kissed her” before telling her “Sorry, that was a bit forceful, wasn’t it?”, according to X.

On the way back to the office he told her, “No one needs to find out about this”, which made her “feel like she was now part of a dirty secret and that she needed to accept blame for the incident”, according to X’s claim.

The alleged abuses escalated from there:

A few weeks later he invited her to his house on the pretext of allowing her “to see his collection of Japanese swords”, then undressed her “without warning” and carried her to his bed where he “forcibly performed oral sex on her”, X alleged.

X’s claim conceded that she then entered into a sexual relationship with Mariani, but stated that “it would be difficult and problematic” to describe it as “entirely consensual”, because at the time X was “very much in the thrall” of the partner, who had “gaslit her with micro-criticisms, self-doubt and descriptions of his power over a number of months”.

According to a Notice of Claim, Mariani also made “vulgar remarks about fellow colleagues,” he “appeared to relish the fact that he had a horrible temper and would often lash out at his secretaries,” and bizarrely boasted about putting a “hamster in a microwave to see what would happen.”

X also alleges she believed that if she didn’t go along with the so-called relationship, “he would retaliate and damage or ruin her ability to continue working in the legal field.”

That was not the end of the abuse Mariani is alleged to have heaped on X:

It also alleged that Mariani compelled X to engage in anal sex after she contracted HPV and was told by her doctor not to engage in vaginal intercourse.

“He did not ask for consent, and he never asked or checked if she was comfortable with what he was doing”, alleged the claim.

Instead “he whispered in her ear ‘Now I can take your last virginity’” and “showed no compassion and encouraged [X] to drink a large amount of red wine” after the act, alleged the claim.

Eventually, X reported Mariani’s behavior to Deacons. The firm updated their code of conduct to clarify “coercive and exploitative relationships will not be tolerated under any circumstances.”

According [to reports](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2023/10/12/former-deacons-partner-hired-by-baker-mckenzie-accused-in-court-of-sexual-harassment/), Mariani was fired from Deacons earlier this year. He was hired by Baker McKenzie three months later.

# Top 5 Reasons Not To Mess With Texas
## Bonus alert: Want an extra $10K just for taking a job at a firm in Texas? Lateral Link can help you out.

Larry Scott

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts by [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Larry Scott](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/189) is a Principal at Lateral Link and oversees attorney placements in Texas. Prior to joining Lateral Link, Larry was an Executive Senior Partner with a national recruiting firm. He worked as an attorney at Jenkens & Gilchrist and also spent time in global accounting firms in the U.S. and internationally, including Hong Kong and Vietnam. He holds a J.D., cum laude, from the University of Houston, a B.A., in accounting, with High Honors, from the University of Florida, and a Masters in Accounting, also from the University of Florida. Outside of work, Larry enjoys fitness and music. He is an avid guitarist who regularly performs at blues jams around Houston.

Cravath announced… now it’s Lateral Link’s turn…

We currently have over 100 active jobs in great state of Texas — so many that Lateral Link has decided to bring back your $10,000 Texas Placement Bonus from now until the end of 2016.

Why Texas you might ask? When you factor in the low cost of living, access to big business, and market rate salaries, it’s no wonder Texas is booming. Most firms are relocating, even prior to taking the Texas Bar. Now, with Lateral Link paying $10,000 to successfully placed candidates in the Texas market, it’s clear the real winners of the 2016 Salary Wars are Texas associates (and those on their way).

What will you do with the extra $10K? You could [audit Matthew McConaughey’s new film course](http://www.nbcdfw.com/entertainment/the-scene/Alright-Alright-Alright-McConaughey-Teaching-Film-Course-at-UT-385229311.html) at the University of Texas, treat yourself to a fancy vacation, or sock it away with the amazing relocation and bonus packages we’ve been seeing.

Here are our Top 5 reasons to make a move to the Lone Star State:

- 60 Am Law 100 firms have a presence in Texas. For those interested in business development and in-house opportunities, there are 54 Fortune 500 companies in Texas, compared to New York’s 55 and edging out California’s 53.
- Austin, Dallas, and Houston regularly rank as top cities for young lawyers, singles, young families, new college grads, and even foodies.
- You can live in a palace. [No, really](http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/10711-Strait-Ln-Dallas-TX-75229/80510797_zpid/).  Real estate in Dallas and Houston is luxurious to say the least, not to mention highly affordable when compared to major coastal cities.
- No state or city income taxes. For those making $180K in NYC, a move to Texas will put an extra $12,000 in your pocket in tax savings alone.
- Texas is home to the Slurpee. Yes, the brain freeze pretty much started here. 7-Eleven’s were founded in Texas in 1927, and Texas businesses are proud of their roots. Plus, we just found you $22K by reading this. Now, that’s a lot of Slurpees.
Bonus: We have also been successful in negotiating signing bonuses of up to six figures for exceptionally credentialed associates. Make that $122,000. You’re welcome, internet.

# The 2022 Outside Counsel Rankings: The Top Law Firms According To GCs
## The law firms clients count on.

To compile our fifth annual ranking of the Top Outside Counsel, we turned to the folks who know best: the clients.

Over the last three months, nearly 500 in-house lawyers from across the country shared their perspectives on the law firms their companies use.

The premise of our survey is simple and direct. We asked two questions: 1) “Which law firms does your company engage for legal services?” and 2) “Please indicate the highest level legal work for which your company will engage the particular firm(s).” The levels of work were defined along a four-point scale:

- Cost-efficient, bulk tasks
- Routine matters
- High-value, complex matters
- “Bet-the-company” matters
The ratings for each firm were averaged and the law firms with the highest average scores made it into our Top Outside Counsel Ranking. Check out the results [here](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2022/).

We’ve got some sad news to report out of Massachusetts today, where a Biglaw litigator who was recently honored for his dedication to pro bono work drowned in a powerful riptide at a Nantucket beach.

[Terrell “Terry” Iandiorio](https://www.ropesgray.com/biographies/i/terrell-j-iandiorio.aspx), 46, was a 2005 graduate of the University of Chicago Law School, and served as counsel in Ropes & Gray’s government enforcement and white-collar practice. Waves on the day Iandiorio died were estimated to be about 12 feet high, and the beach was [closed to swimmers](http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/report_nantucket_drowning_vict.html) due to a high surf advisory issued by the National Weather Service in light of Hurricane Gert. According to reports, Iandiorio was found unresponsive in the water amid a search for a child in distress. The [Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/08/18/nantucket-drowning-victim-remembered-family-man-skilled-lawyer/QQMXYjxYwt2PVGMor2yTyN/story.html) has more information:

Terry Iandiorio

A lifeguard found Iandiorio’s body floating face down shortly after noon Wednesday. He was brought back to shore, where a lifeguard performed CPR on him. He was pronounced dead at Nantucket Cottage Hospital.

“It was a very sad and unfortunate incident,” Nantucket Police Lieutenant Angus MacVicar said earlier this week.

About a dozen swimmers had been caught in a rip current at the beach on the island’s south shore on Wednesday, police said.

[Joshua Levy](https://www.ropesgray.com/biographies/l/joshua-s-levy.aspx), a partner at the firm, released this statement about Iandiorio: “Terry’s kindness, tenacity and thoughtfulness made him the consummate professional, an outstanding enforcement attorney, and a wonderful colleague. [His pro bono work] provided an immeasurable impact on the lives of people in need of legal services at critical junctures in their lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this tremendously difficult period.”

Iandiorio’s brother, Brady, who serves as general counsel at building materials supplier Environmental StoneWorks, said Terry would be remembered as an “outstanding father to his two children, a committed husband, a caring brother and son, and a loving friend to all the people whose lives he touched so deeply every day.” Iandiorio’s family has set up a [memorial fund](https://www.youcaring.com/anniandioriomasoniandiorioandelleryiandiorio-907498) in his name.

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences to Terrell Iandiorio’s family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.

Or perhaps it’s a “Kool” way to end the week. As in McKool Smith.

The firm announced bonuses today and threw in some extra happy news for those associates clocking over 2200 hours this year.

The base bonuses will follow the market standard, while big billers will get individual bump ups. According to the memo the top bonus will come in at $170K.

# Biglaw Firm Proves They're Strong Enough For Associate Raises
## One firm, one compensation scale.

We’re not quite done with associate salary increases quite yet! The latest firm to announce raises is none other than the No. 26 Biglaw firm (according to Am Law) — Reed Smith. The firm took in $1,310,596,000 in gross revenue last year, and looks like they’re happy to share the wealth!

Reed Smith announced today they’re moving to the much ballyhooed $205,000 standard for first-year associate compensation. Though tipsters say what happens beyond the first year remains unclear. The firm says the move is part of a broader salary restructuring that will see the end of regional differences in compensation, which they say reflects how matters at the firm are staffed.

Why, you say? It’s all about recruitment, stupid.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“Our culture and core values are central to who we are as lawyers and as a firm,” said Sandy Thomas, Reed Smith’s Global Managing Partner. “Our 2024 business strategy is focused on excellence and impact, and recruiting the best talent available is critical to meeting our promise of providing our clients with first-in-class legal services.”

A message that was reinforced by Casey Ryan, Global Head of Legal Personnel:

“We are in the talent business, pure and simple. We are committed to recruiting the best talent and helping our people build their careers at Reed Smith. We know that’s how we keep our competitive edge in the market. We also know that quality of life for our associates goes beyond pay. Through Associate Life, we are taking a holistic approach to life at Reed Smith and creating an overall experience that works for our associates.”

If they really want that recruitment message to stick, they best be paying more than just first years market salary. But congrats to the associates that got big raises.

# Biglaw Partner's Lawsuit Over A Restaurant Bill Raises More Questions Than Answers
## This is why people hate lawyers.

In a [live chat](https://live.washingtonpost.com/ask-tom-0215.html#4601890) with Washington Post food critic Tom Sietsema, an anonymous user, claiming to be a senior partner at “one of the DC areas [sic] largest litigation firm which is also one of the best,” boasted of a litigation he anticipates will take down a restaurant.

Let’s set the stage:

Girlfriend and I dined at one of the restaurants on your top 10 list [of DC restaurants]. They asked for a credit card at time of reservation. I gave. We showed up for dinner and with drinks, wine, appetizers, main course and dessert and lets not forget dropped $500. Great until I get my Amex Black Card statement and see two charges from same restaurant. Our dinner and then another charge. I call and its because we ‘No Showed”. I asked them to double check and emailed a copy of the bill. Disputed with Amex. Amex refused to remove charge since this restaurant insists we didnt show despite the $500 charge on my Amex for dinner. I am the senior partner for one of the DC areas largest litigation firm which is also one of the best. Despite at least 20 attempts to resolve we go to court in April. I have countersued. This will not be settled. I fully expect to receive low 7 figures in my countersuit and I will drive this restaurant, its partners, and investors all into Chap 7.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Seems strange, right? Like if all these facts are true, a reasonable restaurant — and the credit card company for that matter — would obviously have resolved the matter well before court. Well, you aren’t alone in being skeptical, Sietsema is similarly baffled by the situation and other members of the chat suggested the original poster could be a hoax:

Needless to say, I’m … fascinated. And confused, because clearly, you ate and drank and paid for the evening. I don’t understand why the restaurant *and* Amex don’t see that. What am I missing?

Also… what attorney “fully expect[s]” a $500 credit card charge (which was the cost of the dinner, the no-show charge was likely less) will result in a million dollar+ verdict? It’s stuff like this that gets people all fired up about trial lawyers. And why the glee in potentially putting a fancy restaurant in bankruptcy? Did they also stab your mom when they refused to refund your money? Is business so slow that it’s a smart choice to spend the time and effort to take a restaurant to court over a few hundred dollars? Just write a scathing [Yelp review](http://southpark.cc.com/clips/pxokpi/my-experience-was-sublime) and be on your way. Time is money (especially when you bill by the hour), and if the OP is truly a bigtime lawyer, the relatively small amount of money this has cost is hardly worth the time.

This is why, despite the[ cultural moment lawyers are having](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/the-day-the-lawyer-jokes-died/), everyone loves to hate the profession.

# Biglaw Firm Introduces 'Diversity Hours' That Count Toward Associate Billable Requirements
## This firm is hoping to make diversity in the workplace a reality.

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to recruit, retain, and promote more minority attorneys. Despite these continued assurances, and despite the fact that a number of firms have made great efforts to improve the stature of their diverse hires in the law, there is still much more to be done. On the bright side, one firm hopes to make its pledge to increase diversity and inclusion a major priority.

Dorsey & Whitney is hoping to make diversity in the workplace a reality by introducing a new “diversity hours” policy. “We’ve long said that we valued diversity and inclusion,” William Stoeri, the firm’s managing partner, said. “We were looking for a way to reward those who put time and effort toward it.”

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/07/23/diversity-meets-the-billable-hour-at-dorsey-whitney/) has some additional details on Dorsey’s new policy:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Just as firms often encourage pro bono work by allowing attorneys to record those hours as billable and count toward an annual goal, Dorsey will now allow diversity-related work, activities and training to count toward billable hours requirements.

The policy is retroactive to January of 2019 and includes up to 50 billable hours to be spent on activities such as attending internal and external diversity educational sessions, participating in the firm’s internal affinity groups or representing Dorsey at client-facing diversity events or trainings.

In a statement released by the firm, Stoeri noted that “Dorsey is committed to creating an enduring, more united and more profitable firm by investing and maintaining a culture in which all individuals can thrive and realize their full potential.”

Dorsey was recently ranked in 141st place for Am Law’s [2019 Diversity Scorecard](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/check-out-the-2019-biglaw-diversity-scorecard/?rf=1), with just 12.4 percent of its attorneys and 8.8 percent of its partners identifying as minorities. Perhaps the Dorsey’s new “diversity hours” policy will help it get started on the right foot, but Stoeri realizes that it may not happen overnight.

“I want to encourage people to work in this area,” Stoeri said. “There are some things we can do internally, but there are also a lot of deep-seeded issues that we need to address as a society,” he said.

Last month, we reported on the [untimely death](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/law-student-found-dead-after-accepting-offer-from-prestigious-biglaw-firm/?rf=1) of Leon Cain, 27, who was a third-year student at Stanford Law School. He’d worked as an SEO Fellow at O’Melveny & Myers, a summer associate at Munger Tolles, and a summer associate at Wachtell Lipton. Cain was found dead on the second-floor terrace of the Woodward Building, a luxury apartment complex in Washington, D.C., shortly after he accepted an offer to join Wachtell as an associate after graduation.

At the time the school reported the sad news to his classmates, the cause of Cain’s death was unknown. A few weeks have passed, and the D.C. Medical Examiner’s Office has now issued its official ruling. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2018/10/11/death-of-stanford-law-student-wachtell-associate-ruled-an-accident/) has the details:


Leon Cain (Photo via LinkedIn)

A Washington, D.C., medical examiner investigating the death of … Leon Cain said Thursday that Cain died of “multiple blunt force injuries” and that his death has been ruled an accident. … According to a statement Thursday from Cheryle Adams, special assistant to the city’s chief medical examiner, the “manner of death was ruled an accident.”

In Cain’s [obituary](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?n=leon-m-cain&pid=190165660), his family refers to his death as a “tragic accident.” They have created a [GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/Leon-Cain-fund-for-black-law-students) to support the Leon Cain Scholarship Fund for Aspiring Black Law Students. Per a statement from Stanford Law, “Leon felt strongly about providing support and advice to younger students of color and was a mentor to many in our law school family.” The law school has also established [the Leon Cain Memorial Fund](https://makeagift.stanford.edu/get/page/makeagift?pgnTPC=399&stp=369&olc=32483&cturl=close) to honor him. A memorial service will be held at Stanford Law on October 14.

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences to Leon Cain’s family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.

# Matching Milbank Is Incredibly Affordable... Don't Believe Anyone Suggesting It's Not.
## You'd be shocked how little it would cost to give associates a raise.

It’s been 20 days since [Milbank announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) that it would increase every associate’s base compensation by $10K. No one has matched. Instead, we’ve been treated to anonymous “leaders” [calling the minor raise tone-deaf and greedy](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/top-biglaw-firm-leaders-criticize-milbanks-money-moves/). It’s [insufferable nonsense](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/the-insufferable-nonsense-biglaw-is-spouting-over-milbanks-raises/), of course. Biglaw will gleefully celebrate gaudy profits per partner numbers in April and then fret about “the math” of issuing a cost-of-living increase in November.

If the American Lawyer wanted to perform a service to the legal industry, it would put out the Am Law 200 on Thanksgiving to place bonuses and — in years like this — raises in their proper context.

The thing is, the “math” is not hard. It’s $10,000 per associate! Clients kvetch generically about not wanting to pay higher rates, but we’re talking about $5 more an hour. And that’s assuming a 2000/hr average for associates and some firms definitely average more.

But even if clients don’t shoulder the entire cost of a match, Biglaw firms have more than enough coming in to raise salaries.

Consider Cravath, who has one-upped Milbank’s raises before. The firm has 299 associates [according to Am Law](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=71&name=Cravath,-Swaine-%26-Moore-LLP), meaning a Milbank match costs the firm less than $3 million. Assuming the firm’s revenue is stagnant this year, it brings in just a shade under $1 billion a year. That makes this raise a 0.3 percent hit. Spread evenly across its 97 equity partners, this is about $31,000 out of the $4.6M PPP average.

Davis Polk, a firm that has gone over the top of Milbank before, has [779 associates](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/law-firm-profile/?id=77&name=Davis-Polk) so it would be on the hook for about $7.8M. But it brought in $1.8 billion last year making it a 0.4 percent increase. Its 167 partners would take a greater hit at around $48K per, but they’re also averaging a whopping $5.5M in PPP so should be able to swing it.

Kirkland would have to cough up 0.3 percent of its revenue to lift its 2000 associates up by $10K. Ditto for Skadden’s 1000 associates. Oh, and I’m not even getting into the situation where international associates aren’t on the same pay scale.

Every way you look at this, raising associate salaries to match what — in real terms — they were making 20 years ago is an easy call.

# Associates May Need To Brace Themselves For 4 Days Spent Working In The Office Each Week
## A fuller return to the office may soon be coming down the line, and associates should prepare themselves ahead of time.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I think things are evolving [toward] ‘I want my people back in the office.’ I think that’s how it’s evolving.

— Brad Hildebrandt, chair of Hildebrandt Consulting, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/12/06/despite-expense-dent-from-pay-raises-law-firms-expect-to-see-rebound-in-transactional-practices/) on the state of the in-office work week for Biglaw firms. The authors of the recently released 2024 Client Advisory from Hildebrandt Consulting and Citi’s Global Wealth at Work Law Firm Group wrote that they “wouldn’t be surprised to see more firms adopt a four-day week” in-office. Right now, just a few top Biglaw firms require four days of in-office work, including Skadden; Ropes & Gray; Davis Polk; Weil; and Vinson & Elkins.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Technology is transforming legal M&A practice and workflow.
In a new Technology in M&A Report, Litera documents some of the technology trends affecting M&A legal teams. Based on research in the US, UK, and Canada, the report shows widespread adoption of software tools specific to M&A practice, and reveals the changing attitudes of M&A lawyers toward the benefits and impact of technology on their work and teams.

Join us on May 18th at 1 p.m. ET detailing what they’ve found.



Led by legal tech journalist Bob Ambrogi, an expert panel will explore:

- How M&A teams have already adopted a wide variety of technologies in their work.
- The increasing use of AI-based tech in this data-rich practice area.
- How technology is reshaping legal teams — and the skillsets behind a successful career in the field.
- How technology is enabling more client-centric service delivery.

# Some Law Firm Perks Are Better Than Making More Money In Certain Situations

Would you work from home if you could?

As many readers of this column are likely already aware, no two law firms are created equal.  Indeed, the culture of a law firm, the work that is practiced by a firm, and other factors all distinguish the experiences of attorneys who work at different shops.  In addition, some firms offer non-monetary perks that might be even more valuable than [making additional money in certain instances. ](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/extra-money-main-job/)

As this website has discussed a length in a number of prior articles, the practice of law has become much more fluid in recent years.  Whereas attorneys used to work at firms full-time, and with strict guidelines about when associates would become partners, many firms are embracing more flexible employment relationships.  Such “of counsel” and other similar arrangements can offer flexibility that might be better than making additional money in some circumstances.  Although many lawyers are usually saddled with student debt and want to work for a shop that pays the most cheddar, certain benefits offered by some firms [might be better than making additional cash in many situations](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/balance-side-hustles-main-job/).

One of the biggest trends in the modern workplace is that more and more employees are permitted to work from home.  Empowering employees to work from home allows employers to realize sizable benefits, since this can help lower real estate costs, and serves as a powerful incentive when recruiting talent.  Furthermore, working from home has a number of advantages for employees as well.

Everyone is probably aware of the lifestyle benefits that can be realized form working at home.  Commuting is usually a painful experience for many employees, especially if you have to take mass transit like I do and are regularly crammed together with hundreds of other commuters.  If you live in many suburban areas, commuting to and from work could easily take an hour or two a day.  However, if you work from home, you do not need to spend any time commuting and can use this saved time in more meaningful ways.

Furthermore, working from home could save you serious money that can be devoted to paying off student loans or achieving other financial goals.  Working from home might mean that you do not need to pay for commuting costs, and if you have to pay for parking and similar expenses when traveling to and from work, this could easily equal several hundred dollars a month.  In addition, working from home also means that you do not need to shell out as much money on dry cleaning, buying lunches, and other similar costs associated with heading to the office.  Furthermore, working from home also means that you might be able to spend less money on childcare, since parents who work from home are usually more available to look after kids.

Many law firms have gotten on the work-from-home bandwagon, and more firms will likely implement such policies.  Remote office technology continues to improve, and more law firms will realize additional savings as the technology gets better.  In any case, even if you made a little less money at a firm with a work-from-home policy, it might be worth it to work at such a shop for financial and personal reasons.

Many firms also have non-traditional attorney tracks that offer improved job flexibility, [which might be more beneficial than making additional money in some instances](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/time-side-hustles/).   Non-traditional work arrangements have existed for as long as I have been practicing law, but I think that such initiatives have proliferated recently due to the expansion of the “gig economy.” In any case, I know of numerous attorneys who are only required to bill a fraction of the normal billable hour requirement of other attorneys at their firms in exchange for a pay cut.  Furthermore, I also know a few lawyers that have loose “of counsel” relationships with shops, and others who only work on certain kinds of matters or during busy times at a firm.

The flexibility of non-traditional employment arrangements can easily make up for the reduced compensation that usually comes with these types of agreements.  Such arrangements [allow individuals to pursue passions](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/freelancing/), such as teaching, writing, and other work.  Also, such agreements can sometimes allow attorneys to only handle certain matters that they enjoy working on the most.  In addition, these types of arrangements might also keep individuals away from the office politics and the corporate rat race that might be the worst parts about working for a firm.  Everyone I know who has an alternate work arrangement seems extremely happy with their circumstances, and this situation could be better than making additional money in certain circumstances.

In the end, the most important consideration for many lawyers when choosing a law firm to work at is the amount of money they will be paid. And for individuals with student loans, it is especially important that they earn the most cash possible to devote additional funds to student debt.  However, some law firms offer certain perks which can be more valuable than earning more money in many instances.

Jordan Rothman is the founder of [Student Debt Diaries](http://studentdebtdiaries.com/), a personal finance website discussing how he paid off all $197,890.20 of his college and law school student loans over 46 months of his late 20s.

# This Biglaw Firm Is Making It Rain April Showers Of Cash On All Associates
## There's no better way to celebrate spring than with some cold, hard cash!

Spring has officially sprung, the weather is finally starting to get nice. What better time for a Biglaw firm to announce that it’s interested in making big money moves for associates?

Earlier this week, Morris Nichols Arsht & Tunnell, a Delaware firm rated as one of the [best in the Mid-Atlantic region](https://vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-in-each-us-region/mid-atlantic#rankings-group-0) by Vault, announced that it would be increasing salaries for all associates and special counsel, effective immediately. Entry-level associates at the firm will now be making $210,000, up $20,000 from the $190,000 they’d been making previously.

According to a [press release](https://www.morrisnichols.com/news-morris-nichols-raises-associate-starting-salary), Morris Nichols is a firm that prides itself on its “commitment to attracting and retaining top-tier attorneys to sustain [its] position as a leading Delaware law firm,” so while nothing is specifically mentioned about salary increases for all other associates, we imagine they must be seeing commensurate raises as well.

So, why did the firm decide to raise salaries once again? Because like all other firms, Morris Nichols wants to take advantage of the lateral market. From the firm’s press release:

“Our ability to attract and retain top-notch associates and special counsel is the cornerstone of our Firm’s continued success,” said Bill Lafferty, chair of Morris Nichols’ executive committee. “Delaware is a remarkable place to practice law, with the best courts and judges in the country and headline-grabbing cases of national significance. By prioritizing attorney recruiting and development, we aim to remain competitive for the best legal talent in the country.”

Better late than never!

This first-year salary bump may not match the Cravath money that’s become the prevailing rate in more major markets ($225K for the Class of 2023, to be specific), but more money is more money, so congratulations to all associates at the firm.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

# How To Use Legal Analytics To Competitively Price Your Services

In an increasingly competitive legal market, how you price your services matters. Particularly as associate salaries [continue to rise](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/salary-wars-scorecard-tracker-2021/), clients are pushing back on billing and increasingly seeking out alternative fee arrangements to the traditional billable hour model.

In order to best use pricing to gain a competitive advantage, you need to first understand all the factors that influence your pricing on a granular level — things like case timing, parties’ track records, potential damage exposure, and more. Legal Analytics from [Lex Machina](https://bit.ly/3w44722) allow you to access the legal data you need to strike the right balance between risk and profitability in order to set rates that keep you at the top of a competitive market.

About Competitive Pricing

While the pricing of legal services is increasingly a competitive factor in clients’ decisions on law firm hiring, it’s also a subjective endeavor. Firms and cases vary widely, so pricing is not simply an exercise in offering the lowest number.

Competitive pricing needs to take into account both the value and the risk involved in the case. Your price ultimately needs to anticipate costs and rewards, not just your competitor’s prices, though it’s important to know what those are, too. The legal industry has become highly data-driven, and your clients will expect you to have data to back up your prices, or they’ll look elsewhere. Legal Analytics gives you the ability to back up your pricing and prove to your clients that you’re the right firm to represent them.

Case Timing

Whenever you take on a new matter, one of the first things your clients will want to know is how long the case will last — after all, time equals money in law. Lex Machina helps you answer that question by giving you in-depth insight into similar matters. You can analyze a vast amount of case data by venue, judge, type of case, and more to see how often those cases reach certain litigation milestones and how long on average similar cases last on the whole.

For example, you can view 12 years of contract cases in the Southern District of New York and find out exactly how many days is the median time to termination or trial. Armed with that information, you can give your clients a much more realistic sense of the lifespan of their cases and also set a price that will be both profitable and realistic for the work anticipated. This will also give you a solid framework for exploring alternative fee arrangements or potential areas for cost savings to come up with a price that pleases both the client and the firm.

Party Track Records

A major factor in how much a case will ultimately cost is how your client and the opposing party approach the case. Some parties almost always try to settle as quickly as possible, while others are intent on fighting to a substantive resolution whenever possible. Obviously, the latter scenario will result in significantly higher legal costs.

With Lex Machina, you can analyze how your client or any other party to a case has typically resolved matters in the past. While every case is unique, this will give a good sense of how long the case will last and what litigation tasks will be involved, which in turn gives you the best basis for pricing your services to account for the time and efforts that will be involved in the case.

Damage Exposure

Another major factor that often influences how much your clients are willing to pay for your services in a given matter is the potential damages they’ll likely either recover or have to pay at the resolution of the case. For instance, if they stand to recover very little, they might be less likely to go forward than if the likely damages are significant. The same goes for how much you can reduce the damages they have to pay if they’re the defendant.

Legal Analytics from Lex Machina includes a wealth of data on damage awards that you can filter according to case type, jurisdiction, and more. You can also see if your case is of the type where attorneys’ fees or punitive damages are typically awarded or not. By analyzing past damages, you can more accurately quantify likely damages and fees for your clients in current cases. Understanding potential exposure can help you make better pricing decisions and help your client understand the value of your services.

Firm Success Rates

If you’re responding to an RFP from a potential client, you’re not the only firm they’re considering. As part of your pricing, you need to show why your firm is the right firm to handle the matter.

With Lex Machina, you can quantify your success rate to your potential clients and empirically compare your outcomes to that of your competitors. Clients want value, and case success is an integral part of that. If you can show that you have a stellar track record in similar matters, and a better track record than the other firms they might be considering, they’ll see the value in your rates and you’ll gain a competitive advantage in a pricing war. 

In the battle to competitively price your services, Legal Analytics is your secret weapon. With Lex Machina, you can quote your clients value, not simply a number. When you can give your clients the data-driven case insights and quotes they want, you create the competitive advantage you need to attract and retain clients.

[Troutman Sanders](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/troutman-sanders/) and [Pepper Hamilton](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/pepper-hamilton/) have [voted to merge](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/01/09/troutman-sanders-pepper-hamilton-vote-to-seal-merger-deal/), creating a 23 office, 1100 attorney Am Law 50 firm they’re calling Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders. The deal will take effect on April 1.

The merger, [which we’ve been tracking for awhile](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/pepper-hamilton-and-troutman-sanders-planning-to-merge/), is actually one of the rare Biglaw mergers that makes a lot of sense. The two firms don’t overlap all that much with only 3 redundant offices to be sorted out and while Troutman was roughly 40 slots ahead of Pepper Hamilton in Am Law’s ratings, the firm’s RPL numbers were in the same ballpark, greasing the wheels for the merger.

When we last discussed the [mechanics of a dying law firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/in-memoriam-to-all-the-law-firms-we-lost-last-decade/), we talked a lot about how overaggressive mergers often kick off the countdown to a firm’s demise. Looking into the next decade, mergers are going to continue to ramp up and the demarcation between the firms that make it and the firms that don’t — putting aside the elite Am Law 25 or so — is likely to be whose mergers make the most sense. Troutman and Pepper think they’ve hit the sweet spot.

# Federal Judge Slashes 'Unreasonable' Biglaw Fee Request

The good news for Biglaw firm Gibson Dunn is that [they won ](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/lbpgogxyqpq/Gayles%20order%20Gibson%20Dunn%20fees%2020230808.pdf)attorneys’ fees ([or attorneys fees or … whatever](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/judge-drops-amazing-700-word-footnote-dedicated-to-finding-proper-legal-terminology-for-attorneys-fees/)) for their client, Peak One Investments, in a lawsuit brought by startup Social Life Network. The bad news is the award is for far less than the elite firm actually charges.

As [reported by ](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/law-firm-gibson-dunns-unreasonable-miami-rates-gut-legal-fee-award-securities-2023-08-09/)Reuters, U.S. District Judge Darrin Gayles found Gibson Dunn’s rates were “unreasonable” in the local South Florida market:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The fee ruling from Gayles upheld a [report](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/byprrlangpe/Torres%20report%20Gibson%20Dunn%20fees%20S.D.%20Florida.pdf) from a federal magistrate who said the rates from Gibson Dunn were above the “prevailing” amount in South Florida. Defining a market rate is a threshold question in fee disputes.

“The court’s task in a fee petition is not simply to award what a local client could be willing to pay for a given superstar lawyer,” Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres wrote in his report.

So… how much *do* they charge over at Gibson? The partners on the case, Helgi Walker out of the Washington, D.C. office and Barry Goldsmith in New York, bill out at $1,785 and $1,815 an hour, respectively. But the firm wasn’t even seeking those eye popping rate — they took a haircut in the fee request, asking for only — lol, yes, only — $900/hr. However, even that proved too rich for Miami, as the court only approved a $700/hr fee.

For their part, Gibson Dunn appears to have a very philosophical approach, focusing on the positives:

Walker in a statement on Wednesday said “the headline here is that we were successful in getting our client awarded almost $150,000 in fees for the plaintiff’s inappropriate and meritless suit.”

The statement said it was “not surprising that a national firm’s rates might be slightly reduced in a context where local market comparisons are being made.”

# Which Biglaw Firm Is Now Offering $105K Clerkship Bonuses?
## Clerkship bonuses have remained stagnant through the recession, but it's time for the market to move.

One of the many benefits of having a federal clerkship is the extra bonus you’ll receive if you decide to head to a Biglaw firm post-clerkship. Though the national average for such signing bonuses is about $50,000, back in 2016, Quinn Emanuel [started a trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/clerkship-bonus-watch-will-75k-become-the-new-standard/) by raising its law clerk signing bonus to $75,000. Several firms [followed Quinn’s lead](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/another-firm-raises-its-clerkship-bonus-is-this-a-trend-in-the-making/), increasing their own clerkship signing bonuses above the national average, and in some cases, [above](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/clerkship-bonus-raises-three-is-a-trend/) even Quinn Emanuel’s new market high.

Since then, things have been quiet on the clerkship bonus market — until now.

Quinn Emanuel has once again raised the stakes when it comes to recruiting the type of high quality attorneys who typically clerk for members of the federal judiciary. In a form letter sent to chambers, the firm touts a signing bonus of $105,000 for clerks who join the firm post-clerkship. This is a huge jump from the $75,000 rate the firm introduced just two years earlier, and an absolutely humongous leap from the $50,000 rate many firms that claim to be “peer” are offering their federal clerks.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Quinn Emanuel recently responded to our inquiry, noting that the letter is accurate, and applies to both Circuit and District Court clerks. In fact, the same information is now listed on the [U.S. Compensation and Benefits page](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/careers/us-compensation-and-benefits/) of the firm’s website, as well as its [Frequently Asked Recruiting Questions page](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/careers/recruiting/frequently-asked-questions/#7).

That letter that’s going around federal chambers contains the following language:

When you consider options to continue your career after your clerkship, we hope you will give serious thought to Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. We are very proud of the large number of law clerks who have come to practice at our firm. We have nearly 200 lawyers who clerked for United States District Courts, Circuit Courts of Appeals and the United States Supreme Court. The experience law clerks receive is invaluable to our practice. That is why we make recruitment of law clerks a top priority and the reason why we pay judicial clerks a $105,000 signing bonus. Clerks who have completed two qualifying clerkship[s] receive an additional $20,000 bonus.

Clerkship bonuses have remained stagnant through the recession, but perhaps this move by Quinn Emanuel will be enough to move the market. After all, first-year associates at the vast majority of Biglaw firms are now making salaries of $180,000 — shouldn’t bonuses for elite judicial clerks be raised in turn? Federal clerks hope so.

Will any firms meet or beat Quinn Emanuel? Please feel free to let us know if your firm is paying a clerkship bonus in excess of $50,000 — or QE’s last high of $75,000 — for one clerkship. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Clerkship%20Bonuses) or text us (646-820-8477). Thanks!

# Firm Breaks Down Two-Class Biglaw System In Office Reopening Plan
## 'Staff are people too.' That's apparently something we need to say in Biglaw.

As Biglaw firms are[ plotting out their return to physical office plans](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/law-office-reopening-tracker-2021/), it’s clear they’re taking different paths. How many — if any — days will be required is a hot button issue, but so is the question of who gets to take advantage of flexibility. In determining their post-COVID plans, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan has decided to include their admin staff as beneficiaries of hybrid work.

In a Law.com [article](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/06/03/staff-are-people-too-all-stroock-employees-can-work-hybrid-including-secretaries/), Alan Klinger, firm co-managing partner made clear that breaking down “class barriers” between attorneys and staff was part of the rationale for the decision:

“Our admin side of the firm worked productively during the pandemic as well, so we aren’t taking it on blind faith,” Alan Klinger, co-managing partner and chair of government affairs and regulatory support, said of the decision to allow everyone to have some remote days. “We are doing this in part because we are trying to break down the class barriers that exist in many organizations, and we have come to believe that if we treat people professionally and fairly they will respond in kind.”

The other co-managing partner, Jeff Keitelman, echoed that sentiment:

“We wanted to do our best to solve for the problems that people have: child care, school schedules and the like. Staff are people too. We wanted everyone to have the benefit,” Keitelman said.

To make this work, the firm has paired up support staff so that one half of the duo can provide in-person coverage at all times:

“The nature of the work can be done in part remotely,” Klinger said. “We have secretaries working in pairs for larger numbers of people. We will make sure someone is physically in the office each day, and if something happens, like an illness, we expect the other side of the pair to cooperate.”

At Stroock they seem aware that this level of flexibility isn’t something [afforded staff](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/25/do-big-law-staff-have-to-return-to-the-office-it-depends/) at other firms, but they seem determined to make it work:

“We aren’t privy to the nuances of other firms, but we know what works at ours. We took the information we had, and we think it is going to work just fine,” Keitelman said.

So flexible work arrangement for all employees at Stroock — seems like a pretty good plan to me.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.
