# The Great (Law Firm) Resignation: Why You Shouldn’t Take A Counter-Offer (Part II)
## What should you do if your employer responds to your resignation announcement with a seemingly attractive offer to stay at your current firm?

This year, as the Great Resignation takes its toll on law firms, the volume of departures has been especially high. But for lawyers who haven’t been through it before, the process of resigning can be daunting. At Lateral Link, we routinely advise candidates on their resignation timing and process, so we think now is an opportune time to share that knowledge more broadly.

On Tuesday, in [Part I](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/the-great-law-firm-resignation-how-to-resign-part-i/) of this two-part series, we discussed how to resign properly, while managing the emotions that the resignation decision may trigger. Today, our topic is counter-offers and the promises that accompany them. What should you do if your employer responds to your resignation announcement with a seemingly attractive offer to stay at your current firm?

The logic of counter-offers

Employee turnover is expensive. Searching for a replacement and training the new hire to succeed in the role are both costly. In the interim, the firm may have to turn away work due to being short-staffed (or in most cases, push it on their current associates, causing severe burn out). Change is also risky: whereas a new employee has no easily observable track record, the employer knows the capabilities of its current staff.

These factors are doubly significant in a robust lateral market like the one we’re in now. Replacing you will not be easy, and it will probably take a long time. With that context, it’s no surprise that your employer would seek to talk you out of resigning. Pushback often comes in the form of questions like, “Can’t we persuade you to stay?” or “Can you think this over for a few days?”

The emotional appeal of a request to stay

Assuming you don’t hate your current job, an appeal to change your mind might cause you to think twice. We tend to view loyalty as an honorable quality, and it’s always nice to know that you’re wanted. Even on this dimension, however, it’s important to recognize that the consequences of declaring your intention to leave will linger. Once you announce your resignation, trust between you and your employer is broken. If you stay, your employer and co-workers may focus less on the sacrifice you’ve made in declining the new opportunity and more on the “lack of loyalty” you showed in submitting your resignation.

It’s also important to balance feeling flattered by the gesture of a counter-offer against the reality that it was only prompted by your threat to leave. If you were seen as such a valuable member of the team, why didn’t your employer proactively offer you better terms to remove the incentive to look elsewhere? If your employer is willing to offer a compensation increase or a promotion only after you announce your resignation, then the firm has been knowingly underpaying and undervaluing you, which demonstrates a clear lack of appreciation for your contributions.

Trust yourself

If you’ve thought the process through, chances are you would’ve already addressed your grievances with your current employer and for whatever reason, your employer failed to deliver. The fact that you decided to resign is a clear indication that you aren’t fully happy in your current role. True, a counter-offer could bring an attractive pay increase. But the work conditions that prompted your job search in the first place — poor partnership prospects, long hours, toxic culture, insufficient access to interesting work, and so forth — are unlikely to permanently change if you stay. You are an intelligent adult. You made your decision for a reason. The wisest course is to trust yourself.

Consider your future prospects

When you accept a counter-offer, it buys time for your employer to find your replacement. Sure, it’s possible the firm will let bygones be bygones and allow you to resume your prior career trajectory. But, with your loyalty now in question, it’s probable that your employer will look out for candidates to replace you and may terminate you once a suitable replacement is found. Even if your employer is not in a rush to get rid of you, the aborted resignation and residual doubt it creates are likely to factor in future promotion or lay-off decisions.

Don’t set yourself up for regret

Most employees who display momentary weakness and withdraw their resignation in the face of a counter-offer realize quickly that they have made a mistake. Promises made to keep them often turn out to be empty ones — a firm’s culture doesn’t change overnight. Worse, when a candidate realizes she should have followed through on her decision to leave, she may find that the firm she intended to join has filled its vacancies and moved on. Don’t let that happen to you.

A new year oftentimes means a new job for many people. If you need help navigating this “unprecedented” (yes, I said it) lateral hiring market, please feel free to contact me or any of my Lateral Link colleagues. In the meantime, here’s wishing that 2022 brings you new happiness, new goals, and new achievements. Cheers to the New Year!

# The Joy Of Removing Obstacles
## As an in-house lawyer, helping business leaders identify and remove obstacles that get in the way of business growth can be a source to tremendous satisfaction.

Over the course of my career, I have done many things. Of those things that I have done, I have enjoyed most being an in-house lawyer. What is it about being an in-house lawyer that I have enjoyed most? I have enjoyed helping business leaders identify and remove obstacles that get in the way of business growth. What have I learned when it comes to identifying and removing obstacles?

I have found that in-house lawyers who are most successful at identifying and removing obstacles:

- have the ability to become a subject matter expert quickly,
- have the ability to work independently,
- have the ability to make sense out of chaos, and
- have the ability to manage complex projects.

I have also found that in-house lawyers are most effective when they:

- understand the vision, mission, and goals of the organization;
- develop and nurture open lines of communication with people in the various units across the organization;
- learn what the people in various units across the organization do; and
- establish trust and rapport with those people in the various units across the organization.
Over the years, I have received plenty of really good advice about identifying and removing obstacles from those leaders with whom I have worked. As it turns out, many of my colleagues have heard some of the same things.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Deal with obstacles strategically. When dealing with an obstacle, I have been reminded of the importance of not dealing with an obstacle merely as an item to be crossed off a list. I have been reminded that it is important to deal with the problem strategically. The goal is not just to temporarily remove a obstacle from your view. The goal should be to identify the root issue causing the obstacle and to address it in a way that eliminates the obstacle from returning.

Understand that problems rarely get easier to solve with time. Problems do not get better with age. They only get worse with age. Addressing the problem when the problem first surfaces can be more efficient and better for everyone involved in the end.

Remember that not all problems are yours to solve. As a lawyer, I am wired to solve problems, but what I have come to understand is that not all problems are mine to solve. When a colleague comes to me with a problem, I have learned that it is often best to resist the urge to tell that colleague how to solve the problem. What have I learned to do instead? Listen. Your colleagues often have a pretty good sense of what they need to do. They just want someone who can serve as a sounding board for them. What your colleagues often really want is just for someone to listen as they talk through problems. They want and need someone they respect to help reassure them that there is nothing that they are missing and that their approach to their problem is sound.

As education lawyer Laura Anthony recently shared with me, “It is important to discern your role and find the right balance of listening and helping. When we automatically move to problem solving, we can miss an opportunity to connect and support others in finding their own solutions.”

Remember that sometimes slower is faster. While there is a time for action, there is also time for inaction. There are some problems that will resolve themselves in due time with a little patience.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Vice President and Deputy General Counsel JoAnna Nicholson recently shared with me some advice she once received on this very topic from Gary Steel, a digital marketing manager, that really resonated with me:

“‘Sometimes you need to let a little air get under [the problem].’ Not every problem should be solved immediately — some will solve themselves, and a knee-jerk reaction can actually make it worse.”

General Counsel and Board Member Marlene Eisenberg, took it a step further with this actionable advice: We all have a “pause button” we can use when approaching problems and challenges. There is a magical moment between what we hear and what we say that can make all the difference. By hitting that pause button, we give ourselves the time to assess and calibrate.

When identifying and removing obstacles, it is important to remember that no two obstacles are the same. What you did to overcome one obstacle will not necessarily work when you attempt to overcome another. As time passes, you will gain more and more experience. Your past decision-making experience will inform your future decision-making. This part of the in-house counsel is not one you will ever learn in law school. As Benjamin Franklin so aptly said, “Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”

# Non-Attorney -- Distinction Or Diss?
## A debate about language touches on the arrogance of our profession.

Stop the presses! A bunch of people on the internet passionately disagree about something! I know it’s hard to believe, but hear me out, because this time the debate raises important and provocative questions that go to the heart of the legal profession’s evolving identity.

It started with [a post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/juliesavarino_law-lawyer-inclusion-activity-6628283900420505600-u3zm/) by Julie Savarino that begins “Let’s all stop using ‘NON-LAWYER!’” I recommend taking a few minutes to read the post and the comments it spawned. The basic gist is that the term non-lawyer is “implicitly insulting and offensive” and ought to be stricken from our vocabularies.

As one might expect from a proposal to change the way other people speak, the discussion got heated. Many commenters enthusiastically agreed with Savarino, and they shared their own stories of times they felt derisively written off as a “non-lawyer” despite their substantial training, education, experience, and contributions. Others scoffed at her proposal as PC gobbledygook. “Non-lawyer,” they pointed out, is a facially neutral and descriptive term, and anyone offended by it needs to get over their own insecurities.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Within a week the post had been viewed over 73,000 times, with the likes and comments piling on top of one another. Clearly, Savarino struck a nerve with her followers. The post certainly made me think, as the phrase is relatively common in the industry. After reading Savarino’s proposal, I spent several days talking to my colleagues about it to get their perspectives.

A Necessary Distinction?

Most of the attorneys I spoke to tended to oppose Savarino’s idea — at least initially. Some of it, I think, comes from the impression that Savarino is trying to erase a legally, ethically, and factually important distinction. Governing ethics rules require lawyers to pay attention to the difference on a daily basis. Just this week, I had the opportunity to speak on a panel about whether [there’s a legal tech VC bubble](https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2020/02/04/the-biggest-hurdle-for-legal-tech-innovation-law-firms-business-structure/) at Legalweek in New York City, and the conversation migrated to state ethics rules that limit law firm ownership to licensed attorneys. In that instance, the distinction between lawyers and others was critical for discussing how and where venture capital can flow. Similarly, lawyers are duty-bound to think about the distinction to avoid the unauthorized practice of law.

Part of becoming a lawyer is being trained in the difference that being a licensed lawyer makes. It’s not surprising, then, that lawyers tend to view disallowing terms like “non-lawyer” as functionally difficult, and maybe altogether unworkable. So is the term nothing more than a necessary tool to ensure compliance with controlling ethics rules? Do people just need to get over it?

A Deep History Of Jerkiness

In sharp contrast to lawyers, the legal colleagues with whom I spoke who do not hold JDs almost universally despised the “non-lawyer” phrase. Several suggested it contributes to classism within the legal industry — diminishing their value and contributions. Others viewed it as simply another way lawyers can remind themselves and everyone else of their greatness.

Ego almost certainly plays a part in this discussion. As attorneys, we earn an “Esq.” after our names, and we rarely hesitate to show it off. Being a lawyer makes us feel important in a way we otherwise wouldn’t be. We’re a proud, frankly arrogant, profession that has historically enjoyed a lot of social and professional privileges. And to the privileged, calls for equal treatment of others can sometimes feel like calls for oppression.

The most powerful comments on Savarino’s posts I read were the stories from legal personnel of the outright disrespect the attorneys with whom they work showed for them. Some commenters recalled being divided not just into attorneys and non-attorneys, but also “fee earners” and “non-fee earners,” or even worse, “fee burners.” There’s nothing implicit about that distinction; it flatly characterizes non-attorneys as either adding nothing to the firm’s bottom line, or actively dragging it down.

I’ll add my own story to the pile. I unfortunately once heard an attorney refer to a firm staff member simply as “the overhead.” That’s right, a hard-working human being was referred to the same way we might refer to pens, staplers, or a copy machine. Hopefully most of my fellow attorneys would be aghast to hear a colleague speak like that, but there are sadly probably more than a few in our industry that might nod their heads in approval.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The culture of law is based on a deeply hierarchical, nearly feudal social structure. Lawyers sit at the top, whether they have 30 years of experience or just passed their bar, and everyone else is down somewhere below. That’s how it’s been within the living memory of the profession. When a system has been around that long, it’s easy to internalize it and assume that’s how things always have to be. It’s especially easy to internalize a system when you’re at the top of it.

Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité

It doesn’t have to be this way, and it shouldn’t. Sorry lawyers, like it or not, without the many allied legal professionals with whom you work, you wouldn’t have a job or drive that fancy Mercedes. What’s more, every day, creative “non-lawyer” founders are launching and building legal businesses, and many of our clients are lining up saying they prefer their legal work to ours.

I might be a partner today, but my first job at my firm was as a file clerk. The work I did then contributed to my firm’s success, just the same as the work I do today.

I’m proud of the strides my firm has made toward a more egalitarian structure. The firm used to hold separate holiday parties, one for attorneys, one for staff. We’ve combined them into one. When one of our offices recently relocated, we did away with separate attorney and staff lounges and built one place for everyone to relax in, regardless of job title. Across the industry, there’s been expected resistance to changes like these from some attorneys. I’ve also heard stories of vocal resistance from staff members who prefer not having to deal with attorneys on their downtime. But we’re all on one team, and I don’t think any of us should tolerate a system that creates second-class citizens. Regardless of education, licensure, experience, or history, everyone in a law firm is contributing to serving clients.

While the internet debate about the viability of Savarino’s specific proposal rages on, the emotional heart of her idea is inarguably true. As a profession, we have a long way to go to root out our arrogance and to better value and respect the professionals that allow us to serve clients. Sometimes identifying that someone is not an attorney is appropriate and essential. Plenty of other times, it’s just some narcissistic lawyer being a jerk.

Stop, Think, Act

There’s a sign on a door at grade school my children attend. It says, “Stop, Think, Act.” The advice may be intended for preschoolers, but it applies equally to lawyers. This debate is about much more than just a hot-button phrase; it’s about a defining characteristic of the industry. So, whatever words we use, let’s consider what we’re saying, why we’re saying it, and how we say it.

If the toddlers are expected to do it, so should we.

# Biglaw Firm Does Away With Its Coronavirus Crisis Compensation Cuts

Another day, another Biglaw firm that’s decided to do away with its COVID-19 austerity measures. This time, a firm that earlier admitted that it perhaps overreacted to the coronavirus crisis is making a move. Which one could it be?

It’s Loeb & Loeb. Back in April, the firm [announced some salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/biglaw-firm-announces-up-to-20-percent-pay-cuts-to-avoid-layoffs/) as a way to avoid layoffs. Partners took the hardest hit, with draws slashed by 20 percent. Income partners, senior counsel, of counsel, associates, and senior staff had their salaries cut by 15 percent and paralegals and other staff saw 10 percent cuts. Then, effective September 1, the firm [partially rolled back](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/another-biglaw-firm-admits-it-overreacted-to-covid-19-will-partially-walk-back-salary-cuts/) those compensation cuts by 60 percent for income partners, senior counsel, of counsel, associates, paralegals, and staff, while the reductions for monthly capital partner draws remained in place. Now, all of that is changing.

As reported by [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/reed-smith-loeb-loeb-move-to-fully-reverse-pandemic-pay-cuts), the firm will be completely eliminating its salary cuts. Chair Kenneth Florin announced via email that Loeb & Loeb “continues to outperform our initial financial projections for the pandemic,” so all compensation cuts will be eliminated and partner draws restored, retroactive to October 1.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm on the exciting news.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# In Defense Of More Sizzle, Less Steak

I’ll say it: efficiency and value are overrated. I’ve argued long and hard in this space that law firms in today’s market need to get creative and aggressive about cutting overhead, getting lean and mean, and delivering value in new ways to clients. I retract nothing, but I do feel compelled to add some caveats after reading two recent articles about continuing trends that I’ve been documenting in this column over the past months.

The first article is [an excellent breakdown](https://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/despite-anxiety-inducing-trends-am-law-100-rose-to-the-challenge-in-2017/) by Roy Strom of the recently released figures on growth and revenues in the Am Law 100 firms. The overall picture was strong, at least by modern standards. Revenues are up 5.5 percent, net income to the partnership level is up even more at 6.1 percent, and other leading indicators of the overall health of the industry are positive.

There are a couple of spots for worry, however. First, these numbers still haven’t caught up with the figures that law firms were pulling down prior to the Great Recession. Given that we’ve been in a strong economy for the past few years, including recent record-breaking numbers in the stock market, every year that law firm production continues to remain stagnant is another nail in the coffin of the Golden Era of Biglaw. There’s still plenty of money to be made, but the fact remains that the legal market just ain’t what it used to be.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)

We’re also continuing to see the ultra-rich firms at the top of the market experiencing growth and revenues that outpace the rest of the pack. Firms like Latham and Kirkland are doing record business, pulling in over $3 billion in revenue each last year, and are seeing growth percentages well above the rest of the Am Law 100. The farther down the list you go, the less growth you see.

The realities of this new normal were hammered home a few days later by [Hanna Barczyk](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/the-super-rich-are-getting-richer/), whose linked article has lingered in my mind since I read it. We’ve known for a while that, in law as in life, [the rich tend to get richer](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/amazon-etsy-and-biglaw/). Those with the most wealth attract the best talent, who tend in turn to attract more wealth. Firms positioned at the top of the market are going to bring in the highest quality work, be able to poach the best attorneys from their rivals, outspend and outmaneuver the competition, and generally leverage their existing advantages into even bigger advantages.

What Barczyk highlights is that the super-rich firms at the top of the market have put themselves in a class of their own. Latham, Kirkland, and their peers may be law firms, but they aren’t really in competition with the rest of the legal market. Their only competition is each other. When multibillion-dollar transactions come around, or publicly traded entities end up in bet-the-company litigation, where money is truly no object, that short list of firms will always get the call. No one’s staring down due diligence on a $600M acquisition and wondering whether to go with the firm that’s $25/hour cheaper. The competition is instead based on who’s got the experience, who’s got the relationships, who’s going to succeed where failure is not an option. Their reputations and experience are such that price competition isn’t really something they need to think about. As a result, their profit margins remain, to use a technical term, ginormous.

The rest of the legal industry is running a fundamentally different race. We’re increasingly competing not on prestige or name recognition, but on value. The legal market below the absolute top tier is focusing intently on efficiency to survive an increasingly competitive market. Law firms are cutting their rates and commoditizing work, [sometimes to a fatal degree](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/sedgwick-death-by-billable-hours/). We’re looking to technology and [going virtual](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/the-most-important-law-firm-youve-never-heard-of/) in an attempt to cut overhead and maximize profitability. We’re getting scrappy and creative to survive in a market that’s under siege by alternative legal providers, [the Big Four accounting firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/king-kong-is-coming-to-crush-your-practice-with-a-calculator/), and our clients’ incentives to pull work in-house. In short, most of us are competing in a value-based market where someone’s almost always going to find a way to do what we’re doing cheaper. I’m exhausted just typing that sentence out.

I’ve long been [banging the drum](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/saving-biglaw/) of efficiency, creativity, and a client-centric mindset that focuses on value. But I’ve also long held that there’s a benefit in zigging where everyone else is zagging. If the vast majority of the market is going all-in on increasing client value as its strategy, doesn’t it make sense to hedge against that trend?

My father is an attorney, and before moving to an in-house gig, he spent a short time as a solo practitioner. When he hung out his shingle, he was charging $50/hour, well below the going market rate, and yet had few clients. He went to a mentor, and received some great advice: double your rate. At $50/hour, potential clients were wondering why they were getting such a steal, and wondering if the quality of representation matched the fee they were paying. At $100/hour, potential clients presumed they were getting quality to match the bill. The clients started pouring in and his practice went on the upswing.

As attorneys, we absolutely need to be competing on value. The market is more competitive than it’s ever been. Compared to 10 years ago, more attorneys are out there fighting over a smaller pie, and now non-attorneys are getting into the fight more than ever. But value can’t be the only answer to this problem. The drive for low-rate, commoditized work has killed more than one firm. Cutting rates can be a savvy move, but it also decreases the perception of a firm’s value.

Law firms that want to remain relevant would be well-served by not just increasing the value they provide to their clients, but also by maintaining their old-school cachet. That’s a market advantage that no online document repository or accounting firm can match. Even the best steak needs some sizzle.

Back in the day, there was one firm that could easily be relied upon to sweeten the year’s bonus pool with the addition of special bonuses. That title now belongs to Davis Polk, but it used to be Sullivan & Cromwell that wore the crown.

After bringing home $1,555,441,000 gross revenue in 2020, the firm came in 18th place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. S&C has now spoken out on bonuses, and according to sources, it seems to be following the market (with no additional compensation for high billers, which has some associates miffed).

# Leader In Biglaw Parental Leave Further Expands Its Already Unprecedented Benefits
## This firm is making it possible for attorneys to practice law while balancing their family lives.

Father’s Day was yesterday, and one law firm decided to mark the occasion by expanding its celebrated parental leave policy, which has long been hailed as one of the best parental leave policies in all of Biglaw.

[Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/orrick-herrington-sutcliffe/), the law firm that in 2015 began offering the unprecedented benefits of [22 weeks of primary caregiver leave](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/which-biglaw-firm-has-the-best-parental-leave-policy/) to U.S. attorneys with the option of taking up to nine months of total leave before returning to work full-time, is increasing its non-primary caregiver leave benefits for both attorneys and staff members. Lawyers at the firm in non-primary caregiver roles will now be able to take six weeks of paid leave, while staff will be able to take three weeks of paid leave. The firm is also adjusting its onramping program for both primary and non-primary caregivers who are returning from leave with the introduction of the “Guardrails” program. Here’s more information from the firm’s press release:

The first weeks after returning from leave are an adjustment period – and long, unpredictable work hours can be overwhelming. Through onramping, Orrick already provides a 50% workload expectation during the first month back from primary caregiver leave (which lawyers may choose to extend through the firm’s Flexible Work Arrangement program). Through Guardrails, the firm is adding the important element of predictability. Guardrails give new parents the option of working predictable hours up to a maximum of six hours daily during the first month after returning from primary caregiver leave and the first two weeks after non-primary caregiver leave.

Last, but certainly not least, Orrick will be making a $250 contribution to a 529 college fund for all new babies of lawyers and staff at the firm.

Because Orrick’s parental leave policy is completely gender-neutral, attorneys and staff at the firm have been able to take advantage of both primary and non-primary caregiver leave as their roles change within their families. There are 22 total weeks of leave time available, and one type of leave offsets the other.

Orrick’s chief talent officer [Siobhan Handley](https://www.orrick.com/People/A/9/1/Siobhan-Handley), who also serves as the firm’s parental leave liaison, said that the firm chose to prioritize greater predictability of work hours for new parents and support for non-primary caregivers who are interested in equally sharing parenting responsibilities as a way to further innovate parental leave at major law firms. “I want our attorneys and staff to feel supported, and that Orrick is invested in them in the long haul,” she said. “The best talent want to be the best parents and we need to have policies that support that, because they’re overachievers in every way, including parenting.”

Firm leaders at Orrick are fully invested in the parental leave program, which has been so successful that there has been an uptick in the number of people who have chosen to take advantage of its generous offerings. Last year, 33 associates — including five men — took primary caregiver leave. According to Handley, up to nine men may take primary caregiver leave this year. “Orrick is the best place to work for parents, and we really put our policies where our mouth is,” she said. [Mitch Zuklie](https://www.orrick.com/People/8/5/E/Mitchell-Zuklie), Orrick’s chairman, noted that “[t]hese programs are focused on retaining, advancing, and, hopefully, inspiring the best rising talent at our firm. … [W]e believe this makes a meaningful difference in our ability to field teams of unique quality, continuity, and diversity.”

Senior associate [Shaila Rahman Diwan](https://www.orrick.com/People/0/A/7/Shaila-Rahman-Diwan), a litigator in Orrick’s New York office, will be taking her second parental leave in a few weeks. While she was able to take advantage of the firm’s generous leave policy during her last pregnancy, she thinks that the updated policies will be more helpful to her with this pregnancy. “I think my next onramping period will be even smoother and easier to navigate with the new ‘Onramping Guardrails’ policy,” Diwan said. “It makes it possible for associates to set maximum daily hours during their first month back from leave. This provides us with more predictability in our schedules, which is always valuable, but even more so in the first month back from parental leave.”

“My impression is that Orrick is really trying to come up with new ways to help parents and I believe these efforts are making a huge impact, particularly in helping primary caregivers continue to practice law at an amazing firm while balancing their family lives,” Diwan said.

[Aaron Scherzer](https://www.orrick.com/People/2/0/D/Aaron-Scherzer?lang=en), a senior associate in Orrick’s Supreme Court and appellate litigation group in New York, is a father of twins who were born 18 months ago. He took four weeks of secondary caregiver leave his children were born, and 12 weeks of primary caregiver leave when his wife returned to work. “This leave policy was critically important to my wife and me as we started our family. The bonding that I did with my sons during my leave is irreplaceable. I’ve seen how quickly they grow up, and I cherish the photos of the time we spent together while I was on leave,” he said. “The primary caregiver leave also helped to shape me as a father. Today, I am a much more active participant in thinking through what our boys will do each day and the million other little decisions that go into their daily lives than I might otherwise have been.”

Scherzer elaborated that when he was on leave, whether it was as a primary or non-primary caregiver, the firm respected it, in that he wasn’t treated like he was working from home full-time: “I was only contacted on cases when it was truly necessary, and when I was, everyone always gave me plenty of time to respond (which was good because I certainly had my hands full taking care of our twins).”

“Orrick’s generous parental leave policy and the commitment that the leadership of the firm and my practice group showed to that policy was one of the primary reasons I chose Orrick,”
Scherzer said.

Congratulations once again to Orrick for being a firm that’s taking its commitment to furthering women’s advancement in the legal profession seriously, and for being a firm that realizes men shouldn’t be discouraged from taking part in their children’s lives. We’d wish Orrick the best of luck in becoming one of the best law firms to work for, but we’re not sure that the firm needs it — Orrick seems to be doing an absolutely fantastic job already.

# Biglaw Firms Brace For Possible Recession
## Are these firms prepared for the financial doom and gloom that's lurking on the horizon?

For those working in Biglaw, there was nothing “great” about the Great Recession. Thousands of associates were laid off, incoming associates had their employment deferred, and law students had their offers pulled. It ultimately took Biglaw years to recover, and it was far from a painless endeavor. And let us not forget the recession caused by the 2020 coronavirus crisis, when Biglaw firms managed their expenses by using the cost-cutting measures of salary cuts, furloughs, staff layoffs, and stealth associate layoffs. That was no picnic either.

But what will happen when the next recession arrives? Are these firms prepared to face what may lie ahead?

Right now, Biglaw firms are riding high on a post-pandemic wave of unprecedented financial success and associates are raking in the big bucks in terms of increased salaries and bonuses. Things seem to be going really well, but darkness is looming on the horizon, with economists forecasting bad times in the future. How are law firms gearing up for the possible economic dip? The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/05/31/is-big-law-ready-for-a-recession/) has the details:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In the event of a downturn, law firm leaders and industry observers said, they are expecting the rate of office openings and the competition for talent to slow, while putting more focus on counter-cyclical practice areas. Those dynamics could also put pressure on billing rates and shift some of the leverage away from employees and back to law firm management for issues such as compensation and whether personnel can work remotely, industry observers added.

Already, the battle for top talent has slowed a bit, as law firms are offering fewer big signing bonuses compared with last year, and firms are showing less appetite for hiring droves of associates at once, recruiters say.

So, which practice areas should get ready for the spotlight? Bill Josten, strategic content manager for Thomson Reuters who oversees the Law Firm Financial Index, has the scoop:

Litigation, in general, is often considered a countercyclical practice, and demand in that area is almost back up to where it was in 2019 during its “high-water mark,” he added. Insurance work is also generally considered evergreen. And in addition to bankruptcy, some other areas might be ripe for growth during a downturn.

“Real estate practices have been going strong. Tax practices have been showing back-and-forth signs, but with taxes, there is a potential upside. Regulatory and compliance has the potential for a lot of expansion, particularly globally,” Josten said. “So there are areas where firms could potentially focus.”

While some Biglaw leaders are trying to put their eggs in one basket to prepare for the worst, others are a little more optimistic when it comes to the economy. Take, for example, John Quinn of Quinn Emanuel, who recently told Am Law that he thinks “the good times are still rolling.” In fact, he said, “I think law firms are still super busy and looking to recruit.”

No matter where the leader of your Biglaw firm stands — whether they’re wearing rose-colored glasses or preparing for economic doom and gloom — they seem better prepared to face financial woes than ever before thanks to what they learned during the recessions of the past. Hopefully that means layoffs of all kinds will be kept to a minimum if a recession actually occurs, but if things start getting bad, you know where to reach us.

Willkie Farr & Gallagher (photo by David Lat).

My time working for Above the Law has taught me that anytime a Biglaw partner gets in trouble with the law, there is a lot of interest in the industry. Given the nature of the allegations against Willkie Farr Co-Chair Gordon Caplan in the college admissions scandal, which combine elitism, wealth, and power — plus the connections to Hollywood actresses — the appetite for information about the case has been voracious. But other than the indictment, there’s been little else to report. The fact Caplan was been [charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud in connection with the college admissions scandal](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/willkie-farr-chair-caught-in-college-admissions-scandal/) has been shocking, and the Biglaw firm where he worked has been pretty quiet about the matter.

Until now. Willkie Farr has released a statement about the fate of Caplan — at least as it relates to his future at the firm. The firm has decided to place Caplan on a leave of absence and take away all responsibilities for the management of the firm:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As widely reported, one of our partners, Gordon Caplan, was among the persons charged in the college admissions matter. This is a personal matter and does not involve Willkie or any of its clients. In light of the seriousness of the matter, Mr. Caplan has been placed on a leave of absence from the Firm and will have no further Firm management responsibilities. The Firm will continue to be managed by its Chairmen, Steven Gartner and Thomas Cerabino, and its Executive Committee. Our focus remains on our responsibilities to our clients, partners and employees.

That’s likely all the firm will say on the matter — at least until the wheels of justice churn a little further in Caplan’s case.

# Record-High Demand For Environmental Attorneys
## Growing recognition of a business imperative for ESG has sharply increased demand for environmental attorneys.

The increasing concerns about climate change and the rising prominence of broader Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors have become dominant themes in business. Around the world, both private markets and governments are intensely focused on sustainability. Blackrock CEO Larry Fink captured the mood in his 2022 Annual Letter to CEOs, [predicting](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter): “The next 1,000 unicorns won’t be search engines or social media companies, they’ll be sustainable, scalable innovators – startups that help the world decarbonize and make the energy transition affordable for all consumers.”

Growing recognition of a business imperative for ESG has sharply increased demand for environmental attorneys. ESG has been a part of the corporate landscape for years, but until recently, environmental and social issues were largely limited to law firm specialty practices, such as environmental groups. In contrast, today we see a broadening of ESG-related legal matters across numerous practice areas including M&A, litigation, and regulatory.

A “whole of government” approach

With President Biden regularly emphasizing the importance of climate and ESG issues, federal agencies are taking a “whole of government” approach. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) established a Climate and ESG Task Force in March 2021, which has focused both on issuers’ disclosures about ESG and climate matters and on compliance programs for registered investment advisers marketing ESG funds. The SEC is considering new rulemaking in this area, with the aim of ensuring consistency and comparability in public company disclosures and facilitating investment managers’ ability to evaluate potential ESG investments. Speaking in July 2021, SEC Chair Gary Gensler [advocated the benefits](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-pri-2021-07-28) of corporate disclosure of climate-related risks and stated that he had directed SEC staff to develop a mandatory climate risk disclosure rule proposal.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established an interagency task force on hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), [noting](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-enforcement-and-compliance-accomplishments-fiscal-year-2021) that “global phasedown of HFCs is expected to avoid up to 0.5 °C of global warming by 2100.” The taskforce seeks to combat the illegal trade, production, use or sale of HFCs, and is taking measures to support the transition to HFC alternatives, reclamation, and recycling. The Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Department of Justice has sought to address climate change in part by bringing Clean Air Act cases related to the use of flares to burn off volatile organic compounds, toxics and other pollutants in waste gases.

Growing public demand and awareness

Though the regulatory developments are of central interest to attorneys, it is also important to note the rising support for ESG principles among the broader public. This is reflected in extraordinary growth of investor interest in ESG-focused products. Morningstar data shows that in the first three quarters of 2021, over $54 billion flowed into ESG funds, eclipsing the total for all of 2020. The 2020 flow of $51 billion was itself a record, more than doubling the total flow in 2019. Environmental justice topics are increasingly the subject of media attention, helping to drive greater public awareness. Corporations must be cognizant of this broader trend in the public mood as they formulate their business strategies and anticipate potential risks.

Ideal conditions for environmental attorneys

Now, more than ever, clients and law firms need environmental attorneys who can navigate an expanding and fast-changing maze of environmental laws. The eruption of client demand has created a surge of new positions for environmental attorneys at all levels, from junior environmental associates to senior environmental partners. Firms and clients are seeking lawyers who understand the Clean Air Act, in particular, but can also advise on a wide array of Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance issues.

In the current market, environmental attorneys are uniquely positioned to take their practices to the next level. With more environmental matters to pitch to clients than ever before, the opportunities to expand are everywhere. Robust demand for environmental attorneys is enabling lawyers with experience in this field to make impressive lateral moves, either to more prestigious firms or to higher-ranked environmental practices.

# Debevoise And Cleary Consider Massive Character-Altering Changes
## Lockstep partnership comp is in decline but some elite firms are holding the line.

When Cleary fired a group of partners earlier this year [while they prepared to bolt for Freshfields](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/major-lateral-moves-its-open-season-on-cleary-partners/), folks started wondering if the era of lockstep partner compensation may have finally come to an end. The true traditionalists out there — including Cleary, Debevoise, and Cravath — continue to adhere to a partner pay model that hands out firm profits based on seniority rather than an individualized assessment of the partner’s value to the firm. It’s a window back to a more collegial time in the profession’s history.

Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/12/23/debevoise-sticks-with-lockstep-partner-pay-after-compensation-review/) that Debevoise just completed a comprehensive review of its comp before deciding — despite the slings and arrows of modern law firm competition — to stay the course. Moreover, the firm’s partnership agreed unanimously not to make any changes.

[Presiding partner Michael] Blair said he believes lockstep is the best system to attract and retain the best talent. “We think it’s a competitive advantage, and our clients tell us it’s a competitive advantage,” he said. “Our lockstep system frees us from any misaligned financial incentives that could get in the way of delivering to clients the best teams for the project.”

That competitive advantage manifests itself in allowing the firm to offer one-stop shopping to clients, willing to provide services that generate less revenue to address the needs of clients bringing in big money for other practice groups. It allows the firm to avoid a Balkanization of the workforce with associates held in inefficient fiefdoms unable to flow to their best use because of rainmaker demands. And Debevoise has turned those advantages into record profits.

A Law.com source said Cleary had explored a comp change as well, but the firm was more tight-lipped about it that Debevoise — likely because such a review could be cast as reactive given the high-profile firings this year. But it’s more than likely that Cleary sticks with its peer group and holds the line on compensation, if only because bailing now would make the whole Freshfields affair for naught. The extreme move of firing a group of departing partners was a principled stance in defense of a way of life — or at least a way of practice — that’s taking hits across the profession. Don’t give in now.

Lockstep may not be a viable option for everyone, but for the sliver of firms with the wherewithal to make it work, there’s no need to join the nouveau riche.

# What You Need To Know About 'Respectful' Law Firm Succession Planning

Last year, the ABA issued a report called, [“The Path to Lawyer Well-Being: Practical Recommendations For Positive Change.”](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/abanews/ThePathToLawyerWellBeingReportFINAL.pdf) Did you know that the ABA had a task force on this topic?  Did you know that this report exists? I didn’t, but I think we can all agree that lawyer well-being is a worthwhile goal, perhaps not attainable, but worth pursuing.

The report contains a lot of information we already know and actions that we should have been taking for years. Just one such example: “foster collegiality and respective engagement throughout the profession” by promoting diversity and inclusion, creating meaningful mentoring, and sponsorship programs. (Do I hear gagging?) Acknowledging that the amount of recommendations can be seen as overwhelming, nonetheless, the report styles itself as a call to action, seeing the legal profession at a crossroads. Duh.

The part of the report that grabbed my attention was “Guide and Support the Transition of Older Lawyers.” Hmm… that would be us dinosaurs. In other words, let’s talk about succession planning, a phrase that strikes terror in the hearts of boomer lawyers, while millennial lawyers are more than ready to drive stakes through the hearts of boomer lawyers, ready to [“throw momma from the train.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3hgQnA_pGU)   (If you’ve never seen the movie, stream it. It’s hilarious.)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The report estimates that, in law firms, nearly 65 percent of equity partners will retire over the next decade. Millennials are not just waiting in the wings any longer; they are ready to pounce upon whatever opportunities are there for the picking.

While the report says that “senior lawyers can bring much to the table,” “at the same time, however, aging lawyers have an increasing risk for declining physical and mental capacity.” The report correctly notes that “few lawyers and legal organizations have sufficiently prepared to manage transitions away from the practice of law before a crisis occurs.” As a result, the report contends, there is “a rise in regulatory and other issues relating to the impairment of senior lawyers.”  So, as we dinosaurs become aged, infirm, subject to discipline, and apparently non compos mentis to a greater or lesser degree, the report suggests how to plan for the transition of older lawyers:

1. “Provide education to detect cognitive decline.” I do not know any lawyer who is also a psychologist, psychiatrist, neuropsychiatrist, or geriatrician trained to “detect cognitive decline.” And, by the way, how is “cognitive decline” defined? What are characteristics of cognitive decline? Whose standards are to be used? Is there a baseline determination? What type of education should be provided?

What may be one firm’s definition of cognitive decline (“Time to give Irving the heave-ho.”) may not be another’s (“Sue is still one of the best rainmakers we have and her clients love her.”). Who makes that decision? Should there be a universal standard for determining that?  Missing a lunch date (haven’t we all done that?) is definitely different than blowing a statute of limitations. And even then, that doesn’t necessarily indicate cognitive decline. It may be a very bad case of “whoops.”  Call the carrier, but not for a straitjacket.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

So, here’s my question: are we all going to become hapless Inspector Clouseaus trying to determine whether a colleague is in “cognitive decline?”

2. The report’s second recommendation is “develop succession plans.” Obvious, isn’t it? But how many law firms, solo practitioners, and corporate law departments are actually doing that? My sense is not that many.

Succession plans can take one of several forms: “work until you drop,” “I’m not introducing you to my clients because they’re my clients and my billables,” or some other reason. It’s hard to let go, and lawyers are not different than anyone else.

Why let go until it’s absolutely necessary, e.g., lawyer strokes out at the desk? Then what happens? All that knowledge, all that wealth of experience, all those contacts may be difficult to retrieve, and the client thinks, “What now?” That’s why it’s critical to have a succession plan in place, to introduce the successors to the clients, to show that transition will be seamless, and there is no reason for the client to fret.

That won’t happen if there’s no succession plan in place, and lawyers at other firms (as well as lawyers within the firm) may see this gap as the perfect opportunity to swoop down and pluck off those very valuable and lucrative clients. Please don’t tell me that’s never happened.

3. The third suggestion is “create transition programs to respectfully aid retiring professionals plan for their next chapter.” Yes, we’re old. We don’t need to be told that. Yes, we have fewer years ahead of us than behind us. We know that, too. What exactly IS our “next chapter”? Couldn’t that be different for each one of us?

The key word in that suggestion is the adverb “respectfully.” It’s never easy to have difficult conversations. It’s hard when it’s a colleague, and even harder when it’s a colleague who is also a friend and you have spent many years together in practice.

In 2014, the New Mexico Supreme Court put together a [succession planning handbook](https://www.nmbar.org/NmbarDocs/forMembers/Succession/SuccessionHandbook.pdf) for the state’s lawyers.  It has checklists and sample forms and provides a framework for customizing a plan, regardless of your jurisdiction.

The handbook details several horror stories about what happens when there’s a lack of succession planning, not just for retirement, but for disability and death. If you don’t read anything else in this handbook, read those stories and make a plan. Don’t keep it a secret, whatever the size of your firm, be it solo, small firm, Biglaw, or any size in between.

The reasons for transition aside, no dinosaur lawyer — in fact, no lawyer, at whatever career stage — wants to be treated as having a “sell by date.” So, respectfully guide and support the transition of older lawyers. We dinosaurs may even thank you for it.

She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Done With Biglaw? Why NOW Is The Time To Consider A Smaller Firm
## Smaller regional firms and boutiques are becoming an attractive option for associates seeking better job security, a wider range of practice areas, and a more sustainable work-life balance in the current market.

Talking to associates about career options is my favorite aspect of my job as a recruiter. Having worked on the recruitment teams at both a boutique and one of the world’s biggest law firms, I have a nuanced perspective on the pros and cons of each. The bottom line is that there is no “one size fits all” solution: many attorneys thrive at their Biglaw practices, but others prefer a different path.

Most Biglaw associates I speak with view a move in-house as the only true exit option. They often perceive in-house roles to offer a perfect convergence of lifestyle, work, and benefits. That might be true in some companies, but associates who make the in-house transition often discover that their expectations were unrealistic, as my colleague Adrienne Levi has [discussed in detail](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/burned-out-in-biglaw-dont-jump-in-house-without-also-considering-boutiques/). 

Of course, recent layoffs at both major law firms and large companies are on the minds of many associates. It may feel like there is no safe next step. But it’s important to recognize that Biglaw and in-house roles are not the only possibilities. For an associate looking to make a move in the current market, a smaller regional firm or boutique may be a more compelling option than ever. Let’s take a look at what these firms can offer and why now is the time to consider a lateral move to one.

Job security 

Smaller firms are not immune to market forces, but they are in a different position from the many Biglaw firms that participated in the hiring frenzy of the past few years. By and large, smaller firms sat on the sidelines, hiring conservatively on an “as needed” basis. So at a time when many Biglaw firms and in-house legal departments have “dead weight” to shed, smaller firms are better positioned to avoid layoffs.

Breadth of experience

Smaller firms and boutiques are often full service counsel to their clients, despite having far fewer attorneys. This enables corporate associates to work across a variety of practices, including more niche areas like real estate, employment and corporate governance. That opportunity contrasts starkly with the typical Biglaw experience of specialization into a single area such as M&A or finance.

Associates who switch to a smaller firm often find the variety refreshing. But it also has a more tactical advantage: the opportunity to pivot your practice will serve you well in a slower economy when certain transactional practices can grind to a halt, putting your job at risk.

Superior lifestyle/compensation balance

As Adrienne [points out](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/burned-out-in-biglaw-dont-jump-in-house-without-also-considering-boutiques/), there will likely be a compensation trade-off when making a move to a smaller firm or a boutique, assuming you are currently on the Biglaw market scale. But if you choose wisely, any compensation hit can be more than balanced by a reduced workload.

For example, I work regularly with a San Francisco-based boutique that pays around 15-20% below the typical Biglaw scale. However, this firm requires just 1800 hours annually, whereas the average Biglaw corporate associate bills about 2500 per year. So the 15-20% pay cut comes with an hours reduction of around 30%. For many associates, that is an attractive trade. Even from a wealth maximization perspective, it can be a smart move to shift to a workload that makes a longer private practice career feel like a viable option. Imagine what you could do with an extra 700 hours a year!

They’re hiring!

I’ve spoken with several regional and boutique firms who view this downturn as an opportunity. Because they can be more nimble with their fees, they expect to attract potentially distressed clients, and they anticipate needing more talent to support a growing pipeline of matters. Many of these firms have no qualms about hiring associates who were laid off: Biglaw training is valuable, and these firms recognize their opportunity to capitalize on the newly available talent pool in a less competitive hiring environment.

In summary, while I could also write a lengthy article on the benefits of sticking it out at a big firm (training, cutting-edge legal work, not to mention comp…), I think it’s important to recognize that staying in Biglaw is not the best path for everyone. For those ready to move on, there are wonderfully fulfilling law firm opportunities out there.

The Biglaw bonus announcements are coming in fast and furious! The matching of the established bonus scale is an annual tradition, and in a year with talent wars a-brewin’, it is supercharged.

The latest firm eager to express their appreciation to associates through generous dollar amounts is White & Case. Last year, the firm made $2,387,800,000 in gross revenue, making it number 8 on the Am Law 100, and these bonus number sure look elite.

Look: It’s odd the second gentleman is their teacher. But we kind of dispensed with that … maybe five minutes in the first class. Now, it’s just they want to learn, they want to be great lawyers and I’m trying to impart to them experiences as a lawyer.

— [Doug Emhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Emhoff), commenting earlier this month on [his new roles](https://people.com/politics/doug-emhoff-on-what-hes-learned-in-new-teaching-role/) as a professor at Georgetown Law and the first Second Gentleman of the United States. Emhoff is teaching “Entertainment Law Disputes,” a two-credit course. Emhoff, a former partner at DLA Piper, said of his former Biglaw career, “I do miss it. I did it for 30 years, I thought I was good at it and successful, but what an opportunity, if I’m gonna leave to be able to be in this administration, and also to support my wife. I mean, she’s the first female vice president. I’m so proud of her.”

## Biglaw firms are saying 'thank you' in the best way they know how -- with money.

The spring of Biglaw special bonuses continues. This March is not going out like a lamb when it comes to the bonus dollars that are flowing throughout the largest law firms in America.

Willkie got the [special bonus ball rolling](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/), but Davis Polk came out on top as the firm is wont to do, and [wowed the market with more money](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) — and others have matched that more generous scale, in droves.

Attorneys received a much-appreciated announcement today from the powers-that-be at Paul Hastings, a firm that brought in $1,268,910,000 gross revenue in 2019. The firm announced it would be joining Biglaw’s best in giving out special bonuses. Payable on May 28 and October 29, the firm will give out between $12,000 and $64,000, depending on class year, according to the following schedule in its U.S., Asia, London, Frankfurt, and São Paulo offices (full memo on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/paul-hastings-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

Echoing its peers, the firm noted that these special bonuses will not impact its year-end bonuses. Congratulations to everyone at Paul Hastings!

# The Wolf Of Biglaw
## Kirkland & Ellis has reshaped the legal industry -- for better or worse.

If you’re looking for a high-powered, take-no-prisoners law firm straight out of central casting, they don’t come bigger or badder than Kirkland & Ellis. The firm unquestionably enjoys a reputation for top-flight lawyering where businesses go when everything is on the line. The firm also sits atop the Am Law 100 rankings based on gross revenue. But amassing more money than any other U.S. law firm in an industry built on human beings billing hours doesn’t come without some baggage.

For those who somehow don’t know, Kirkland & Ellis made its modern reputation as the OG, eat-what-you-kill megafirm. Whereas Biglaw firms through the 20th century had adopted lockstep compensation among its associates and partners to encourage team-first thinking and staffing, K&E recognized that this system was leaving young rainmaking superstars feeling undercompensated compared to the value they were bringing in. Kirkland started the trend of luring high performers away with gargantuan salaries based on collected dollars, one that the rest of the industry has largely now adopted. And with partners reportedly pulling in eight-figures, it has no doubt been lucrative.

But all that cash doesn’t come from thin air. As a [recent  Bloomberg Law article highlights](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/the-worlds-largest-law-firm-thinks-youve-got-it-all-wrong), Kirkland has long had a reputation for brutally long hours, unforgiving deadlines and workloads, and sharp-elbowed political jockeying. Reading some of the stories together might conjure up images more along the lines of “Lord of The Flies” than a sophisticated legal powerhouse. But Kirkland’s newest chairman, Jon A. Ballis, indicated in the same Bloomberg Law article that he’s trying to change that reputation. What he has to say speaks plenty about K&E, but even more about our industry as a whole.

Wolves In Wolves Clothing

Former K&E associates, of which there are many, report their experience as like working in a “den of wolves” where the mentality is “we can destroy everybody, so let’s actually go destroy other people.” Associate turnover is a constant, and it increased by a jaw-dropping 60% to 70% in 2021 according to Bloomberg Law. But when the paychecks and bonuses are as big as K&E can afford to throw around, there’s always someone else in line waiting to pick up the slack. As one former associate put it, “[It’s OK if you leave because we can just hire more people.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/associates-are-leaving-worlds-wealthiest-biglaw-firm-in-droves/)”

John Ballis, for his part, acknowledges the reputation K&E has in Biglaw, but he begs to differ. He contends that K&E has made strides to lessen competition and promote teamwork. However, Ballis doesn’t argue that even this new, cuddlier, friendlier Kirkland is a playground. If you’re not looking to work your tail off, K&E may not be the place for you. If you want to try for that Jordan Belfort, Wolf of Wall Street, yachts-and-Dom lifestyle, Kirkland might just give you that shot.

But should you take it?

The Downside Of Fantastic Wealth And Power

Yachts are great, but how much happiness do they provide you sitting in port? What’s the point of a summer home you never visit, or a Maserati you never drive? Fat stacks and other status symbols are undoubtedly fun to pursue and even more fun to have, but they can’t be the only thing you have in your life.

I’ve written in this space many times that, at our core, lawyers, staff, and members of every profession are happiest and most satisfied when they’re driven as a team by a common purpose. Maybe that purpose is service to a worthy industry, or striking a sustainable work-life blend. Maybe the common purpose is the team itself, spending time together, accomplishing goals, and seeing how far your team can push itself. Sometimes, the common purpose is making obscene amounts of money. That can work for those motivated by it, but it carries consequences.

This isn’t just a Kirkland thing. K&E is far from the only law firm in the world that demands ungodly numbers of hours from its people and burns through attorneys like they were tissues. But it is an exemplar of the form, and its model should give most of us pause as to whether it’s something we would want to emulate, especially if our goal isn’t money, but happiness.

For as fuzzy of a concept as happiness may be, there’s a surprising amount of scientific literature on the topic. One common recurring theme, as highlighted in [a recent Harvard study](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-secret-to-happiness-heres-some-advice-from-the-longest-running-study-on-happiness-2017100512543), is the important association between happiness and close interpersonal relationships, particularly spouses, family, friends, and social circles. Being part of a positive, supportive circle of people is a huge leading indicator of satisfaction and contentment. Conversely, one can imagine that spending 3,000-plus hours a year in a competitive professional pressure cooker might have an adverse impact on someone’s sense of inner calm.

And happiness and productivity don’t have to be mutually exclusive. A [new study](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/top-performers-have-a-superpower-happiness/?utm_source=release&utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=lest0222) published in MIT’s “Sloan Management Review” once again makes the case that happy workers are better workers. By ensuring our teams are tending to their lives outside the office, the product they generate in the office improves.

Choices, Choices

I love the practice of law, and I deeply admire the leadership of firms like Kirkland & Ellis for the innovation they drive and the ways they push our industry forward as a whole. For all the reported challenges, Kirkland & Ells is to be lauded for almost single-handedly reshaping an antiquated lockstep model that ignored economic realities and that didn’t directly reward individual performance. But there’s a sickness at the heart of the Biglaw model, and it’s one that tends to make you wealthier and, by many metrics, more successful, the more you give in to it. The more power and wealth are at stake, the more that sickness tends to lay itself bare.

In the hard-driving Japanese business culture, there’s a term called karoshi. It means “death by overwork.” Enough Japanese office workers have died as a result of working themselves to the bone that the language developed its own shorthand. We’re not there yet, but as salaries keep driving higher and pressure keeps mounting, we have to acknowledge that’s the road our industry is choosing to go down.

But choices need to be made, and tomorrow is always a chance to choose something new. It’s always up to us.

Here’s hoping we choose wisely.

Bonus season came early this year. We usually don’t get any bonus information in mid-September, but, well, 2020 is a strange year.

Cooley started the [COVID appreciation bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) game, offering associates between $2,500 and $7,500 as a special thank you from the firm for their hard work during the pandemic. But then [Davis Polk ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/)got involved with a new standard, and it just blew away the Cooley scale. Their bonuses started at $7,500 and went all the way up to $40,000. And firms [quickly](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/milbank-bonuses/) started [piling](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/irell-bonuses/) on this [new bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/sullivan-cromwell-makes-a-move-in-covid-19-bonus-war/) [scale.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/debevoise-bonuses/) Weil offered a seemingly unpopular [hours-based bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/weil-offers-a-new-take-on-fall-bonuses-theyre-hours-based-and-theyre-huge/), but, thus far, no one has jumped on board with that. And then there was the notable outlier: Kirkland — the [world’s richest law firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/the-global-100-the-richest-law-firms-in-the-world-2020/) — [begged off](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/) fall special bonuses, and seemed to be asking the market not to follow the trend.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
But with matches taking a bit longer than we’ve seen in recent years (seriously, we’ve heard nothing from Cravath, what is going on at the perpetual compensation leader??), it can be challenging to remember just which firms have stepped up. So, here you go, a handy-dandy chart to reference.

Update: Since we originally circulated this handy-dandy reference chart, we have gotten a lot of news about fall bonuses…. unfortunately, most of it wasn’t what associates were hoping for. [Cravath said no](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cravath-is-not-offering-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-pissed/) to special bonuses, opting to wait until the end of the year, as did [O’Melveny](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/omelveny-says-no-to-fall-bonuses-are-covid-appreciation-bonuses-over/), [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/paul-weiss-wont-be-offering-fall-bonuses-and-associates-are-angry/), [Fried Frank](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/fried-frank-no-bonuses/), [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/skadden-confirms-the-inevitable-no-fall-bonuses/), [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/goodwin-refuses-to-pay-special-fall-bonuses-promises-competitive-cash-come-january-2021/), and Cleary. Despite the fact that the Biglaw financials are better than ever, the[ firms seem to be content to keep the bonus money](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/whats-the-real-reason-biglaw-firms-are-begging-off-fall-bonuses/) in the firms’ coffers, at least until the year-end bonuses come around. But at least some folks are bucking that trend and showing associates appreciation the best way they know how, with money.

With so many elite Biglaw firms waiting until year end to make bonus decisions, keeping track of what peer firms are doing is a little trickier this year. But fear not, Above the Law will continue to monitor exactly what’s going on across the industry.

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Firm With Sterling Reputation Matches Biglaw Bonuses

After enough of these bonus posts, it’s impossible to find much interesting to say without resorting to cheap puns. I don’t want to do it, dear reader, it’s just all that’s left. How many times can one publication say, “another firm has declared ‘Cravath Jesus Take The Wheel'” and turned over its compensation authority to the whims of the big shots perched metaphorically alone upon Eighth Avenue and middle of nowhere street?

And so we find ourselves playing with Shearman & Sterling’s name. The venerable firm that brands itself as [a mid-range men’s shoe store](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/biglaw-firm-rebrands-and-the-new-logo-is-lets-just-say-unconventional/) gave its U.S. track associates the good news that they’ll be matching Cravath’s bonuses, payable on January 15, 2019.

Class of 2018 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2017 – $15,000
Class of 2016 – $25,000
Class of 2015 – $50,000
Class of 2014 – $65,000
Class of 2013 – $80,000
Class of 2012 – $90,000
Class of 2011 and above – $100,000

[](http://bit.ly/2UDEBO4)Lawyers, on average, bill less than 30 percent of their working day. That astonishing statistic is but one finding from Clio’s Legal Trends Report. Using aggregated and anonymized data from Clio, supplemented by large-scale research surveys, the report investigates some of the most pressing issues that ultimately determine success for law firms. The LTR is simultaneously the most comprehensive and the most granular analysis of lawyer activity ever published. Join us on April 2 at 1 p.m. ET for a can’t-miss webinar, [How to Evolve Into a Tech-Savvy Law Firm](http://bit.ly/2UDEBO4), that will expand on the LTR’s findings with expert insights.

Small and mid-sized firms often lack basic technology to make their operations efficient and maximize revenues. Our panel will explore how law firms can spend more time practicing the law instead of managing administrative tasks. Learn how you can better manage your firm, cases, and clients, and gain new visibility into your finances and operations.

Our panel will be moderated by ATL’s founding editor, David Lat. David will be joined by:

- T.C. Whittaker, Law Firm Solution Leader for PwC, where he is responsible for the strategy, operations, sales, and marketing of the firm’s latest technology for small and medium-sized law firms.
- Joshua Lenon, Clio’s Lawyer in Residence, where he provides legal scholarship and research skills to the leading cloud-based legal solutions platform.

# The First Biglaw Firm To Offer Billable Diversity Hours For All Timekeepers
## This initiative will recognize and reward all diversity-related work and activities at the firm.

Biglaw firms are finally starting to put their money where their mouth is when it comes to diversity and inclusion. At least two firms — [Dorsey & Whitney](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/biglaw-firm-introduces-diversity-hours-that-count-toward-associate-billable-requirements/) in 2019 and [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/care-about-biglaw-diversity-well-now-you-can-bill-for-it/) in 2021 — have announced that approved diversity and inclusion-related work will be billable for attorneys and will count toward bonus thresholds. Now, another leading law firm has stepped forward to announce that all timekeepers, not just lawyers, will be able to receive billable-hours credit for their diversity work. The firm is the first to offer a program like this.

Reed Smith, a firm that came in at #26 in the latest Am Law 100 rankings, announced this new policy earlier this week. Under this new protocol, all timekeepers at the firm will be able to allocate up to 50 hours of work and activities related to its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion program (DE&I), its Women Initiative Network program (WINRS), and its Racial Equity Action Plan (REAP) as billable time. This policy takes effect immediately and is retroactive to January 1, 2021. Here’s a very thorough list of what will be counted for billable credit at Reed Smith:

The DE&I, REAP and WINRS work and activities that qualify for credit include:

- Leading or organizing events, activities or projects;
- Serving in a leadership role on firm committees or sub-committees;
- Developing or delivering training programs related to diversity or gender issues;
- Presenting at, or preparing materials for use in, diversity- and gender-related programs;
- Attending training programs or conferences related to diversity or gender issues;
- Participating in Reed Smith’s reverse mentoring program, or serving as a mentor or sponsor in an effort to support diverse talent; and,
- Participating in client-sponsored or promoted diversity- and gender-related activities.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Casey Ryan, Reed Smith’s Global Head of Legal Personnel, explained the firm’s rationale behind offering diversity-related billable hours for all timekeepers:

This policy enhances our robust Associate Life initiative,” said “Working on diversity initiatives provides an opportunity to lead on issues of import, build leadership skills and make connections, all experiences that benefit associates in the development of their lawyering and other professional skills.

Reed Smith’s Global Managing Partner Sandy Thomas had this to say:

Building an inclusive culture is integral to our business and should be rewarded and incentivized, not left to chance. Diversity is an area where Reed Smith has always been a leader in the legal industry, and this new policy is a real investment behind our own commitment and goals.

The move to billable diversity-related hours is part of a larger effort at the firm. By 2024, Reed Smith hopes to see a 50% increase of Black lawyers, improvement of Black lawyer and staff attrition rates, and an increase in the percentage of Black leadership in the firm. Billable credit is a great way to make sure everyone at the firm is pulling toward these very important goals.

# 3 Reasons To Embrace The Rise Of Non-Equity Partners
## Not every firm can be a Cravath or a Cleary (or a Davis or a Debevoise).

What do we talk about when we talk about partnership? Last month, a widely read Wall Street Journal article by Sara Randazzo, [Being a Law Firm Partner Was Once a Job for Life — That Culture Is All but Dead](https://www.wsj.com/articles/being-a-law-firm-partner-was-once-a-job-for-life-that-culture-is-all-but-dead-11565362437), raised this question. It also generated a lot of discussion, much of it negative, about law firms’ increasing use of non-equity partnership.

The rise of the non-equity partner has been criticized on a number of grounds. First, it lets equity partners jack up the billing rates of non-equity partners, often to north of $1,000, without having to share the wealth with them (or take a hit in the American Lawyer’s closely watched “profits per partner” or “PPP” rankings, which consider only equity partners).

Second, as argued by my former colleague [Joe Patrice](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/repeat-after-me-partnership-without-equity-is-not-a-partnership/?rf=1), it’s fundamentally dishonest: “Can’t we all just go back to a reality-based vernacular? If the attorney is not a partner in the enterprise, they are not a ‘partner.’ If attorneys want more recognition for career advancement, then do a better job of branding the importance of the firm’s counsel. This whole thing has gotten out of hand.”

There’s validity to these critiques. But since the non-equity partner role isn’t going away — if anything, it’s on the rise (in 2000, 78 percent of partners were equity partners, while in 2018, only 56 percent were) — let’s consider the advantages, to lawyers and law firms:

1. The cocktail party effect. Lawyers are obsessed with prestige — and it’s far more prestigious to be able to claim at a cocktail party that you’re a “partner,” as opposed to a “counsel” or an “associate.”

Most non-lawyers won’t know the difference. And even if the non-lawyer does know about the divide between equity and non-equity partners, it would be quite gauche for the person to ask, “But are you an equity partner?”

Sometimes you can guess, based on factors like seniority, whether someone is an equity or non-equity partner. But much of the time, it’s a secret known only to the firms (which is why it’s so hard to get good data on diversity, or the lack thereof, in Biglaw equity partnerships).

2. The business development advantage. This is an offshoot of the cocktail party effect. It’s much easier to land clients, especially large corporate clients, if you can introduce yourself as a “partner.”

As a recruiter, I sometimes work with candidates who, based on how long they’ve been practicing, could be counsels or partners. I ask these candidates how strongly they feel about title. Some say it’s not important, but others say — and understandably so — “If I’m going to build a practice, I need to have that ‘partner’ title.”

3. Greater flexibility and a longer runway.The traditional partnership model was “up or out”: if you didn’t make partner after the prescribed period, you had to find yourself another job. The new model of “partnership,” featuring the non-equity role, allows firms to hold on to talented lawyers for longer; these lawyers can continue to service clients, often in niche areas, without worrying about having or building a book of business. (Yes, counsels can do this too — but see the two other advantages of non-equity partnership, supra.)

In the case of laterals, if they come in as non-equity partners, they can have a longer time period (aka “runway”) to build their practice; they don’t immediately need to be super-profitable, as a lockstep firm with super-high PPP might want or expect. This lets firms “take a chance” on a lateral. If the choice is binary — “admit this candidate to your lockstep, single-tier partnership, which will immediately involve paying them $1.5 million a year or more, or pass” — many firms will simply say “pass.” I suspect many candidates would rather be non-equity partners than not at a firm at all.

So, in the end, what should we make of “non-equity partnership”? I used to be fairly negative on it, perhaps because of a youthful snobbery in favor of the Cravaths and Clearys of the world, finding the whole notion déclassé. But as I’ve gotten to learn more about the legal industry, first as a journalist and now as a legal recruiter, I now know that not every firm can be a Cravath or a Cleary (or a Davis or a Debevoise) — and there’s nothing wrong with that.

# Game Of Owns: The 2022 FedSoc Convention
## Annual gathering aims to silence woke heretics... misses spectacularly.

The Federalist Society national convention kicked off with Judge William Pryor mocking Above the Law for insinuating that the organization is a bunch of ideological hacks in a monologue that was “funny” to the extent it amounted to a quarter hour of self-owns. A day later, FedSoc proved its hackery when the Board voted to bar its founder and co-chair from identifying himself to the media as either a “founder” or “co-chair” — a move that backfired when Steven Calabresi’s immediate response was to tell the media that the Board had voted to bar him from calling himself the founder or co-chair. Please do not let these people write your contracts! We also discuss “Paul Clement’s Lament” that law firms care more about money than his passion project of making America objectively worse and more dangerous. And more news of bubbling layoffs!

# What March Madness Can Teach Us About Law Firm Parity
## The strategy of prestigious firms to extend their national platform to smaller markets does not always translate into the best option for those seeking legal counsel.

Like many others, I opened my March Madness bracket today and reflected on the slew of shocking upsets that make the annual tournament so exciting, and my bracket dead in the water. My West finals are already moot under the uprising of the fiery GCU, and my South division is completely upended by Oakland’s takedown of famed coach John Calipari’s Kentucky team. Talking heads were quick to point out that for how venerated this team and Coach Calipari are, the reputation of both has been coasting on their 2012 title champions, with their last final four appearance coming in 2015. 

I thought about the parallels in Biglaw, where reputation is so paramount firms line up to spill their financial details to grab the vaunted title of “Am Law 200.” A lot has changed since my first year at Harvard Law School in 2001. That year, only Skadden crossed the $1 billion threshold in gross revenue; last year, 51 firms did so. The average number of attorneys at all Am Law 200 firms grew from 398 that year to 717 in FY 2022. 

Firms have become larger by not only accreting attorneys in their profit centers like New York and Los Angeles, but by countless mergers, acquisitions of regional firms, and opening new offices in markets that would have once been considered secondary or tertiary markets. Because they often have clients willing to pay top rates for top-tier legal services in smaller markets like Charlotte and New Orleans, they are able to extend their national platform to service these industries. 

Yet, the strategy of prestigious firms extending their national platform to smaller markets, despite the allure of clients willing to pay top rates for premier legal services in places like Charlotte and New Orleans, does not always translate into the best option for those seeking legal counsel. From the client’s perspective, paying a premium for legal work with the expectation of unmatched expertise and service, there can be a disconnect when the regional practice of a large, prestigious firm is less supported than their profit centers. This puts them at a disadvantage when compared to a less renowned, yet robust regional firm that possesses a profound understanding of and connection to the local market. The intimate knowledge and connections of a strong regional player can often deliver more tailored, effective, and efficient solutions, at a better price point. 

For partners in these secondary markets, the allure of operating within a prestigious name can similarly be misleading. Your book of business may flourish more under the umbrella of a regional firm that offers both a full-service platform and better support in your city. A smaller, focused firm can provide the kind of personalized attention and resources that a larger firm’s leaner crew in a secondary market simply cannot match, enhancing both client satisfaction and the partner’s ability to grow their practice.

If you’re contemplating a strategic shift, whether to capitalize on the strengths of a regional powerhouse or to navigate the complexities of market-specific legal practices, your journey demands a partner with in-depth knowledge and a tailored approach.

## * Settlements have been reached between Berkeley Law, the school's former dean, and the dean's former assistant. If you recall, then dean Sujit Chaudry was accused of sexually harassing his assistant, and as part of the settlement, he'll have to pay $100K in fees and charitable donations, but will be considered to be on ""sabbatical"" until May 2018, keeping all of his benefits. Hmm, do we think this is fair? [[Mercury News](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/04/14/uc-berkeley-settles-suits-over-law-dean-sexual-allegations/)] * ""We have not livestreamed before, but that's not to say that won't happen in this case."" The Fourth Circuit is considering livestreaming oral arguments for travel ban 2.0, much like what the Ninth Circuit did with oral arguments for Trump's first travel ban. Maybe you'll be able to do some ""professional development"" billing...

Judge Kristine G. Baker (E.D. Ark.) has halted a whirlwind series of eight executions -- the state's first executions scheduled since 2005 -- citing a ""threat of irreparable harm"" if the drug midazolam is used as part of the lethal injection drug protocol and somehow fails. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/15/us/arkansas-executions.html?_r=0)] * More and more out-of-state Biglaw firms are flocking to Houston, Texas, to open their own offices, which has inspired many lawyers to leave their current firms for greener pastures -- in terms of both money and opportunities. But is there enough legal work to go around with all of the new competition? Only time will tell. [[Houston Chronicle](http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/New-law-firms-spur-job-hopping-among-lawyers-11075905.php)] * Ten Harvard Law student affinity groups are gunning for Professor David B.

Yesterday, Milbank became a trendsetter and blessed its attorneys with an unexpected salary increase. Refusing to be tardy to the party, McKool Smith has matched the scale for its hardworking billers.



McKool’s clients know it for its phenomenal intellectual property and bankruptcy work. Bankers will know McKool’s employees by the new smiles they’ll be brandishing under their masks at the bank teller’s table. At least, they would if people still used banks. They’ll probably just be getting the money directly deposited to their bank accounts, but that isn’t nearly as interesting of a mental picture.

(Turn to the next page to see the McKool Smith memo.)

We like hearing about salary increases almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Magic Circle Firm Provides Domestic Violence Assistance For Employees
## The first such program in the legal industry.

Well, this is encouraging.

Magic Circle firm Linklaters has launched a new program for its U.K. employees to support those who are living in abusive situations. And the firm is backing up that commitment to its employees with cold, hard cash. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/08/03/linklaters-offers-accommodation-and-funds-to-staff-affected-by-domestic-abuse-292-71624/) Law.com, employees will have access to emergency accommodations, additional funds, and they’ll get up to 10 days paid leave, as well as access to services from U.K. charity Surviving Economic Abuse.

Linklaters will offer support to employees, and their children, who need to flee their home in an emergency, including funding three nights’ accommodation in a hotel and providing a daily living expenses allowance, the firm announced.

Additionally, Linklaters will offer affected employees access to a one-off payment of up to $6,500 to support an individual in becoming financially and physically independent from their abuser.

There will be no requirement to repay the firm and the money can be paid in a variety of means to ensure that the individual has full control of it, the firm added.

This program is launched against a backdrop of increased incidences of domestic violence. There’s reportedly been a spike in domestic violence since the onset of COVID-19 work from home policies. Linklaters global diversity and inclusion partner David Martin said of the new program:

“The future of how and where we work remains uncertain. For now, our homes are now our workplaces and it is clearer than ever that domestic abuse is a workplace issue.

“We have introduced this comprehensive package of support because we want to send a clear message to any of our people living with abuse that they are not alone, we care, and the help they need is available to them.”

Let’s hope other firms take notice and start their own programs to address domestic violence.

# Performance Evaluations -- Phooey!  
## Whatever supervisors may think about their direct reports, they owe them the courtesy and candor of performance evaluations provided on a timely basis.

That’s what I thought as an HR lawyer and that’s what I think to this day. Why phooey? My thoughts:

It’s a perfect opportunity to sandbag employees you supervise. Rather than giving them feedback and coaching during the appraisal period, the supervisor waits until the annual review to critique an employee’s performance. Instead of helping employees improve, a disappointing annual review — or what I call a “sandbag” review — only exacerbates performance issues and creates hard feelings.

Lawyers aren’t any different than other employers. They wish problem employees would just magically disappear. However, as many employers have learned to their dismay, that usually doesn’t happen and, if it does, it’s often accompanied by a severance agreement.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Even if a performance evaluation is more frequent than annually, that doesn’t necessarily solve the problem. The employee and the employer (supervisor, manager, whatever the title) disagree about what the performance issues are and how to resolve them. Merely giving the employee a “PIP” (Performance Improvement Plan) doesn’t mean a thing. It’s the coaching and the mentoring to improve performance, rather than merely discussing the plan (if there is even any discussion), asking the employee to sign it, and returning it to the HR Department.

What are performance deficiencies? One of the biggest ones for lawyers is, of course, billable hours. How about insufficient client development? Not “up to snuff” work product, inability to get along with colleagues, and there’s always the “just doesn’t fit in”  ever popular “round peg in square hole” fallback?

Often, it’s “up or out,” bill more hours or you’re toast. Bring in more clients, or at least a client or two. Polish up that work product, and be kind and respectful of colleagues, especially support staff. You either improve forthwith or you’re gone, and in today’s “eat what you kill” environment, those seem to be the choices.

Not a very pleasant “either/or” but one that many lawyers face, whether as newbies or as whatever career stage they are in. It’s never too late to show a colleague the door, and the psychic, reputational, financial devastation may never be completely alleviated.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Spending time writing and then administering performance evaluations is never fun. There are more than [half a million samples](https://www.google.com/search?q=performance+evaluation+comments&rlz=1CARJNJ_enUS771US771&oq=performance&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l4j69i60l2.16849j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) (who knew?) of language to use in writing them and in responding to them. One need never be at a loss for words, not that we ever are.

Even if it’s a good evaluation, but not quite as good as previous ones, there’s still pushback. The supervisor is different from the prior one and decides to evaluate on “a curve.” Employees who previously received stellar evaluations now receive ones that are merely “meh.” Affected employees are knocked back on their heels. “The goal posts have moved,” which is often the refrain as the explanation for the downgrade, the unstated goal of that supervisor to manage that employee out.

Since in most, if not all, cases, writing and discussing performance evaluations are not considered billable time, they often go to the bottom of the to-do pile unless human resources gets on the case. Even then, the task falls by the wayside.

Whatever supervisors may think about their direct reports, they owe them the courtesy and candor of performance evaluations provided on a timely basis. Some supervisors may disagree. Disagree to your heart’s content, but when it’s time to terminate an employee for poor performance or other metric, and there’s nothing in the file to support the termination request, it’s not a pretty picture.

When an employee protests the evaluation and writes a response, too often the response is just made part of the employee record, without any evaluation as to whether the employee’s complaints may be justified or meritless.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Humans are pains in the butts. How many times have we thought or said to each other that the practice of law would be fun without the clients? Too many times to count.

There are people who make good, if not great, managers, and there are others that should be only individual contributors and have no management responsibility. Managing your staff, having frequent conversations about what is working and what is not, and encouraging your subordinates to improve are [definite time sucks](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/249332/harm-good-truth-performance-reviews.aspx).

Almost twenty-five years ago, Mr. I.’s supervisor wrote his evaluation, saying that “He is not an enlightened or brilliantly creative man, but with a strong board, he could absolutely do the job.” Fifteen years ago, an associate dean at the Yale School of Management said that Mr. I. was “a loyal drone” and that expectations for him were low. How cutting and what a lack of insight.

Now, in 2020, that “loyal drone,” that “not enlightened or brilliantly creative man” also known as Robert Iger, the CEO who expanded the Mouse House (aka Disney) and transformed the entire entertainment industry, has stepped down as CEO. Why do I mention him?

He is Exhibit A for why performance evaluations do not necessarily mean that one is doomed to permanent professional failure. An evaluation that is thoughtful, carefully crafted, and encouraging (let’s agree that the employee always does at least one thing well) can go a long way.

However, if the evaluation is harsh and unforgiving, then all we have to do is look at the rates of depression, addiction, and death by suicide among us to know the toll that such an evaluation can take. So, for the employee: keep going. For the employer: recognize that ability and talent can take many forms and can take time to flourish. Very few of us are overnight successes.

# Biglaw Associate Awarded $6.3 Million Verdict For Traumatic Brain Injury Suffered In Firm's Parking Garage
## The injury caused the 'smart, young, up-and-coming attorney' to leave the legal profession entirely.

What happens when you’re a young attorney on your way into work and you suffer a traumatic brain injury after hitting your head on a low-hanging pipe in your Biglaw firm’s parking garage? You’re awarded millions of dollars after winning a jury trial for the grievous injury that’s caused you to leave the legal profession.

Meet Aja Diamond McCoy (née Moore), who had been an associate at Hunton & Williams when an accident occurred that changed her life. In December 2013, McCoy hit her head on a pipe that was about 5 feet above the sidewalk next to the spot where she backed her car into her firm’s garage. She’s not the only person who’d been injured by the pipe — it seems that a paralegal from another firm in the building did the same thing, but in McCoy’s case, the injury incapacitated the “smart, young, up-and-coming attorney,” changing the course of her life.

One of McCoy’s attorneys, John Mabrey of the Mabrey Firm, said, “Her cognitive skills are fine. It was the pain. The head pain is unpredictable and severe.” What’s worse is that the medications his client takes to treat her pain have “debilitating” side effects.

The [Daily Report](https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2019/03/26/atlanta-lawyer-injured-in-firm-parking-garage-awarded-8m-verdict/) has the breakdown of McCoy’s jury award:

The jury deliberated for about 3½ hours following a four-day trial before Fulton County State Court Judge John Mather, Mabrey said. The verdict totaled slightly more than $8 million. The biggest portion—$4.4 million—was for future lost wages. The jury awarded another $2.5 million for noneconomic damages. Another $500,000 was awarded for past lost wages. The remaining $212,000 was for medical expenses.

The jury apportioned 21.75 percent of the fault to McCoy and 78.25 percent to the parking garage, reducing the total award to $6.3 million.

Best of luck to Aja Diamond McCoy as she continues to recover from her injuries.

[](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/mario-leissner-from-king-spalding-episode-6)In last week’s episode of [Book of Business](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/), veteran legal recruiter [Robert Kinney](http://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/) and I interviewed a top European dealmaker. In this week’s episode, we interview another prominent corporate lawyer, but from the other side of the globe.

Since 2000, [James Grandolfo](https://www.milbank.com/en/professionals/james-grandolfo.html) of Milbank Tweed has been working out of Hong Kong, advising clients across all of Asia. On the podcast, Jim spoke with us about how he first came to work in Asia, the strengths and weaknesses of the Asian legal market(s), and how he built one of the region’s preeminent practices.

If you’re a partner at a leading law firm who might be interested in joining us on Book of Business, please feel free to email me and Robert Kinney, subject line “Book of Business.” I can be reached at [dlat@abovethelaw.com](mailto:dlat@abovethelaw.com?subject=Book%20of%20Business), and Robert Kinney can be reached at [robert@kinneyrecruiting.com](mailto:robert@kinneyrecruiting.com?subject=Book%20of%20Business).

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

It’s November 10, and Thanksgiving is just two weeks away, which means that bonus season is right around the corner. Wouldn’t it be nice if your law firm gave you a little something extra to be thankful for this year? We sure think it would be!

As a little reminder — as if you really needed one — this is what last year’s [Milbank bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/) (yes, Milbank; [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/) later followed along) looked like:

Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012 – $100,000
Class of 2011 – $100,000

These year-end bonuses are, of course, in addition to the appreciation bonuses that some firms handed out earlier this fall to thank their associates for their dedication during the coronavirus crisis. [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) set the standard on those bonuses, which ranged from $7,500 to $40,000. This year, there will truly be different tiers set for compensation if not all firms offer additional bonus dollars to their associates on top of their standard bonuses to truly match the market.

For those of you who are wondering when your bank accounts will be a little more flush, here’s a list of the dates when year-end market bonuses hit Biglaw since 2006, the very first year Above the Law started publishing bonus news. Take a look:

With visions of bonus dollars dancing in your heads, it’s time to check in on how people are doing with their billable hours. There are eight weeks to go in 2020, and even though COVID-19 may have put a damper on your hours, hitting your target is still important. Some firms might make bank-busting payments, but not all associates will hit the hours mark necessary for the top dollar.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Still, with two months to go, there’s plenty of time to get on your hours. Don’t be surprised if attorneys start poking around for an extra discrete assignment or two — after all, some hours here and there could mean a world of difference.

So how are people doing during a pandemic that nearly paralyzed the legal profession? Take our poll, and get a sense of how many hours your peers are on pace to hit in 2020. While you’re at it, let us know when you think this year’s bonuses will drop, and whether they’ll be higher or lower than last year’s bonuses.

How many hours are you on track to bill in 2020?

## * ""You never say no, but I’d rather help him find someone else who can do it. I’m very happy not being in the government."" Word on the street is that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is being considered for attorney general in the Trump administration, but the Greenberg Traurig partner doesn't exactly seem interested. Hmm, perhaps Governor Chris Christie will be AG after all? [[Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-transition-team-planning-first-months-in-office-1478699360) (sub. req.)] * Judge Gonzalo Curiel is now urging litigants on both sides of the Trump University case to settle, noting that ""[i]t would be wise for the plaintiffs, for the defendants, to look closely at trying to resolve this case given all else that's involved."" The judge who President-elect Trump once accused of being biased due to his Mexican heritage is now trying to save Trump from being on trial for fraud early in his presidency. [[Reuters](http://reuters.com/article/USLegal/idUSL1N1DB0Q1?il=0)] * The hits just keep on coming for King & Wood Mallesons. The firm's Australian and Chinese partnerships will likely be bailing out its troubled European and Middle Eastern offices, but Stuart Fuller, its managing global partner, has decided to step down by the year's end, which has prompted an immediate search for a successor. Fuller will remain a partner with the firm, and will return to full-time practice in 2017.

VetLex will be the first nationwide network dedicated to legal service referrals for veterans. The program will ""revolutionize the way we deliver pro bono resources to veterans.""

Aaron Schock of Illinois has been indicted for defrauding the government out of about $100,000 after allegedly submitting false invoices for the costs of redecorating his office with a ""Downton Abbey"" motif and various personal expenses. Schock's attorney says the government is ""criminalizing a handful of administrative mistakes"" made by his client -- six figures worth of alleged mistakes.

Has the coronavirus affected the volume of trade secret filings? What are the most active venues for trade secret cases? Who is the most active plaintiff? And are damage awards changing?

These are just a few of the questions addressed in Lex Machina and LexisNexis’s new Trade Secret Litigation Report,
which covers federal court trends from 2016-20. 

[Click here for an infographic detailing its key findings.](https://lexmachina.com/resources/infographic-trade-secret-report/)

The metrics in this report can help you decide whom to pursue as clients, whether to pursue a particular motion, or when to settle. 

You’ll learn:

- Whether trade secret case filings have remained steady since 2017, even through the pandemic;
- The judges and venues hearing the most cases;
- The most active plaintiffs and plaintiffs firms;
- The most active defense firms;
- The frequency of settlement in trade secrets cases; and
- The biggest awards — and trends in damages.

# Biglaw Associates Are Growing Increasingly Worried About Layoffs
## It's the big 'what if' for associates that everyone is dwelling on right now.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

You always wake up feeling ‘I could be could be next.’ It’s not at the kind of panic level right now, but a slow broil, where you feel, especially if you’re having a less busy work day, ‘what if we’re next,’ and ‘what if this quietness means that I’m useless and not contributing enough to the firm and I’m actually just dead weight that the firm needs to get rid of.’ That kind of thinking works its way into your bones.”

— An associate working at a U.S. Biglaw firm in London, in anonymous [comments given to Law.com International](https://www.law.com/2023/05/14/we-could-be-next-as-law-firms-swing-the-axe-associates-are-getting-anxious-292-151576/), concerning the hushed fear of layoffs that’s spread among associates in the wake of associate layoffs being made in both the US and the UK.

# Biglaw Partners In Support Of Dennis Hastert
## A well-deserved loss for these Biglaw partners.

Dennis Hastert

Corporate or litigation, Biglaw or small, one thing that all lawyers are good at is writing a strongly worded letter. I bet half of you reading this now are supposed to be using this time to write a letter. But just because you can write a killer letter, it doesn’t mean you should.

I say this because two Biglaw partners, [Tyrone Fahner](https://www.mayerbrown.com/people/Tyrone-C-Fahner/) of Mayer Brown and [Frederick Lowther](https://www.blankrome.com/index.cfm?contentID=10&bioID=3305) of Blank Rome according to the National Law Journal, wrote letters in support of Dennis Hastert. Yes, that Hastert. The longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House and the one who pleaded guilty to bank fraud and lying to authorities about it as part of a scheme to pay hush money to his alleged child molestation victims. A real gem, this guy.

And today, at his sentencing hearing, Hastert [admitted in court](http://gawker.com/dennis-haster-longest-serving-republican-speaker-of-th-1773397725) that the allegations of sexual abuse against him were true:

“I mistreated some of my athletes that I coached,” Hastert admitted Wednesday at his sentencing hearing. “I’m deeply ashamed to be standing before you today.”

When the judge [specifically asked him](https://twitter.com/natashakorecki/status/725354359542919168) if he’d sexually abused a former student named Stephen Reinboldt, Hastert said, “Yes.”

But despite what “their guy” would go on to admit in open court, the letters Fahner and Lowther wrote in support of Hastert painted a picture of a kind, industrious, and dedicated man:

“Whatever conduct is alleged, I know Denny as a kind, strong, principled, unselfish man,” [wrote](http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/Fahner%20letter%20Hastert%20NLJ.pdf) Fahner, a former Illinois attorney general. “I urge the Court to permit him to live the rest of his life in freedom with his family and friends, and all of those who love and admire him. I wish to be counted among them.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Whatever conduct is alleged”? That takes the cake for lawyerish non-statements, because let’s not forget the conduct alleged is serial CHILD MOLESTATION. Despite the origination of the case against Hastert (bank fraud stemming from hush money over the sexual abuse), this isn’t some vague financial crime where there are no real victims. We know who they are, and they were children when it happened.

[Lowther’s letter](http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/Lowther%20letter%20Hastert%20NLJ.pdf) provides some insight to Hastert’s work there [at Blank Rome]. He traveled with Lowther to Japan in 2011 shortly after a tsunami led to a partial meltdown of a nuclear power plant to help U.S companies assist Japan’s energy industry, the letter says. In another matter for an unnamed client, Hastert was “instrumental” in addressing the “sudden and unjustified” detention by China of an employee who allegedly was selling “state secrets.”

“In all my years practicing law, I never met a person who could bring people together to solve problems like he could,” Lowther wrote of Hastert.

Hey, here’s a thought. Maybe there is another euphemism you can use besides “bring[ing] people together.” He is, after all, accused of sexual abuse.

In total, there were 41 total letters filed with U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin in support of Hastert. Including one from CIA Director Porter Goss, who called Hastert “a rock solid guy with center-of-the country values.” This says something about the moral compass of the CIA, or the center-of-the country, or both.

But this pandering did not work; this morning, Judge Durkin sentenced Hastert to 15 months in prison, plus two years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine. According to the judge, the only reason the sentence is so short is that the statute of limitations has run out on the molestation charges and he specifically said Hastert’s age should not be a factor in sentencing him.

# Making The Most Of Conferences
## If your company is spending the money and investing in its or your development, then strive to get the most out of the experience.

As the weather cools and pumpkins start to appear, it’s a sign of … wait for it … conference season! So spruce up your LinkedIn (or remember your business cards), pack your carry-on — and leave plenty of room to bring back swag. Here are a few tips to make the most out of your conference.

Be Present

As difficult as it is, do your best to unplug from work and be present at the conference. This means that you prepared your clients for your short absence, enlisted backup from your team, and crafted and deployed your out of office message.

I suspect that many of you may be giving me the eye roll — but hear me out. If your company is spending the money and investing in its or your development, then strive to get the most out of the experience by being fully present. Don’t misunderstand me — I completely understand that you may need to skim your email for time-sensitive issues or return a call during a break — but do push these interruptions to a break, if you are able. At the end of the day, if you are simply remote working the entire time from the conference, then attendance was a waste of your time, and the cost of attendance was a waste of your company’s money.

Take Notes

While this may sound obvious, a little intention is helpful here, such as considering how you will take notes. Personally, taking notes in an old-fashioned notebook works best for me:

- I don’t have to worry about keeping my laptop charged.
- Having my laptop open will tempt me to check my email and “multitask,” which would obviate my presence (see above).
- Taking handwritten notes helps me better retain content.

If going analog is too archaic for you, consider a smaller device, such as an iPad with detachable keyboard or pen. The smaller footprint is easier to carry from session to session and doesn’t take too much space at a shared table or create as much of a barrier with other attendees.

The reason for taking notes — other than personal learning — is to flag issues and important highlights to share with your team upon return. Our labor and employment team tries to diversify our attendance across various conferences, a strategic “divide and conquer” approach so we can leverage shared information when we regroup.

Be Social

I don’t believe this is a secret, but it is important enough to emphasize that a valuable part of attending a conference is the informal networking that occurs before, between, and after sessions. It is the relationships formed and fortified, the bench-marking and information-sharing that may arguably be even more important than the formal presentations.

As an introvert and tired mom of three, including an infant, a quiet hotel room is a sanctuary that I would not forego lightly. Instead, I am intentional about slipping to my room to pump and about grabbing some quiet time to recharge. I’m also intentional about choosing which networking events I can best meet people at to have meaningful conversations and still get a good night’s sleep.

I also leverage LinkedIn to add people as I meet them or hear them speak.

Follow Up

I may be a bit extra about follow up, but I try to follow up with particular contacts of interest either by email or on LinkedIn during the first week I return to the office, before I — or the people I meet — forget. I also like to type up my notes and review slides at the airport or on my flight home, again before I forget. Lastly, I try to share the information I learned with my colleagues either the week I return or within two weeks, schedule permitting. I personally find that the longer I wait, the less likely any of this will happen.

Happy conferencing!

# Morning Docket: 06.24.19
## * During an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" President Trump falsely claimed that he “inherited” the policy of separating children from their parents at the border from President Obama, and later went on to defend the conditions that migrant children are being detained in, saying, “We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.” [[NBC News](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/23/trump-falsely-says-obama-started-family-separation/1540733001/)] * The Supreme Court will soon be ending its October 2018 term, and there are still a dozen controversial cases yet to be decided. Which eagerly awaited ruling(s) will be released today? [[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-cases/supreme-court-set-to-decide-major-census-electoral-maps-cases-idUSKCN1TO0D7)] * “So many D.C. lawyers are actors at heart. This is the drama of our time.” The Mead Center for American Theater is planning an 11-hour dramatic reading of the Mueller report. Several lawyers have signed up to read, but we wonder who will get to say Don McGahn’s famous lines. [[National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/2019/06/21/stage-is-set-for-dramatic-reading-of-the-mueller-report/)] * One woman may have [settled her sex discrimination claims](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/gender-discrimination-lawsuit-against-jones-day-dropped-well-one-of-them-at-least/) against Jones Day, but another just joined the gender bias class-action against the firm, bringing the total number of plaintiffs to eight.

* During an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” President Trump falsely claimed that he “inherited” the policy of separating children from their parents at the border from President Obama, and later went on to defend the conditions that migrant children are being detained in, saying, “We’re doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.” [[NBC News](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/23/trump-falsely-says-obama-started-family-separation/1540733001/)]

* The Supreme Court will soon be ending its October 2018 term, and there are still a dozen controversial cases yet to be decided. Which eagerly awaited ruling(s) will be released today?

* “So many D.C. lawyers are actors at heart. This is the drama of our time.” The Mead Center for American Theater is planning an 11-hour dramatic reading of the Mueller report. Several lawyers have signed up to read, but we wonder who will get to say Don McGahn’s famous lines. [[National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/2019/06/21/stage-is-set-for-dramatic-reading-of-the-mueller-report/)]

* One woman may have [settled her sex discrimination claims](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/gender-discrimination-lawsuit-against-jones-day-dropped-well-one-of-them-at-least/) against Jones Day, but another just joined the gender bias class-action against the firm, bringing the total number of plaintiffs to eight.

Above the Law is putting together our fifth annual list of the [top law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/the-2021-outside-counsel-rankings-the-top-law-firms-according-to-gcs/), according to the people who know best — you, the in-house attorneys who hire them. 

Amid all the ways of rating and ranking large law firms, from deal tables to profits-per-partner to associate satisfaction, there is no more valuable method of assessment than one based on clients’ actual experiences.

That’s why we are inviting in-house lawyers to share your perspectives on the firms you work with. Please take this [brief, anonymous survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3gemHFXLZ9J3Gpo) and tell us which law firms you use and why they are so great (or, perhaps, not so great).

Plus, if you’d like to be considered for a $250 gift card, please enter your email address when prompted at the end of the survey. This survey is anonymous and you will be contacted only if you are randomly selected as the winner.

# Elite Biglaw Firm Gently Reminds Associates To Get Back To The Office After 'Remote August'
## Associates will have to work from the office Tuesday through Thursday each week.

The dog days of summer are here, and for those who are working at Biglaw firms that adopted a “remote August” plan, the clock is ticking on their full-time work-from-home flexibility. Earlier this week, one of the top firms in the nation emailed all of its associates to let them know just how little time they had left before an in-office work requirement would kick in for them.

Skadden Arps — a firm that came in at No. 5 on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking after bringing in $3,022,380,000 gross revenue in 2021 — has permitted all of its attorneys to work remotely this month, but once September rolls around, things will look a little different for the firm.

Executive partner Eric Friedman noted in a memo that associates would be required back in the office three days each week — on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday — starting the week of September 12. From the memo:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We remain committed to our hybrid model, and believe that having critical mass in the office on those three days will enhance collaboration while continuing to provide you with flexibility to work remotely for a significant part of each week.”

It’s great to see that a firm as prestigious as Skadden is sticking to its hybrid working model, and it’s our hope that other firms will commit themselves to remaining flexible with remote work opportunities in the wake of the pandemic. After all, Biglaw firms posted record profits while associates were working from home, so there’s really no reason to curtail remote work.

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Skadden.)

Is your firm mandating a three-day, in-office workweek? As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.

# What Really Goes On Behind Closed Doors When A Biglaw Partner Gropes An Associate
## Here's a hint: the partner is still working at the firm.

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. Today, we have a story about a drunken encounter between a Biglaw partner and two women, both associates, who were forced to endure sexual harassment from a man who had a well-known reputation for this kind of behavior at the firm. These are real emails that we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law. We owe it to ourselves and to future generations of women in the law.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
This was several years ago when I worked in Biglaw, and this happened at the litigation practice group retreat, which, that year, was held at a remote property in Northern Georgia — think something straight out of The Shining. Of course, the bar had been flowing since the early afternoon, and by the time it was the official “cocktail hour” or “welcome hour” or “happy hour,” most of the attorneys, but particularly the partners, especially those who were escaping the wife and kids for the weekend, were trashed. For example, the managing partner of the practice group was so bombed he was slurring his words to the point where he would inadvertently spit red wine at you as you talked to him.

At any rate, me and one of my friends, a female coworker (we’ll call her “A”) were awaiting the arrival of our third partner in crime (we’ll call her “B”) who pulled the short straw and got stuck at the office while everyone else was boozing in the woods. We had already convinced the bartender to give us a bottle of vodka and mixers that we could take to the room I was sharing with B and had invited our other friends to come to our room so we didn’t have to drink around people we didn’t like (sorry, not sorry).

A and B had recently had a trade secret case involving sippy cups, and A thought it would be funny to bring sippy cups to the party in mine and B’s room for us to drink from. The packaging on the sippy cup said something pretty tongue-in-cheek (for adults) like “helps with proper sucking” — something to that effect.

B finally arrives and A gives her a sippy cup and the three of us start to head to our room to begin the real party. As we’re about to leave the conference room, a VERY drunk senior partner in an office where none of us practiced (we’ll call him “C”) asks us “where we think we’re going,” proceeds to wrap his arms around mine and B’s waists, caress our lower backs and waistlines, and complimenting us on how “pretty” we are. Gross. In an attempt to get away, B and I are like, “oh, we’ll be back, we just have to drop this off in our room,” and C’s basically like, “great I’ll come too,” and starts forcing us to walk back to where the rooms are located. C was not in the best shape, and we were convinced that between B and I we could take him, but C just would not get the hint and kept pushing us down the hallway. We misdirected him, and in the kerfuffle C sees B’s sippy cup and makes a comment about how she doesn’t need that because she probably doesn’t have a problem with “sucking.” Yeah. Gross. Luckily, we run into some male associates who distract C and presumably he eventually found his way back to the bar.

A, B, and I are silent about it for the rest of the retreat and at the office, until some partner confronts A about hearing that B and I got groped by C, who apparently has established quite a reputation for himself in that regard that was well-known by the firm. Despite the fact that neither B nor I reported the behavior directly, HR “investigated” the whole thing by GRILLING both B and I several times with various partners and HR present, instructing us not to talk to each other about the incident, and asking to see our cell phones and personal emails to see if anything had been discussed between us. This is a Southern firm, so they’re not exactly cutting edge with wokeness. Additionally, during the course of the investigation, both B and I learned that C actually was the billing partner for a major portfolio of litigation matters we had been handling. I got the distinct impression that if I ruffled too many feathers, that work would be taken from me, which would have killed my billable hours. I had another job offer that I was most likely going to accept, so I ultimately downplayed what happened as C being “too drunk” and was like, “maybe we should have a mechanism for controlling partners’ and associates’ alcohol intake,” rather than focusing on the sexual harassment and assault angle. In my exit interview, I was specifically asked if the incident affected my decision to leave, but I lied and said no.

Both B and I were assured during the numerous interviews we had that C would be talked to and “appropriate actions” would be taken against him as they were “not acceptable” and not part of “the culture” of the firm. C is still working there as a partner, though, most likely due to his very large book of business, numerous accolades, etc.

I practice employment law now, and in retrospect, I should have made a huge deal about it, threatened a lawsuit, and took a nice vacation with my settlement proceeds.

# Tips For The Dreaded In-House Self-Evaluation
## Regardless of how you might feel about having to do one, if a self-evaluation is a part of your process then it’s worth doing well.

Not every company asks their employees to write a self-evaluation. But as a law firm associate, I had to write one, and now that I’m in-house, it is a part of my team’s process. If you have never done one before, it can be daunting. But even if you have written a self-evaluation before, it can be a dreaded task, especially if you haven’t prepared. Here are some tips that have worked for me.

Research The Criteria

To evaluate yourself (or anyone for that matter), you need to know what the criteria are. How are you being measured or judged? Is it according to skills developed or results achieved? Is it based on a client satisfaction survey or whether your work aligned with company core values or furthered company goals? How are wins defined by your legal department, quantitative or qualitative? And what does excellence or meeting objectives or not meeting objectives look like? The more clarity you have on the process, the better you are able to prepare. It may also be helpful to have a mentor at your company to ask questions if you are not comfortable going to your manager directly.

Keeping A Done List

A best practice is to keep a running list of what you’ve been working on throughout the year and do your best to update it weekly or monthly, using calendar reminders. The method behind this madness is because it can be even more difficult or extremely time-consuming to try to remember a year’s worth of work at the end of the year, especially when you have a looming deadline to submit a self-evaluation. While it may take some time to create the habit of updating your running “done” list, the list itself doesn’t have to be complicated.

One way this can show up is to have a page in your OneNote or in a Word document where you make a list of all the categories you want to keep track of — trainings, arbitrations, mediations, projects, etc. — and update it periodically. The categories will depend on the criteria as well as the kind of law you practice. My categories as an employment lawyer likely differ from my intellectual property colleagues.

Another way to keep a running list is to take a sheet of paper, divide it into quadrants, and simply jot down what you work on each quarter (fiscal or calendar) in shorthand. This is also helpful to discern at a glance which quarters tend to be busiest for you. Note that your shorthand needs to be descriptive enough that you will remember it a year from now.

If you haven’t done this all year, don’t give up! Go ahead and take the time to review your calendar to create a running list of all the work you’ve done. Then consider grouping the work in ways that make sense for your evaluation.

Know Your Audience

The last tip is to consider your audience. Is it simply your direct manager? If so, do you think they will prefer bullet points that may be easier to read? Or do they need paragraphs written in third person so that those paragraphs can cut and pasted into your company system? Is your audience an entire committee? Do what you can to tailor your self-evaluation to your audience’s need and use case.

Invest The Time

Regardless of how you might feel about having to do a self-evaluation in the first place, if it is a part of your process then it’s worth doing well. Invest the time to create a system that works for you as well as the time to write well. Do what you can to provide specific examples that show how you have been been a value-add.

# Power Niche Marketing: Some Advice On Pitching You Might Not Have Thought Of
## For every pitch, there should be one single goal: making the right impression.

So you have a pitch set up. Now what?  Who should go?  Who should speak?  Who should do what?  How did you get the pitch?  What is the prospective client expecting to hear?  What are the strengths and weaknesses of the people doing the pitch?  What is the one question you really hope the team isn’t asked?

At most law firms, everyone looks at each other awkwardly. No one wants to hurt someone else’s feelings. If Toby is a brilliant lawyer but trips over his tongue at a pitch, maybe he should be keeping his mouth mostly shut — but who is going to tell Toby that?

Or if the big cheese — maybe the managing partner — is going to the pitch, should she dominate the discussion or keep quiet and let others speak to get air time?  And who is going to tell the big cheese what her appropriate role should be?

There is a myriad of questions here and they are all personal to the people going to the pitch and the people who are going to be receiving the pitch.

But there is only one answer: everyone should check their egos at the door in figuring out who should do what. There should only be one single goal and that is making the right impression at the pitch.

This is easy to say — and I just said it — but it is difficult to do if there is an inherent awkwardness within the team in having this type of discussion. Let me delve into this important point.

Patrick Lencioni — in his incredible book, [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](http://amzn.to/2z1zqwc) (affiliate link), puts forth the first dysfunction of a team as lack of “trust.” This doesn’t mean a concern that people will steal. Instead, he means that often Teammate A doesn’t “trust” Teammate B enough to be honest enough to say something like:

“Toby you really aren’t good at these pitches — you just babble too much — I am much better — let me do the talking.”

Yikes — that is awkward to say!  Isn’t it?  You could hurt Toby’s feelings. Yes, you could indeed. You could really upset Toby.

But what is your goal — preserving Toby’s feelings or doing a great pitch and landing a new client?

That is the question for you and your team. Now, what is the answer?

Do you “trust” Toby enough to tell him what he needs to hear and the team needs for success, or are you too afraid of honest confrontation?

Bottom line — teams that don’t “trust” each other enough to be honest about what each teammate is great at and what each teammate is poor at, are a lot less likely to have a successful pitch.

# Survey Results: Remote Working Tech Bridged The Gap During The Pandemic
## In November 2021, it’s clear that remote work is here to stay for the short term, at the very least.

Will law firms become more comfortable with remote working? (Image via Getty)

As the end of 2021 nears, it’s indisputable that the pandemic has ushered in a new era for the legal profession. Lawyers have adopted new technologies into their firms at rates never before seen, and are increasingly relying on technology to ensure newfound business resiliency, productivity, and profitability.

Of course, it’s one thing to make an overarching claim like that, but it’s another thing entirely to back it up with data. Fortunately, there’s a new report that was released yesterday by MyCase that does just that: “[Legal Industry Report 2021: Lessons Learned from the Pandemic.](https://info.mycase.com/industry.html)” (Note I am the Legal Technology Evangelist for MyCase). The survey was conducted in August and September of this year and over 2,000 legal professionals participated.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Earlier this week, my fellow Above the Law colleague [Joe Patrice discussed](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/shocking-no-one-lawyers-who-bother-to-count-find-major-time-savings-in-tech/) how the data from this report established that the new technology adopted by lawyers increased their efficiency and profitability. Today, I’d like to focus on the survey results that show how the technology adopted by lawyers during the pandemic helped to keep law firms afloat despite the many challenges encountered along the way.

Whether it was the shift to remote work, choosing new technology, or implementing and using legal software, the survey results showed that law firms were able to adapt and thrive, all the while managing to provide their clients with the best possible service.

Remote Work Is Here To Stay

First, let’s take a look at the statistics on remote work and the reopening of law firms. According to the survey results, 82% of respondents reported that their firms had fully reopened. For the firms that had not yet reopened, 77% did not yet have plans to reopen. For another 5%, it would take six months or more, and 6% said it would take between four and six months. Finally, the remaining 11% were expected to reopen within one to three months.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When it came to continued remote work, 53% of survey respondents indicated that their firms would allow lawyers and law firm staff to work remotely full-time once the offices reopened, and 70% would allow attorneys and staff to work remotely part-time once reopened.

Change Management Wasn’t As Challenging As Firms Expected

Change is never easy, and for lawyers, it can be even more difficult due to concerns about regulatory and ethical compliance. Therefore, it’s not surprising that 64% of the legal professionals surveyed reported that change management was slightly challenging or extremely challenging for their firms.

The top change management concern reported was cost, with 78% indicating that it was a key challenge. Other change management hurdles that firms encountered included concerns about the ease of software adoption (76%), the lengthy implementation process (75%), data migration (71%), change management and buy-in (56%), and security issues (49%).

However, despite the many change management issues that firms faced, the survey results show that change is possible. As you’ll discover below, many firms were able to successfully add new software to their technology stack, with the end result being increased productivity and profit, ultimately setting firms up for long-term success.

Remote Working Software Usage On The Rise

Respondents also weighed in on their firms’ increased use of remote working software. Nearly half (46%) reported that their firms invested in remote working software as a direct result of the pandemic. This only makes sense since remote working tools were often the only way to get work done due to social distancing requirements.

According to the survey results, the most popular remote-working tools firms invested in due to the pandemic were video conferencing tools (32%), e-signature (22%), law practice management software (14%), time and billing software (13%), and communication software (16%).

Cloud Computing Is Now The Norm In The Legal Profession

Survey respondents were also asked about cloud computing software usage. The data showed that the pandemic had the effect of pushing the vast majority of lawyers into the cloud. Prior to the pandemic, 76% of law firms used cloud-based computing, and that percentage has now increased to 88%.

The firms that transitioned to the cloud since the onset of the pandemic have invested in a number of different types of cloud-based software. The survey results showed that law practice management software was the most popular at 23%, followed by document management software (13%), calendar management software (12%), and credit card online payment tools (12%).

The majority of respondents shared that their investment in cloud-based remote working software has been a favorable one with 73% indicating that the remote working tools their firms invested in had increased productivity. Another 80% reported that remote working tools were part of their firm’s long-term business continuity strategy.

Software Adoption Resulted In Law Firm Profit And Growth

The remote working technologies adopted by law firms during the pandemic not only bridged the gap, but, as discussed above, also increased the productivity and profitability of many firms, laying the groundwork for long-term business resiliency.

Notably, with that increased productivity came increased profit or revenue stability for some firms. According to the survey results, 60% of law firms’ revenue stayed the same or increased in 2020. Additionally, the survey respondents had a favorable outlook on the future, with more than half (59%) expecting their firms’ revenue would increase in 2021.

In November 2021, it’s clear that remote work is here to stay for the short term, at the very least. And, it will most likely become commonplace in the long term as well. This is because the pandemic’s effects pushed many law firms to acquire and implement technology that enables remote working. This technology investment ensures that resilience is built into their firms for the long term. So no matter what happens down the road, their firms will be fully operational despite unforeseen circumstances and are now better prepared for whatever the future may bring.

Are you a lawyer? Someone who hires lawyers? Do you care about the latest trends in Biglaw? If so, you should be listening to [Movers, Shakers & Rainmakers](https://laterallink.libsyn.com/website), a new podcast from Lateral Link. Hosted by [Zach Sandberg](https://laterallink.com/team/zach-sandberg/) and [David Lat](https://davidlat.substack.com/about?sort=about), the podcast provides a coast-to-coast view of what is happening in Biglaw. From major lateral partner moves to intriguing office openings to emerging legal industry trends, the podcast fills you in and lets you know what to expect.

So who are Zach and David, and why should you care what they think?

[Zach Sandberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-sandberg-5642012b/) is a Senior Director based in Lateral Link’s Los Angeles office. He focuses on placing attorneys at premier firms and corporations throughout California and the West Coast. With about a decade of experience in legal recruiting, Zach draws on his wide network of law firm sources to gain insight into the latest Biglaw trends.

[David Lat](https://davidlat.com/) likely needs no introduction. A renowned legal industry writer best known for founding Above The Law, David is an alum of Yale Law School, Wachtell, the Department of Justice, and Lateral Link. His latest project is [Original Jurisdiction](https://davidlat.substack.com/about?sort=about), a Substack newsletter that “aspires to be a source of incisive, fair-minded, and occasionally entertaining commentary about law and the legal profession.” David’s connections within the broader legal industry are second to none.

[](https://laterallink.libsyn.com/website)
A Lateral Link Podcast Hosted by Zach Sandberg and David Lat.

The hosts typically begin with news about notable lateral moves and office openings, then spend the majority of the episode covering a broader industry trend. For example, in the [most recent episode](https://laterallink.libsyn.com/website/episode-5-virtual-law-firm) (Episode 5), Zach and David discuss Davis Polk’s lateral hire of Cleary Gottlieb tax partner Corey Goodman and reflect on the retention challenge for Cleary’s lockstep model, versus Davis Polk’s newly more flexible compensation system. They also address the move of a highly-pedigreed five-partner litigation group from Munger Tolles to Wilson Sonsini and discuss Wilson Sonsoni’s opening of a Salt Lake City office. The majority of the episode is devoted to the growing trend of virtual law firms. Noting that a virtual firm, FisherBroyles, recently entered the AmLaw 200 for the first time, the hosts compare the economics of virtual firms to the traditional Biglaw model. They discuss the type of partner for whom the virtual firm model might be most advantageous, the extent to which virtual firms will appeal to associates, and the outlook for continued virtual firm growth.

In [Episode 4](https://laterallink.libsyn.com/website/influx-of-international-legal-talent-to-the-us), Zach and David cover former Delaware Chancellor Andre Bouchard’s decision to join Paul, Weiss as a litigation partner in the Wilmington office, as well as Crowell & Moring’s office opening in Denver. They also talk about the notable uptick in 2021 of cross-border [lateral hires of international associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/international-lateral-moves/) by U.S. Biglaw offices. The hosts explain what is driving that trend, which countries are most favored for cross-border lateral hires, and whether the American Biglaw market is likely to remain open to international associates in the longer term.

[Movers, Shakers & Rainmakers](https://laterallink.libsyn.com/website) has already addressed several timely topics, including [Biglaw Office Openings](https://laterallink.libsyn.com/website/movers-shakers-rainmakers), the [Attorney Talent War](https://laterallink.libsyn.com/website/episode-2-the-attorney-talent-war), and the [Future of Work](https://laterallink.libsyn.com/website/episode-3-the-future-of-work). But the podcast remains a work in progress, by design. Zach and David are actively soliciting feedback from listeners about the topics they should cover. The goal is for the podcast to be as useful and informative as possible. The target audience is busy, and that’s why the hosts decided an audio format would be best. With a run-time around 30 minutes, the idea is to produce a product that busy lawyers can consume while on the go.

If you have suggestions for topics that [Movers, Shakers & Rainmakers](https://laterallink.libsyn.com/website) should cover, please reach out to Zach Sandberg or David Lat, and let them know what you’d like to hear discussed!

For now, a new edition of [Movers, Shakers & Rainmakers](https://laterallink.libsyn.com/website) is being released every two weeks. If you’d like to be notified when a new episode is available, please [sign up here](https://app.laterallink.com/v1/register/start).

# Yes, Going To Law School During The Great Recession Turned Out To Be A Terrible Idea
## New report confirms 2009-2017 grads screwed themselves/were themselves screwed.

We’re going to quibble about what “good job” means, but the upshot from an AccessLex Institute long-term study on law graduates is that going to law school was a bad call for most people over the past 10 years. Here it is [from the ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/less_than_half_of_recent_law_grads_had_good_jobs_waiting_for_them):

For respondents who graduated from law school during the Great Recession—which the report describes as being from 2009 and 2017—only 44 percent indicated that they had a “good job” waiting for them when they graduated. Of the post-recession graduates, 26 percent said that it took them more than one year to find a good job. Comparatively, only 10 percent pre-recession law graduates said that it took them more than a year to find a good job.

That is a pathetic rate, given the money required to get a law degree. And, speaking of money, the report has some data on that too:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[T]he report notes that for people who graduated from law school between 2010 and 2017, 60 percent borrowed more than $100,000 to pursue their law degree. Among those who graduated between 1990 and 1999, only 26 percent borrowed more than $100,000 for law school. And for those who graduated from law school between 1980 and 1989, 4 percent borrowed more than $100,000 for law school.

That’s where the market for legal education is so out of whack. The problem is not just that the “good” jobs are harder to come by, it’s that law school is wildly more expensive than it used to be. There are maybe 20 schools that are worth paying full price for. There are maybe another 20 schools that are worth it if you are getting reduced, in-state tuition. And that’s being extremely generous.

After that, borrowing over $100,000 to go to law school is just stupid. It’s been demonstrably stupid for going on 10 years now — unless you are going to one of the best schools, or getting a significant discount, or BOTH.

There’s not really anything surprising from the report, but apparently 53 percent of people who graduated during the Great Recession would recommend law school to somebody else. Which, essentially, is why Angie’s List can’t be trusted.

# Small Firm Lawyers Can Miss Out On Connections Formed At Larger Shops
## The social interactions that are available at larger firms are much harder to come by at a small law firm.

When I started [my own law firm](http://www.rothman.law) about five years ago, I knew there would be a number of changes in my work situation. For instance, my pay would vary greatly since I would no longer be receiving a salary from an employer. I also knew that I would have more control over my work situation since I would not have a boss telling me how to perform tasks for clients. However, I did not envision how I would miss out on the types of connections many lawyers make simply by virtue of working in the same workplace as other attorneys and staff.

When I worked at four different shops before starting my own law practice, I always enjoyed meeting new co-workers who had different experiences in the legal profession. The workday goes by a lot quicker when you have someone to talk to, and people at the firms at which I worked would generally stop by each other’s offices every so often to chat. Sure, some people mostly kept to themselves, which was fine. Moreover, if people work from home most of the time, they might miss out on interpersonal interactions with co-workers. However, the vast majority of people at the law firms at which I worked, from file clerks to the managing partners, interacted with other people while in the office, and this had a positive impact on the workday.

During the workday, I would routinely grab lunch with a group of people and bring it back to the office cafeteria so that we could eat together. Throughout the workweek, we would also dash off to coffee shops to pick up treats for ourselves and often for co-workers so that we could take a break from work and engage in something other than the practice of law. This has a positive impact on the workweek too since people are not exclusively in their offices working on client matters and have something to take their minds off of legal tasks.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I also made a bunch of friendships with people I met through work. While working at various shops, I often met up socially with co-workers for drinks or meals in areas that were close to where we all lived. One time, I even organized a reunion of people who worked at a particular shop so that all of us could get together again even though many of us had stopped working there. Co-workers can form an important part of your social circle, and this is a beneficial aspect of working at a larger law firm.

Working with many other attorneys and staff can also yield professional benefits. The people with whom you work are likely to be important references if you decide to move on to new jobs, and may be positioned to give you work depending on where your career paths take you. For instance, I once worked at a large law firm in an office that had several dozen lawyers. Years later, those lawyers were all over the legal industry in the area in which I reside, including government, in-house counsel positions, and in other roles. I know that people have leveraged the fact that we all worked together to have access to so many people who can have a positive career impact.

When you are a solo practitioner or a small firm lawyer, you do not have the same connections with co-workers. For instance, the only other person who works at my law firm at the moment is my brother, and we had a pretty close connection before we started working together! The days can be a little more tedious when you are a small firm lawyer since you do not often have any co-workers to interact with. Moreover, it can be difficult to make career connections that can be beneficial, unless the small firm lawyer commits to bar association events and other networking opportunities to fill this gap.

I am not saying that interacting with co-workers is a substantial reason why people should work for larger firms, and indeed, individuals might prefer working at a smaller shop for many reasons. However, lawyers should keep in mind that smaller law firms have different work environments than larger firms and attorneys might not make the same connections as a small-firm lawyer than they would working at a larger employer.

With widespread access to the COVID-19 vaccine approaching (or [even here for some states](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/what-you-absolutely-positively-need-to-know-about-booking-your-covid-vaccine-appointment-in-new-york/)), it really feels like the tide is turning and the awfulness of 2020+ will shortly be behind us. Another sign of improving times — at least in the legal industry — is the Biglaw COVID appreciation bonuses.

The spring special bonus trend is continuing. Associates at Gibson Dunn (a firm ranked 11th on the most recent Am Law 100 list) got word on Friday afternoon that they, like so many of their peers at other Biglaw firms, would be sharing in their firm’s good fortune during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Gibson Dunn will be handing out bonuses according to the following schedule (April/October payment dates with the second payment larded up):

But the catch is that, except for the brand new associates (class of 2020), the bonus payments are subject to a billable hours requirement. However, if an associate fails to meet that standard for the first payment, they will have the opportunity to make it up in time for the second. The firm also clarified these special bonuses are in addition to the usual year-end money. You can read the firm’s[ full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/gdc-special-bonuses/2/)

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477).

[[How Appealing](http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/010917.html#070082)] * Biglaw faces big challenges today, and even top law firms need to up their game.

Woohoo! The Biglaw spring bonus wars are heating up!

Fresh off of news that [Willkie Farr](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) was handing out special spring bonuses in appreciation of associates’ hard work during a particularly trying period, and[ Davis Polk’s decision](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) to outdo that generosity, Milbank has decided to throw their hat into the ring.

April	September	Total

Bonuses will be paid by April 30 / September 30, 2021.

The full memo is available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/milbank-match-spring-bonus/2/).

The countdown to the end of the year has begun and that means ‘tis the damn season for compensation news! When Milbank raised salaries last month, then Cravath came over the top for midlevel and senior associates, it sparked a flood of firms matching those new compensation numbers.

The latest firm to get on the money train is Foley & Lardner. The firm made over a billion dollars in gross revenue last year — $1,080,332,000, to be precise — and they’re going to share that largesse with associates.

The new compensation grid at the firm is as follows — effective on February 1st:



The firm has maintained its[ tradition](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/foley-lardner-raise-2022/) of paying 2nd years slightly more than the industry average — the Class of 2022 will actually earn $5,000 more at Foley than at Milbank. However, the grid ends at the $420,000/class of 2017 line, where as several firms have placed an extra class or two on the grid.

# You Don't Get To Be At The Top Of The Biglaw Heap Without Getting In On The Associate Raise Trend
## Skadden comes to the party.

The associate raises are coming in fast and furious.

Remember it was way back in January that Milbank made the first move in the 2022 associate salary wars. After *weeks* of (mostly) crickets, yesterday Davis Polk announced their own raises — a match of the Milbank scale for junior associates, but more money for midlevel and senior associates. And now the rest of the market is catching up.

Of course we *knew* that Skadden would pony up the money — the same money that its competitors are handing to associates. After all, the firm is ranked #5 on the Am Law 100 with an impressive $2,662,890,000 in gross revenue in 2020. And with the white-hot lateral market for associates, the pressure will be on for firms to match this standard.

This evening, the firm announced the following compensation scale:



These raises will be retroactive to January 1 — the same [effective date as the Milbank bump ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/)— and will will hit bank accounts on March 15th. You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/skadden-raises-22/2/)

# High-Stakes Litigator Hangs It All Up To Spend Time With His Kids
## Retired at 50. #Goals

Earlier this month Brant Bishop left his practice at Wilkinson Walsh. The litigator, who also spent 18 years as a partner at Kirkland, is not leaving for another lateral opportunity, but just because he wants to spend more time with his family — he has a wife and five kids — saying, “I didn’t leave to go anywhere else except to go home.”

As Bishop [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/01/27/ex-kirkland-wilkinson-walsh-partner-calls-it-quits-to-escape-stress-and-just-go-home/), even when he was on vacation or otherwise away from the office, the demands of his practice — and the constant stream of emails — continued.

“Someone once said the law is a jealous mistress, and I think there’s some truth to that when you’re practicing at a very high level,” Bishop said.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There wasn’t any particular bad experience that prompted Bishop’s decision. It was just the constant grind of elite legal work that made him hit pause on his career:

Bishop said there wasn’t a particular case or client or management responsibility—or a point in his personal life—that prompted his departure. Instead, he chalked up his decision to the inability to stop his work from encroaching on his personal time with his family, as well as the “nature of what we do.”

“It was very difficult to truly be away from the demands of running the firm, doing the management of the firm and doing cases,” Bishop said.

Bishop, who is 50 years old, says he might consider a reentry into the legal field someday:

“I may be too young to be permanently retired, so I don’t know if I’m retired in the sense that I’m not going to find something else to do at some point,” said the 50-year-old Bishop. “But for now the plan is to not really have much of a plan other than to spend time with family and keep my eyes open.”

# Biglaw Firm To Hand Out Year-End AND Special Bonuses -- If Associates Bill Enough

The Biglaw bonus season is revving into high gear as firms are setting out exactly how much they appreciate their associates. Of course, the market standard has pretty much been set — and it includes special bonuses that serve as an extra special tip of the hat for working during the wild ride that was 2020 — so it’s the small differences (like distribution dates and hours requirements) that make the most impact in categorizing a firm’s bonus structure.

On Friday, Kramer Levin announced year-end bonuses that match the prevailing market rate. The bonus scale is as follows ([you can read the full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/kramer-levin-bonuses/2/)):

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Class of 2019: $15,000
Class of 2018: $25,000
Class of 2017: $50,000
Class of 2016: $65,000
Class of 2015: $80,000
Class of 2014: $90,000
Class of 2013+: $100,000

Plus the firm is finally on board with the special bonuses that became all the rage [among Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/?rf=1) starting in the fall, in appreciation of associates‘ hard work during the pandemic. Those special bonuses range from $7,500 to $40,000, depending on class year, and are in addition to the year-end bonus numbers. But there’s a catch.

While year-end bonus eligibility will be given out according to the standard firm criteria, that isn’t the case with special bonuses. The firm says “the special bonus is a one-time award that is designed to reward associates who made the most significant contributions to our clients’ and the firm’s economic success in a challenging year.” As such:

Eligibility to receive a special bonus will be based on an associate reaching a threshold of 1,800 bonus-eligible hours, of which at least 1,600 hours must be time spent on billable matters and/or partner-directed business development (as defined in the Annual Bonus Policy).

It isn’t the most onerous hours requirement out there, but given the challenges of 2020, it’s still a significant chunk of hours to have to bill. And there’s no word on what happens if an associate just misses that threshold.

All bonuses at the firm will be paid on February 15, 2021.

“In disbelief our belief is the reason for all this / The tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling.” – [Kendrick Lamar](http://genius.com/8766061)

This month, [Vault.com ](http://vault.com/)and [The Minority Corporate Counsel Association](http://www.mcca.com/) (MCCA) released their annual Vault/MCCA Law Firm Diversity Survey ([mcca.vault.com](http://mcca.vault.com)), the legal industry’s most comprehensive tool for measuring law firm diversity, collecting data on race, ethnicity, gender, GLBT identity, and disability status. The annual survey collects data based on the previous calendar year. Approximately 250 law firms participate in the survey each year, representing virtually all of the AmLaw 100 and a majority of the NLJ 250.

According to this year’s [report](http://www.mcca.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&pageid=2624), despite progress in recruitment of diverse attorneys, problems at law firms persist concerning attrition and promotion. Here are some other highlights from their annual survey:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
- The diversification of law firms continues at a slow pace, as minority lawyers now represent 15.0% of attorneys at surveyed firms, compared to 13.8% in 2007.
- The hiring of African-American attorneys and law students has declined as their attrition has increased, resulting in law firms employing fewer black lawyers than they did eight years ago.
- Alongside the increased recruitment of minority attorneys, however, lawyers of color continue to leave their firms at a disproportionate rate.
- Moreover, advances among individual minority groups remain uneven, as the number of black lawyers declines and Asian American attorneys experience slower rates of promotion.
- Latina and Asian-American female partners are less than 1% of all law firm partners.
- Although Hispanic lawyers have made the most consistent advances, the number of Latino attorneys, relative to Latinos’ representation in the overall U.S. population, remains far lower than that of other minority groups.
After the [2009 economic crisis](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/what-could-disrupt-diversity-in-law-the-economy-stupid/), widespread layoffs caused women and minorities in law firms to decline for the [first time since the 1990s](http://www.nalp.org/2010lawfirmdiversity). According to NALP, “lawyer layoffs [disproportionately affected](http://www.nalp.org/2010lawfirmdiversity) junior and mid-level associate ranks, and because these groups of lawyers were among the most diverse in law firms, it is likely that these layoffs contributed in significant measure to the lower overall percentages that we [saw] in 2010.”

In 2010, the American Bar Association (ABA) highlighted a study that revealed [25% of law firms](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/about_25_of_law_firms_are_to_blame_for_high_minority_attrition_numbers_stud) are to blame for high minority attrition numbers. [Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/11/diversity-issues-to-consider-before-you-accept-your-offer/) also covered these findings. In this month’s ABA cover story, [“Minority Women are Disappearing from BigLaw and Here’s Why,”](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/minority_women_are_disappearing_from_biglaw_and_heres_why/) Liane Jackson notes that 85% of minority female attorneys in the U.S. will quit large firms within seven years of starting their practice.

In [Joan Williams’s](http://www.uchastings.edu/academics/faculty/facultybios/williams/) study [“Double Jeopardy? – Gender Bias Against Women of Color in Science,”](http://www.uchastings.edu/news/articles/2015/01/double-jeopardy-report.pdf) her team interviewed 60 women of color in STEM. In the study, 100% of women of color experienced gender bias. In addition to gender bias, “Women of color also encounter racial and ethnic stereotypes, putting them in [‘a double jeopardy.’](http://fortune.com/2015/01/26/study-100-of-women-of-color-in-stem-experience-bias/)” Do [women of color](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/double-jeopardy-gender-bias-against-women-of-color-in-the-legal-profession/) face the same ‘double jeopardy’ problem in our profession?

We’ll see how things go if he’s already been fired by President Trump by the time oral arguments roll around. [[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/13/politics/rod-rosenstein-supreme-court/index.html)]

* According to Senate Republican Cory Gardner of Colorado, now that he’s struck a deal with President Trump that will undercut Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s recission of the Cole memo, he’ll be happy to puff-puff-pass votes on all of the Department of Justice nominees he’s been holding up.

# Another Top Biglaw Firm's Ransomware Attack Shows The Importance Of Cybersecurity

When people think of legal movies, they usually think of [Legally Blonde](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/legally_blonde) or [My Cousin Vinny](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/my_cousin_vinny). But times are changing — they’d be better served if they thought about [Blackhat](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blackhat). Attorney-client privilege does wonders when an adverse party wants to compel you to disclose information, but it doesn’t do much in the face of key loggers. Cyber attacks are a real threat to firm security, and even large firms like Quinn Emanuel need to be wary of them. From [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/quinn-emanuel-reports-cyber-attack-involving-limited-client-data-2023-07-24/):

An electronic discovery vendor for U.S. law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan suffered a cybersecurity attack that may have exposed client information, the firm disclosed to California authorities on Friday.

Quinn Emanuel confirmed to Reuters on Monday that “a third-party data center we use for document management for some of our clients became the victim of a ransomware attack” last year. It said the attack was “limited to a small portion of our clients and matters.”

As fortunate as it is that only a small portion of clients and matters were hit in the ransomware attack, none is always preferable. The list of Biglaw firms that have been hit by hackers looks like a who’s who of the industry: Jones Day, Gibson Dunn, Orrick, and others. Will your firm be the next to join the list? If you want to avoid that, your best bet would be to bolster your cybersecurity during the “just in case” phase rather than the “why didn’t we just factor it into overhead” one. Your clients and your PR team will thank you.

# Embracing Uncertainty In The AI Landscape
## With AI, as with driving, it's best to slow down in uncertain conditions.
By [Olga V. Mack](https://abovethelaw.com/author/olgamack/)

Shares[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/embracing-uncertainty-in-the-ai-landscape/&text=Embracing%20Uncertainty%20In%20The%20AI%20Landscape)[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/embracing-uncertainty-in-the-ai-landscape/&display=popup&ref=plugin&src=share_button)[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/embracing-uncertainty-in-the-ai-landscape/)[](javascript:void(""#ea-share-count-email""))
Back in my teenage years, my dad was my favorite chauffeur. And chauffeur he did, all through high school, college, and even law school. Fast forward to my wedding day, when my dad told my soon-to-be husband about his new chauffeur duties. 

Instead, my new husband urged me to get my driver’s license. After one driving lesson together, it was clear I’d need a professional instructor — to keep us safe on the road and to keep our newlywed bliss intact.

During a lesson, speeding around a curve under the blinding sun, my instructor said, “You have skills and a knack for risk. But remember, it’s best to slow down in uncertain conditions.”

That is also fantastic advice for approaching AI. Recent advancements in AI are thrilling! But in today’s rapidly changing landscape, caution is essential, especially as we are still figuring out legal policies, procedures, and best practices. 

Many questions still need to be answered. We’re not even sure we know all the right questions yet. But to make the most informed decisions now, it helps to first become comfortable with our uncertainty. Let’s look at how to embrace and navigate this inevitable aspect of the AI landscape. 

Education: The First Line Of Defense Against Uncertainty

As AI technology advances, new challenges and risks emerge. Issues regarding privacy, security, bias, and ethical implications arise. You must understand the cause-and-effect relationships of these risks to develop effective mitigation strategies. 

Stay updated on AI technology developments to navigate uncertainty. Consider these [Ongoing AI Education Strategies and Resources for Lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/ongoing-ai-education-strategies-and-resources-for-lawyers/). Attend conferences, read research papers, and follow industry experts and thought leaders on social media. Learn how the latest AI developments can potentially impact various industries and society as a whole. 

As you incorporate new information into your practice, you learn to better adapt to the evolving AI landscape and identify the challenges ahead. Over time, you prepare to proactively address those challenges head-on.

Focus On Policy Questions First

As AI evolves, policymakers face the challenge of creating regulations that balance the unrelenting demand for fast innovation with the necessary deference to ethical concerns such as fairness, transparency, accountability, and inclusivity.

One of the best ways to understand AI is to initially focus on the current policy questions and concerns surrounding its implementation. When you actively follow and participate in discussions around policy-making, you can personally contribute to shaping the future of responsible AI. Groups actively tracking or engaging in policy processes now include: 

- [MIT Task Force on the Responsible Use of Generative AI for Law](https://law.mit.edu/ai)
- [Center for AI and Digital Policy](https://www.caidp.org)
- [AI Now Institute](https://ainowinstitute.org/our-work)
Start Small In Low-Risk Areas

Experiment with AI technologies in controlled environments and pilot projects to gain practical experience. Start small in a low-risk area to ramp up the excitement while minimizing potential negative impacts. Through this approach, you learn from your mistakes and can refine strategies before implementing them more broadly. 

Balancing Your Approach To AI

Skepticism complements open-mindedness when facing uncertainty in the AI landscape. While many race to embrace the potential benefits of AI, business leaders depend on lawyers to critically evaluate its limitations and potential risks. In maintaining a balanced approach, you can help companies make more informed decisions and avoid unquestioningly adopting inappropriate AI tools. 

While we’re all in the driver’s seat and at the starting position, let’s embrace the unknowns of AI together and explore the exciting possibilities it holds. By staying curious, informed, and adaptable, we can confidently navigate the intersection of AI and law and make the most of what AI offers.

# Am Law Top 20 Firm Announces... Raises? It's Hard To Tell From This Announcement

We’ve had firms announce raises, we’ve had firms [preach caution](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/one-firm-decides-to-pump-the-brakes-on-this-whole-raise-thing/), we’ve had firms preach caution and then [realize which way the wind blows](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-changes-course-on-associate-compensation/), and we’ve had firms try [to clumsily pull off radio silence](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/these-partners-desperately-dont-want-us-to-know-they-arent-raising-salaries/). Now we have a complete mixed bag — akin to what we heard [from K&L Gates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-biglaw-behemoths-weak-sauce-raise/) yesterday.

Honestly, we had given up hope on Greenberg Traurig. First, we got reports out of some of its smaller market offices that the partners considered raises and opted against them. Then even tipsters in New York expressed gloom and doom at the prospect of raises:

We received an email this morning that there will be an associates meeting with managing partners this afternoon to discuss “important issues.”

Wouldn’t be surprised if they say no and are trying to deal with optics.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But this afternoon we’ve learned that Greenberg Traurig matched the $180K salary for its New York first years. The raises are effective July 1. The firm declined to issue a memo and opted to inform associates directly in an office meeting.

Beyond that though, associates are at the whim of the firm’s black box policy of determining pay based on productivity, group needs, etc. Tipsters seem pretty confident that this is the firm’s way of claiming matching status without really matching. As we hear more from individual associates we’ll get a clearer picture, but early reactions suggest they expect to be shortchanged compared to their peers going forward.

In an [earlier post on leverage](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dont-just-shame-firms-based-on-profits-per-partner-consider-leverage/), I raised Greenberg Traurig as a firm whose leverage may be an obstacle in the raise process. One tipster took issue with this, noting that Greenberg maintains tiers of partnership that all have varying levels of equity, while the reported figures reflect only those partners on the top rung. In other words, the figures artificially inflate the associate to partner ratio. And that’s fair… but it still means the people with the most equity to lose heavily outnumber the associates. So while 4.4:1 may be high, this is still a leveraged firm.

And this just might be how a leveraged firm splits the baby, with raises only where they were absolutely necessary — first-year associates in the New York office — giving a little to the NYC mid-levels and seniors, and then nothing everywhere else.

As of this moment we’ve only been hearing of $180K raises in New York office and affirmative statements of “no raise” in other markets. As this story develops with news from other offices, we’ll update.

UPDATE (6/21/16 5:01 p.m.): We’ve now heard from Chicago:

GT Chicago to $180,000. No announcement as to when. No announcement as to Summers. Individual raises communicated individually.

Sounds basically in line with NYC.

UPDATE (6/21/16 4:37 p.m.): An associate in another non-NYC office notes:

No official announcement has been made or will be made…. It’s not been communicated to us when or if those decisions will be coming but lots of anxious/potentially unhappy folks here.

It seems gloom and doom really is the default setting for GT associates.

# Gigantic Biglaw Salaries Are Making Associates Reconsider Taking Pay Cuts To Go In-House
## Those in-house pastures aren't quite as green anymore.

The reality from where I sit as a recruiter is that when we approach in-house candidates with great opportunities, they often stop listening once they find out it could be a 30-50% pay cut.

— Legal search consultant Stacy Humphries of the Pye Legal Group in Houston, Texas, explaining how the latest [Biglaw salary wars](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/) have [impacted in-house recruiting](https://www.law.com/2022/01/31/big-law-salary-war-throws-cold-water-on-in-house-recruiting/). “It’s not good for big firm lawyers who won’t have as many in-house options available to them or will have to work hard to convince companies that they sincerely want to go in-house and will stay,” Humphries wrote in a [popular LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6889979145292537856/). “These salary wars are not good. Change my mind.”

# Biglaw Partners Give Back To Community With Tremendous Results
## They're out there making history.

Great things happen when Biglaw gives back. That’s the big takeaway from a feel good story out of Los Angeles. But before we get to all the good news, some background.

It was back in 2008 when three Biglaw partners decided they wanted to share the benefits they experienced from policy debate with traditionally underserved communities. [Henry Weissmann](https://www.mto.com/lawyers/Henry-Weissmann), a litigation partner at Munger Tolles & Olson; [Bart Williams](https://www.proskauer.com/professionals/bart-williams) a Proskauer litigation partner; and the late [Sandra Seville-Jones](https://www.mto.com/lawyers/Sandra-A-Seville-Jones), who was the longest tenured managing partner at Munger Tolles, knew one another from their high school debate days, but when they looked around they saw that the high school debate circuit had been decimated by years of budget cuts. So, working with the National Association of Urban Debate Leagues, they put their heads together to create the Los Angeles Metropolitan Debate League (LAMDL).

Weissmann told me that policy debate changed his life, and by establishing LAMDL they wanted to make a difference in the lives of students. Not only that, but the trio saw an opportunity to increase diversity in the legal profession, as the pipeline between debate and the law has always been a strong one. And Weissman notes the skills learned in policy debate directly translate to lawyering, including the close reading and analysis of research, argumentation skills, and learning complex issues from multiple viewpoints. Something I personally can attest to (indeed, [three out of the four Above the Law editors have policy debate experience](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/the-undebatable-qualifications-of-ketanji-brown-jackson/)). Oh, and Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor agrees.

And[ research ](https://www.citigroup.com/citi/foundation/data/naudl-the-debate-impact.pdf)bears that out — academic achievement is enhanced for participants in policy debate to a statistically significant degree. Seriously, the benefits of debate are staggering — it [closes the achievement gap](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22633913/), increases [college readiness](https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/communities-and-banking/2013/spring/closing-the-academic-divide-through-debate.aspx), and high school students who participate in debate are three times more likely to graduate from high school than those who do not. And those impressive stats have held up here — since 2010, every LAMDL senior who went through the program graduated on time, and went on to either college at a two-year or four-year school, a local trade school, or into national service.

So, you can see this is an incredibly valuable program. And it’s also successful. LAMDL executive director Michael Cirelli shared that for the first time in the program’s history, they’ve qualified a team for the über prestigious [Tournament of Champions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_of_Champions_(debate)) The ToC is held every year at the University of Kentucky, and this year Andrew Subingsubing and Jokim Bryant of Harbor Teachers Prep Academy will be participating!

Jokim and Andrew received their SECOND TOC bid! They're LAMDL's very first team to qualify for the TOC; here's to making history, team! [pic.twitter.com/ogO8ZfXCZL](https://t.co/ogO8ZfXCZL)

The team earned the last leg of their bid to the ToC at the UC Berkeley Invitational via a quarterfinals appearing and a 5-1 preliminary record. The debaters began their year strong, but then experienced some setbacks, falling short of earning the last piece of the their bid at several tournaments before the success at Berkeley. As Cirelli noted, their persistence and hard work really paid off. And, Subingsubing will continue his debate career at Northwestern where he received a debate scholarship (Bryant is still a junior).

In addition to the contributions of individuals in the legal profession —[ seriously, the board of directors is just littered with attorneys](https://www.lamdl.org/who-we-are/Board) — LAMDL receives contributions from a number of Biglaw firms: Munger Tolles & Olson, O’Melveny & Meyers, MSK LLP, Loeb & Loeb, and Jenner & Block. They also have an internship program in partnership with Proskauer Rose.

And the LAMDL continues to grow. Despite the challenges of COVID, the league has actually grown the number of schools participating. Cirelli says, in terms of the amount of schools involved, they’ve only scratched the surface.

# Crypto Hypocrisy
## We should not expect corporate America, even those with a 'green' ethos, to manage their addiction to speculative finance.

Crypto mining is hurting our ability to combat climate change and its impacts. Meanwhile, investors, including those that market themselves as part of a green future, have ignored crypto’s growing carbon footprint. Unsurprisingly, the lack of government oversight has also let the crypto industry grow without any meaningful guidance. And now, as the crypto community’s upcoming Crypto Climate Accord evinces, the slow pace of government and its inattentive policymakers have led to serious climate costs that we are already paying for.

Bitcoin, which uses a “proof of work” mechanism, is a dirty business. According to the [Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance](https://cbeci.org/) (CCAF), if Bitcoin were a country, its estimated electricity consumption would be comparable to the Netherlands, New Zealand, or Argentina. Unfortunately, all signs like the rising value of tokens indicate that Bitcoin will use even greater energy over the next few years. As the CCAF’s Michel Rauchs [explained](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952), “It is really by design that Bitcoin consumes that much electricity. This is not something that will change in the future unless the Bitcoin price is going to significantly go down.”

The crypto community, however, asserts that energy use is not necessarily bad. The community [argues](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/05/bitcoin-btc-surge-renews-worries-about-its-massive-carbon-footprint.html), for example, that sending and storing emails also uses tremendous energy. But the community’s counterargument misses the obvious point, that email communication has a value to society at large while crypto, as of now, does not.

Tellingly, crypto’s climate costs have not deterred investors who have rushed to capitalize on the pivot to ESG investments and finance green businesses. Recently, Tesla, which has built a brand on zero-emission cars, [purchased](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1point5-billion-in-bitcoin.html) Bitcoins for its corporate treasury. Venmo, the popular payment transfer app, will now [allow](https://www.reuters.com/technology/paypals-venmo-launches-crypto-buying-selling-2021-04-20/) its customers to buy cryptocurrencies on its platform. We should not expect corporate America, even those with a “green” ethos, to manage their addiction to speculative finance.

Just as we did not trust Exxon to regulate itself, we should not trust the crypto community. The [Crypto Climate Accord](https://cryptoclimate.org/), which describes itself as “inspired by the Paris Climate Agreement,” is a private sector-led initiative focused on decarbonizing the cryptocurrency industry. The accord aspires to enable all of the world’s crypto technologies with 100% renewables. In a world where we still must compete for renewable energy, governments, not the crypto community, should decide whether we want to prioritize renewables for powering cities or for mining more bitcoins.

# The Tragedy Of The Law Firm Commons

“All I’m saying is, when we split the check three ways, the steak-eater picks the pocket of the salad man.”

Hank Azaria uttered this pearl of wisdom in the 1999 movie [Mystery Men](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystery_men), a bizarre but occasionally funny movie that mocked Hollywood superhero flicks. Twenty years ago, I thought this was just a laugh line in a mediocre movie. Today, I see it as an illustration of one of the basic paradoxes of law firm management: efficient overhead allocation.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
On average, overhead at an Am Law 200 law firm can run anywhere from $150-250K per lawyer. When you consider that our work product is generally advice, phone calls, and PDFs, many of the greater public are stunned that it can cost so much to create so little of tangible, concrete value.

Those of us in the industry know it’s not that simple. Generating those PDFs takes substantial human capital, which is just about the most expensive resource there is. The three biggest costs for most law firms are (1) salaries, (2) rent, and (3) employee benefits. Keeping human beings employed, housed, and healthy isn’t cheap, which is surely part of the reason for the expansion of [virtual law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/virtual-is-the-new-boutique/).

But there’s more to it. Everyone agrees that overhead should be reduced as much as possible, yet year after year, most firms see their overhead creeping upward. Spend items are notorious for sticking around once they’ve earned a spot in the budget. Why do we keep seeing this pattern emerge year after year?

I believe a large part can be attributed to a destructive intersection between business efficiency and a classic human foible.

The Tragedy of the Commons

Imagine you’re a 19th century English farmer with a herd of sheep that need to graze. There’s a large parcel of public land (also known as “common land”) where you’re allowed to graze your sheep as much as you like. This is great! You get fat sheep for basically no cost.

Unfortunately, you have neighbors, and they have neighbors, and they all have herds they need to graze. You notice that there’s less and less grass available when you drive your herd over. So you start getting more aggressive, feeding your animals on the public land longer and more often, leaving less for your competitors. Again, you’re getting the benefit, but the public as a whole is bearing the cost. But then your neighbors start doing the same thing, and before anyone knows it, the whole patch of common land has been overgrazed and rendered barren.

More generally, the [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) illustrates that when individuals derive personal benefit by imposing an expense on a large, distributed population, rational economic decision makers are usually going to try to extract the maximum benefit possible, even if it causes immense damage to the population as a whole. In short, we divorce costs and benefits at our peril. If we want to create or preserve public resources, we have to ensure we have smart controls in place to counteract those basic human instincts.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The problem this poses for law firms is that the basic reality of managing hundreds of employees is that, to some degree, we have to divorce costs and benefits.

We can’t track and allocate overhead perfectly without going to gross extremes of oversight and management. Imagine a law firm that tracked every single item of overhead used by every attorney and employee in the company. Every staple would have to be catalogued and paid for by the attorney responsible for using it in proportion to the total expense and usage of staples for the year. This system would be fair, but deeply wasteful of the resources thrown at tracking so many items so closely. No large firm can afford this kind of administrative nightmare.

At some point, law firms just have to agree to divide overhead expenses up without regard to who’s actually getting the most benefit of that expense. It’s more cost-effective to not care about who used how many staples than it is to try to track and allocate them accurately. We sacrifice accuracy for utility.

Many firms take this conclusion all the way, and introduce a uniform overhead split across all attorneys, regardless of actual usage, and the Tragedy of the Commons begins anew. In a system like this in a 10-attorney firm, every dollar of overhead you spend only costs you a dime. In Biglaw, you’re paying fractions of a penny. The rational attorney starts demanding more assistants, marketing support, business development dollars, office space, computers, associates, hard-copy treatises, CLE, free lunches, coffee — more, more, more! And so does every other attorney in the building. Costs are divorced from benefits, attorneys divorced from reality, and overhead spirals.

Getting Smart

So what’s the rational middle ground? It’s getting smart about picking and choosing which overhead to allocate and which to divvy up pro rata. If the added cost of leaving an overhead item unallocated is less than the cost of tracking and allocating accurately, then we call it a win. Leaving office supplies unallocated is going to lead to some amount of employee abuse of the system, but not enough to justify tracking and allocation of anything but the most expensive items.

Harder issues abound, though. Many clients will no longer pay for Westlaw searches. Who pays for them in the firm? If Westlaw searches are divided up pro rata through the firm, without regard to who’s generating those search charges, litigators will rejoice and search to their heart’s content, driving up costs while the transactional lawyers despair and grumble. That seems unfair, so how much is it going to cost to track and allocate those charges? Who takes the overhead hit? Do the charges accrue against the overhead of the associate doing the search, the mid-level who assigned them the project, or the partner who bills out the file? Does a transactional attorney who might need access, but doesn’t end up making any searches in a year, need to share the burden as well to pay for the option of doing some research if they need it?

How about the cost of real estate? Does the attorney with the bigger office pay more overhead than the one with the smaller office? How about if the smaller office has a better view and more windows? Is conference room usage part of the equation? The professional mediator who uses 3-5 conference rooms a day is going to love splitting that rent pro rata with the attorneys who never take meetings in the office.

The answers aren’t simple, and the solution isn’t easy. It requires management sitting down, combing through expense items in detail, and putting in the work to decide what to allocate and what to leave as a common good.

The straight pro-rata overhead split is an invitation to abuse, mistrust, and creeping costs that can hamper or sink even the biggest firms. Every firm looking to compete in the modern legal market needs to focus on finding smart, efficient ways to track and allocate overhead that won’t create war or unnecessary divisiveness.

Better and Richer

Despite our reputations, attorneys are people, and people respond to incentives. Handled correctly, smart overhead allocation can cut costs, increase profits, and create healthier firm morale. Don’t think of it as a chore; think of it as an opportunity to make your firm a fairer, more vibrant place to work. Who doesn’t want to get both better and richer at the same time?

# The Legal Profession's Sisyphus Is Getting Really Tired
## How long will it take before the profession looks like society at large?

Do you know the [myth of Sisyphus?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus) He keeps pushing a rock up a mountain only to have it fall back when he gets it to the top. It’s like the legal profession with diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Very slow progress up that mountain. Hopefully, unlike Sisyphus, DEI will scale the mountain and stay there, but it won’t happen any time soon.

One of the issues that the profession faces is diversity, or lack thereof, in its ranks. The State Bar of California has published its “[Report Card on the Diversity in California’s Legal Profession](https://publications.calbar.ca.gov/2022-diversity-report-card/).” The report looks at California’s lawyer population in 2022 and arrives at some not-so-surprising conclusions.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Despite a “minority majority population in the state, the attorney population still does not reflect the state’s diversity, with Latinos as “particularly underrepresented.” However, the report acknowledges that the proportion of attorneys who are women and people of color has increased.

Who represents the largest group of newly admitted attorneys? Women of color. Yay!

Since approximately 80% of California attorneys work in the private sector, the report says that “increasing the diversity in this sector alone will have a transformative impact on the profession.” We all know that it’s still mainly the men who are running law firms in the state, although that is changing (but not fast enough). Every law firm that promotes a woman to running the firm deserves kudos for recognizing that women are just as capable as men, if not more so. In fact, it was Liz Cheney, in her [recent remarks at the Reagan Presidential Library](https://www.businessinsider.com/liz-cheney-men-running-the-world-not-going-that-well-reagan-library-2022-6) who pointed out that men haven’t done such a good job of running things.

It’s no surprise that women are overrepresented in government and nonprofit sectors. Do you think that it could have anything at all to do with how difficult it is for women to generate the necessary business to move forward in the law firms? Just asking.

Another unsurprising factoid: women of color are underrepresented in leadership positions in all employment settings. Add to that the unsurprising fact that nonbinary attorneys “consistently report the lowest level of satisfaction with workplace experiences.”

What are the most desired areas for improvement? No surprise there either. Compensation and benefits. That’s true for everyone.

How to increase satisfaction for minority lawyers across the board? Professional development, a topic not touched on in law school. The State Bar’s report concludes that “women, nonbinary, attorneys of color LGBTQIA+ attorneys, attorneys with disabilities, veterans, and attorneys working in nonprofit settings rank professional development resources and support as the second highest area of the workplace that would need to increase for their satisfaction to increase.”

These groups should not be merely ATMs for partners, but if they are to be future partners and firm leaders, then firms need to spend time helping them develop their own books of business or take over existing clients when senior lawyers retire. Without business development, firms languish or even die. Clients want to know who is handling their matters; introductions and inclusion are important.

Increasing DEI is a slog. In law firms, the percentage of attorneys of color is inching close to 20%, but the percentage of partners of color lags at just under 12%. Better than it has been, but still nothing to be excited about. That’s one of the problems with incrementalism; [it takes so long to see results](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/a-look-at-the-legal-professions-continued-diversity-efforts/). How long will it take before the profession looks like society at large? I’ll be taking a dirt nap.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The report suggests steps that employers can take, but again, there’s nothing new: promote transparency and accountability, build an inclusive workplace culture, retain, advance, compensate and empower staff. The recommendation for attorneys? “Empower yourself and others.” Easier said than done.

Whither the Mansfield Rule? The rule, aimed to diversify law firm leadership, has just brought forth [Mansfield 6.0](https://www.diversitylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Mansfield-Rule-6.0-Evolution-Participating-Firms-Press-Release-Final-for-Release-8-16-22.pdf) and it increases the requirements for Mansfield certification. Here is the latest iteration:

“[T]he 6.0 version requires law firms to consider at least 30% historically underrepresented lawyers from all four groups (women lawyers and underrepresented racial and ethnic lawyers, LGBTQ+ lawyers and lawyers with disabilities) when appointing to leadership roles and promoting into the equity partnership, among a dozen other activities that focus on the path to leadership. Firms must also consider 30% underrepresented talent for C-suite roles. Firms are asked to share lessons learned with each other through monthly knowledge sharing forums. They must create and publish job descriptions for leadership roles. They must continue to meet routine check-in, data-collection, and reporting milestones.”

Clients want and are now demanding diverse attorneys working on their matter, as [this exchange on Fishbowl](https://www.fishbowlapp.com/post/the-specialized-in-house-legal-team-we-work-with-loves-our-work-however-our-entire-firm-was-just-terminated-by-the-client?origin=https:%2F%2Fjoinfishbowl.com%2Fpost_47zzw8zbao&og_title=Post%20from%20a%20Fishbowl%20user&og_description=The%20specialized%20in-house%20legal%20team%20we%20work%20with%20l&og_image=https:%2F%2Ffiles.getfishbowl.com%2Fcontent_preview_images%2Fthe-specialized-in-house-legal-team-we-work-with-loves-our-work-however-our-entire-firm-was-just-terminated-by-the-client.png&isPrivateFeed=false&emailDigestPost=false&sig=INgq_1G8elxvAfJN1xfHe0DJA0IfO47H1Kh8M9rHxJA&u=60e62e10595fc4002a9272bd&t_ev=1&_branch_match_id=1012551465593289354&utm_source=email&utm_campaign=bowl_digest&utm_medium=industry_bowl_digest&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXz8rPzEvLLM5Iyi%2FP0UvOz9UvyC8uiTcxr6oqt6hKSsy3L7U1M0g1M0o1NDC1NE1LNjEwMEq0NDI3SkpRK4lPLbM1BABCT7qqSgAAAA%3D%3D) shows. Read the entire thread; it’s eye-opening for those who don’t think that diversity matters in law firm selection. It does now and that requirement will only increase. It’s no longer a matter of lip service.

And please don’t use the class of incoming SCOTUS clerks as any sort of DEI model to emulate. This class is 84% white; contrast that with law students, who are a much more diverse cohort. So, what does that percentage say about this Supreme Court? Probably [nothing that hasn’t already been said](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/supreme-court-clerks-showcase-the-only-diversity-that-doesnt-matter/). Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson will undoubtedly mix it up going forward. I can’t wait.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

It’s Friday, [so despite our pleas](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/dont-announce-your-bonuses-on-a-friday/), we fully expect Biglaw firms to go around announcing special bonuses.

Consistent with this trend, Morrison & Foerster has announced their own special bonuses for hardworking associates. As you’d expect from a firm ranked 32nd in the Am Law 100 ranking with $1,147,200,000 in 2019 gross revenue, they’re matching the prevailing market rate set by Davis Polk.

The firm’s bonus payment schedule is as follows:

As you can see, the firm is going with June and December payments that are backloaded. Associates will have to meet the firm’s standard billable hours requirement on an annualized basis to qualify, but if they miss the hours for the June payment they can make it up for the second payment. And, as you’d expect, the firm confirmed these special bonuses are in addition to the typical year-end bonus pool.

You can read the firm’s[ full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/mofo-special-bonuses/2/)

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Bonuses, Delayed Raises During Salary War
## Good news coupled with exasperating news. Way to go!

Yes, it’s 2022, and yes, there’s a new Biglaw salary scale in town that was [announced by Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) last month, but let’s not forget that some firms still haven’t announced their 2021 year-end bonuses yet.

Bracewell — a firm that brought in $295,000,000 gross revenue in 2020, ranking it at No. 113 in the most recent Am Law 200 — is one of them.

Today, the firm announced its bonuses, and even though associates had to wait for the cash, they’re probably pretty happy about their Cravath and Davis Polk matches. But what about a Milbank salary match? Ehhh… we’ll get to that.

Bonuses at Bracewell come with a billable requirement of 2000 hours, but they also give discretionary bonuses of 15% of market for those who are billing at 2200 or more hours. Check out the firm’s compensation table:



So, what’s going on with base salaries at Bracewell? Associates can apparently hurry up and wait. According to a source, the management committee is “monitoring market developments” like oh so many other firms, but will match whatever the prevailing salary is once the market has settled.

Congratulations to everyone on the generous bonuses, and pre-congratulations on your future Milbank (or Cravath or Davis Polk?) salary matches!

# Lawyers Do Good (Really)

As I write this, I’m a little worn out from all the good I’ve been doing lately. You might ask, have you been feeding the needy? No way, runners like to eat, there’s never anything left over. [Planting trees?](https://www.arborday.org/) Um, that would mean leaving the office. Teaching underprivileged kids? I don’t know how interested they would be in venture capital or securities law. No, I don’t have time for any of that. I’ve been doing good as a lawyer, that’s what I’ve been doing.

Lawyers do good work. Take any particular transaction: Someone has to draft the contract. Someone has to negotiate it, and then someone else later has to interpret it, and then there may be a need for additional people to ensure both sides comply with the contract. Whoever fills these roles has to be smart, able to stay sharp — or at least awake — while reading dense texts (unless it’s one of my contracts, which hum along like a Hemingway novel), and be able to recognize any legal ramifications coming out of the deal.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

That’s our role. It’s good. (And yes, we should be compensated appropriately, because really, not everyone can do this.) To the extent you can, see your work as good. The day goes by faster, and the sun shines a bit brighter when I know I’m doing good — which is just about every day at work. (My weekends are for doing [bad](http://www.amc.com/shows/breaking-bad). If you consider [napping on the sofa](http://www.estelia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/classic_comic_02-3.jpg) bad.) I’m reminded of [Bill Clinton talking about private equity](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/31/bill-clinton-bain-capital_n_1561208.html), that he didn’t “think that we ought to get into the position where we say this is bad work. This is good work.” Of course, people went bananas because he said a non-hateful thing about someone on the other side, but he had a point, and as lawyers, we shouldn’t have to look too hard to see the good in what we’re doing.

I’m not talking about pro bono. Say you do pro bono 20% of the time. (A high figure in Biglaw, or any law, really.) If you hate what you’re doing the other 80%, you’re probably not going to be a fount of joviality. You don’t need pro bono to feel good about your job. (And not every pro bono client is an angel, a fact the junior attorneys out there will soon find out.)

The better balance is to have the 80% represent work you feel good about. You should be able to grind through the other 20% of your work life (e.g., evicting elderly ladies, negotiating Kanye West media appearances, etc.).

One thing that’s helped me is that in SmallLaw, it’s easier to see the fruits of my labors. Sometimes I’ll email a client something like a convertible note and less than two minutes later, I’m copied on the client’s email sending the note out to the portfolio company. Whereas in Biglaw, I’d draft something for Morgan Stanley or someone like that and it’d go up the food chain at the law firm until someone said it was okay to send over, and then over at Morgan it’d go up their food chain, and days later it would finally go out. It wasn’t quite the same.

In SmallLaw, if you want you can even confine yourself to only taking clearly sympathetic “good” clients like, I guess maybe nuns or community organizers, and then you could enjoy living in your cramped studio apartment and eating PB&Js for lunch everyday. Maybe if you want to upgrade to a one-bedroom one day, and maybe splurge on an occasional pizza, you could expand your definition of what “good” is to include everyday people or everyday businesses that you can help save money on taxes or have a more efficient corporate structure so they can hire more people or reward their current employers or shareholders.

Even if you’re still stuck in Biglaw, there are plenty of opportunities to see your work as good. Think about when [GM sued NBC](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/10/us/nbc-settles-truck-crash-lawsuit-saying-test-was-inappropriate.html). NBC had strapped explosives on the side of a GM car, sideswiped the car on a Dateline episode, triggering the explosives, and then told the audience the resulting explosion was because of a problem with the car. I bet the Biglaw attorneys who worked on that complaint felt they were doing good.

So go forth, and do good.

# Law Firms Should Keep Attorney Reviews Confidential
## It benefits no one to let a criticized staffer see who made the criticism.

Most law firms have an annual (at least) review process wherein attorneys and managers reflect on a lawyer’s work in the preceding year and determine points for improvement. This usually involves an attorney writing a self-review, typically in response to a series of questions posed by managers at a law firm. Then, attorneys often sit with their managers to review what the lawyer wrote in the self-review and to also review the observations that management had about the lawyer. Since attorney reviews usually involve the exchange of sensitive information, law firms should try to keep details of the exchange during the review process confidential to the fullest extent practical.

I had to complete an attorney review process at three of the four law firms at which I worked before starting my own shop around five years ago. Generally, I thought that the attorney review process was a waste of time. Everyone reviewed had a vested interest in discussing only positive things about the attorney’s performance in the preceding year so that they could optimize their chance of receiving a raise or a bonus. Moreover, the law firms at which I worked never took suggestions seriously, so it was usually best to stay quiet about feedback which could improve the firm.

At some of the shops at which I worked, the attorney self-review asked for comments concerning other lawyers with whom an attorney worked and feedback about management at the firm. I generally did not feel comfortable providing such feedback. If I was too honest with my feedback, I could come off as being somewhat abrasive toward others at the firm. Sometimes, I just wrote “N/A” or something similar in these sections of self-reviews so that I could try to skirt the responsibility.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
One time, I did write a comment about a junior partner at a shop at which I worked. I thought that his management style could use some improvement since he had a tendency to micromanage and give artificial deadlines that were not related to any of the hard deadlines in a case. I did not expect that this junior partner would participate in the attorney evaluation process or read my self-review. The managing partner of the office seemed to be the only partner in charge of the review process, and he sent and received all of the emails related to annual attorney reviews. Regardless, it seemed obvious that given the sensitive nature of my self-review, it should not be shared with anyone who was mentioned in the document.

When it was time for me to meet with the managing partner about my review, I was peeved when I saw the junior partner I discussed in my self-review in the office with the managing partner. It was clear that this junior partner had printed out and fully read my entire self-review, including the comments about his own management style. Some might think I should have known that the information related to the attorney review would be shared among the partners at the firm, but I really did not think this was the case. It definitely felt like the managing partner had violated my trust by not keeping my comments in confidence, and this made it more difficult to be transparent during the attorney review process.

To be clear, certain aspects of the attorney review process should not be kept confidential. For instance, people should widely discuss how much money they are paid in salary and bonus, since this can help everyone advocate for more compensation and could shed light on illicit pay disparities at a firm. In addition, if people are made promises during reviews about the length of time it might take to be promoted or about other career advancement details, it might benefit others to know this information so that people can compare notes.

However, it should go without saying that if one person provides negative feedback about another individual at a law firm in good faith during the attorney review process, this should be kept confidential. It is important that people be permitted to provide candid and frank feedback during attorney reviews so that attorneys and their managers can improve. Moreover, leaking confidential information shared during the attorney review process can violate the trust that employees put in management at law firms which can have a negative impact on morale.

Christ, we need to send Haiti some building codes man.

Lost in the shuffle over Donald Trump’s comments that certain non-white immigrants come from [“shithole countries”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-protections-for-immigrants-from-shithole-countries-in-oval-office-meeting/2018/01/11/bfc0725c-f711-11e7-91af-31ac729add94_story.html?utm_term=.741a35949c90) was the fact that Trump was revoking “temporary protected status” for thousands of people living in America.

One of those allegedly s-hole countries was Haiti. Trump has allegedly said that everybody in Haiti has AIDS.

I know that this is a very difficult legal concept for Trump supporters to understand, but “we all know that non-white people are worse than white people” is NOT a sufficient legal grounds for new law. Having the “guts” to spew racist stereotypes is NOT a legally sound basis for policy. Trump can say whatever he wants, but his statements are evidence towards the intent of his policies. If his statements are racist, you CAN infer that his policies are meant to be racist, and RACISM IS NOT A JUSTIFICATION FOR LAW.

What it is is “arbitrary and capricious,” and that is exactly what Trump is being sued for now.

A group of Haitian plaintiffs, represented by lawyers from [The National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild ](https://www.nationalimmigrationproject.org/pr/2018_14Mar_tps-haiti.html)and a few Biglaw attorneys from [Mayer Brow](https://www.mayerbrown.com/)n working pro-bono, have asked for an injunction to stop Trump’s revocation of TPS. The group claims 50,000 Haitians, along with their 27,000 children, would be affected. They filed in the Eastern District of New York.

… And they don’t all have AIDS.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As with so many legal actions against Trump, at the heart of the complaint are the president’s own words:

57. After his election, President Trump continued to voice his animus toward immigrants of color and Haitians in particular. In June 2017, during a meeting in the Oval Office with then-DHS Secretary Kelly and Secretary of State Tillerson, President Trump reacted to a document listing how many immigrants had received visas to enter the U.S. in 2017. Upon learning that 15,000 Haitian people had received such visas, President Trump stated they “all have AIDS.” During that same meeting, President Trump also learned that 40,000 immigrants from Nigeria had received visas to enter the U.S. in 2017. He reacted by stating that, once they had seen the U.S., these Nigerian immigrants would never go back to their “huts” in Africa.

58. On January 11, 2018, during a White House meeting with several U.S. Senators, the President disparaged a draft immigration plan that protected people from Haiti, El Salvador, and some African countries, asking “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” President Trump further denigrated Haitians, asking “Why do we need more Haitians?” and ordered the bill’s drafters to “take them out.” In this meeting, the President further expressed his preference for more immigrants from places like Norway, where the population is more than 90 percent white. Haiti’s population, by contrast, is over 95 percent Black.

Again, the concept here is that having a preference for immigrants based on race is an arbitrary policy.

But there is another legal angle here that Trump supporters don’t seem to get that his lawsuit attacks head on. Trumpsters are nothing if not “literalists.” They see what is directly in front of their face, and almost nothing else. The Earth? “Looks flat to me.” Racial stereotypes are wrong? “Why are there so many black people in the NBA then?” Consent? “She doesn’t have any bruises on her face.”

Temporary protected status? “Exactly, TEMPORARY.”

The earthquake that sent so many Haitians heading to our shores happened in 2010. In Trumpworld, Haitians should no longer need to stay here because… well, they don’t have any kind of knowledge about how long it takes a poor nation to recover from a natural disaster, but 2010 sounds like a long time ago so it’s time for them to go.

The complaint explains that Haiti has not recovered, and DHS considered none of this when implementing Trump’s “eww AIDS” strategy:

93. Reviews of country conditions in Haiti made in the weeks prior to the November 20, 2017 decision to terminate TPS demonstrate that the country continues to experience the extraordinary and temporary conditions for which Haiti was designated for TPS in 2010 and re-designated for TPS in 2011. The conditions include:

(i) internal displacement: More than 37,000 people remain in IDP camps, with tens of thousands more displaced but not recorded in official statistics due to lack of tracking or reclassification;
(ii) a housing and physical infrastructure crisis: many people who left camps settled in equally inadequate homes, many of which were damaged by the earthquake and have not been repaired. For example, upwards of 200,000 live in Canaan, a makeshift, informal settlement created shortly after the earthquake whose inhabitants lack access to basic services — including water, health care, and waste management one of the world’s worst cholera epidemics;
(iv) grave hunger and malnutrition, with more than one million people facing severe food insecurity, greatly exacerbated by the massive destruction of crops, livestock, and infrastructure in Haiti’s southern peninsula by Hurricane Matthew in October 2016;
(v) political instability and security risks, including the risk of gender-based violence. The United Nations Peacekeeping force played an important role in stabilizing Haiti. Its replacement with a smaller force has generated concern that Haiti lacks necessary police presence. Nearly one quarter of police supervisory positions remain unfilled, and the police have a presence in fewer than half of Haiti’s 570 communal sections; and
(vi) a widening fiscal deficit, with economic growth slowing to one percent and public expenditures on the rise to meet post-Matthew reconstruction needs.

Ironically, it is the slow process of earthquake recovery — that Trump reduces to mere s***hole status — that proves Trump’s decision to revoke TPS status was done more out of racial animus than any fact-based assessment of the situation.

So far, courts have been pretty strong in telling Trump that racism isn’t a sufficient basis for immigration policy. I don’t expect the E.D.N.Y and eventually the Second Circuit to buck that trend.

In the meantime, Haitians living in America just have to keep hanging in there. I remember asking my Dad how he was handling Trump’s election. He said, “M’ap viv, t’cheri” — roughly “I’m still alive, honey.”

In the early days of the pandemic, associates were most concerned about job security and cost-cutting measures, [according to a 2020 survey](https://info.abovethelaw.com/2020-mla/atl-law-firm-associate-survey-report) conducted in partnership with our friends at Major Lindsey & Africa. 

One year later, we’re curious to learn about younger lawyers’ goals, priorities, and views of law firm culture. 

We are running a series of (always) quick surveys intended to capture the viewpoint of younger lawyers and help determine what may — or may not — differentiate them.

In this year’s Millennial Lawyers’ Survey, we examine how associates — and, increasingly, of counsel and partners — of this generation define their goals, priorities, and workplace culture. 

Please take a couple of minutes and share your thoughts at the links below. (And please note we are not exclusively interested in hearing from millennials; lawyers of all ages are encouraged to take the survey!)

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

[A recent lawsuit ](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/fox-news-gets-employment-discrimination-suit-to-go-with-1-6b-dominion-defamation-suit/)filed by Fox News producer Abby Grossberg contains allegations that network attorneys, including outside counsel from what Biglaw firm, encouraged Grossberg to give “evasive” testimony in Fox’s litigation with Dominion Voting Systems?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Hint: The complaint further alleges Grossberg was discouraged from getting her own attorney by Fox’s Biglaw attorney, who said that “only ‘complicates’ the process and ‘slows things down.’”

After Milbank matched last year’s holiday bonus schedule — “matched” assuming you ignore the summer bonuses from last year — we [aggregated some of the best associate commentary about the new bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/biglaws-reactions-to-same-bank-bonuses/). One irritated tipster objected to the mundane bonuses by pointing out that the firm had raised rates this year and arguing that bonuses should have gone up accordingly and anything else is just profit taking by the partners off the backs of the associates:

They increased rates by 4% this year, so comp should go up, not down.

The next firms down the line should know they are going to get ravaged by the legal rags if they just match when the partners get millions while the workhorses don’t even get a cost of living increase.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I’m not so sure this tracks. In his reaction column, Elie Mystal argued that firms are gearing up for the next recession though he questioned whether any firm is going to stay its hand at layoff time based on cheaping out now. If partners are just pocketing the extra revenue, then the answer is emphatically no, they will not let this deter them from future layoffs.

But partners may not be pocketing this extra money. As we also covered yesterday, [many Biglaw firms have been holding on to more revenue and adding it to partner capital contributions](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/law-firms-trying-not-to-go-bankrupt-this-next-recession/). In other words, that money could in fact be going into the rainy day fund that will keep the firm paying its bills — to both vendors and associates and staff — when times get tough.

There’s also an argument to be had that the salary hike last year — also initiated by Milbank — was a bridge too far under the existing finances. It’s not that the market couldn’t bear the increase, because obviously it could, but whether that increase was shouldered by decreasing partner profits or passing it on to the clients was an open question. You can guess how that was ultimately resolved. And despite the caterwauling of those clients, they continued to dutifully pay because the only thing worse than paying more for legal services is having to explain a devastating loss by admitting the legal department was trying to cut corners on counsel.

The retort to this is that if true, why were summer bonuses on the table last year and not this year? Remember Milbank wasn’t originally on the summer bonus train — that was Simpson’s contribution to the cause.

Finally, boosting rack rates doesn’t necessarily mean the firm’s billing out at that rate. Biglaw billing is wrought with discounts to make clients feel special. Is a 4 percent rate increase really bringing in 4 percent more scratch? Probably not. Milbank’s revenue is — if Am Law numbers are to be taken as gospel — up about 12 percent, but headcount is also up roughly 6 percent. And, of course, they raised the salaries in the meantime.

The point is, it’s possible that bumping rates should result in a bonus increase, but it’s certainly not automatic. There’s a little more involved in running a firm than that.

# LGBTQ In Biglaw: Advice For Law Firms And For Job Seekers

Two weeks ago, the American Lawyer reported that Goodwin Procter promoted Biglaw’s first openly transgender partner, [Blake Liggio](http://www.goodwinlaw.com/professionals/l/liggio-blake).[[1]](#_ftn1) The story was inspiring, and highlighted in detail how the firm supported Blake’s transition. In my estimation, both Blake and Goodwin deserve major congratulations for sharing this story. Biglaw firms can learn from this experience, as the handling of LGBTQ issues should be a focus in their recruiting efforts, both on-campus and through lateral hiring. Can law firms improve here? I believe so – let’s examine how.

2017 Best Law Firms for LGBTQ Individuals

Many law firms have put diversity and inclusion at the top of their agenda for 2017.

Attracting a diverse talent pool is important for law firms, as a diverse roster of attorneys better serves clients by providing a wide range of backgrounds, ideas and beliefs.

It is no secret that some law firms are better at attracting LGBTQ candidates than others. Due to the emphasis law firms have put on creating a diverse environment, Vault has created a special set of rankings. Vault’s “diversity rankings are based on each firm’s associates’ rankings of how the firm does at creating, maintaining, and fostering a diverse workforce. [Their] diversity rankings include separate categories for diversity as it relates to minorities, women, LGBT individuals, individuals with disabilities, and military veterans. To determine our Best 25 Law Firms for Diversity, [Vault] used a formula that weighs the five categories evenly for an overall diversity ranking.” [[2]](#_ftn2)

The top five firms for LGTBQ attorneys according to the Vault rankings are as follows:

- Ropes and Gray LLP[[3]](#_ftn3)
- Jenner & Block LLP[[4]](#_ftn4)
- Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP[[5]](#_ftn5)
- O’Melveny & Myers LLP[[6]](#_ftn6)
- Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP[[7]](#_ftn7)
What Can a Law Firm Do to Attract LGBTQ Candidates?

There are certain indicators an attorney can look for to determine if a firm is proactive in promoting an inclusive LGBTQ environment. The National Association for Law Placement (“NALP”) has outlined a number of strategies for law firms in the recruitment and retention of LGBTQ attorneys. Here are a few things a firm can do and that candidates should look for: [[8]](#_ftn8)

- Is the firm a member of the National Lesbian and Gay Law Association and/or affiliate organizations?
- Does the firm engage in and openly publish information relating to pro bono work and services for the LGBT community?
- Does the firm include LGBT lawyers, or lawyers sensitive to issues facing LGBT lawyers, on hiring committees and in all aspects of the hiring process to promote a more sensitive and fair process?
- Does the firm highlight the issues on their firm website, including Equal Employment Opportunity policies, domestic partner benefit policies, and employee resource group (affinity group) information?
- How does the firm celebrate Pride Month?
LGBTQ Attorneys in Biglaw

According to NALP statistics, “the overall percentage of openly lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender lawyers reported in the NALP Directory of Legal Employers (NDLE) in 2016 increased by a small amount to 2.48% compared with 2.34% in 2015.”[[9]](#_ftn9) The following chart, from the NALP Diversity Directory, provides a good metric for the number of LGBTQ attorneys practicing in Biglaw (click to enlarge):

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Openly-LGBT-lawyers.png)

Law Firms Lead the Pack

There has been a rise of reported LGBTQ lawyers practicing in Biglaw, and if the NALP data from the last ten years is any indication, this trend will continue. Despite the increase, Biglaw is not perfect – more can be done.

The legal industry has been well recognized as one of the best professions for LGBTQ individuals. According to the Corporate Equality Index (CEI) from the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), of the 200 largest law firms (by revenue), 112 firms compiled a perfect score.[[10]](#_ftn10) A score is based on a web-based survey sent from the HRC, who gathers information and data on employers’ business practices as it relates to LGBTQ issues. According to the HRC:

A team of researchers investigates and cross-checks the policies and practices of the rated businesses and the implications of those policies and practices for LGBT workers, including any connections with organizations that engage in anti-LGBT activities. Employers are not rated until all appropriate information has been gathered and verified to the extent possible.

[[11]](#_ftn11)

Banking and Financial Services came in second with 69 perfect scores, followed by the Retail and Consumer Products industry, with 38 companies compiling a perfect score.

Recommendations For Candidates

Although the legal profession leads the pack, it is still not perfect in this regard – there is often room for improvement. Here are a few things that firms can do to meet a candidate’s needs.

- Ask the firm to provide mentors to LGBTQ attorneys.
- Ask the firm to provide more firm-wide training and education on the issues affecting LGBTQ attorneys.
- Ensure that firms are using correct terminology, which promotes a more inclusive environment, on all firm-wide publications.
For LGBTQ candidates interested in making a lateral move, ensure that the firm you select is supportive in meeting your needs. Selecting a culture of acceptance and inclusion will be instrumental in your success as an attorney.

Ask Questions During the Recruitment Process

A firm’s policy on discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity can be the single most important issue facing an LGBTQ candidate. It is important to ask the tough questions in an interview and gather as much insight as possible when choosing a firm.

Laterals are encouraged to ask the tough questions about diversity and inclusion in the interview process. Firms should ensure their interviewers are well versed in all issues that may be vital to the candidate. Passing off questions about diversity to other partners or committees illustrates a lack of commitment to the issue.

Resources for LGBTQ Lawyers

There are a number of organizations and events catered to LGBTQ lawyers. Listed below are some of my recommendations:

- National Lesbian and Gay Law Association: The LGBT Bar hosts an annual conference. This year it’s being held on August 2-4, 2017, in San Francisco. .[[12]](#_ftn12) Both law students and lawyers are encouraged to attend.
- Many state and city bar associations have local LGBTQ committees. For instance, in NYC there is the LGBT Bar Association of Greater New York. I suggest checking with your local bar association to see if there is an LGBT committee in your area.
- NALP has an LGBT Section and is active in promoting topics of nondiscriminatory hiring and retention of LGBTQ lawyers at their annual NALP Conference.
Every LGBTQ attorney should feel safe and fully integrated in their firm. I highly recommend joining a committee or an organizing with other LGBTQ attorneys and allies. When choosing a firm, it might be helpful to seek guidance from a recruiter who knows what questions to ask and has the inside scoop on firms relating to LGBTQ issues. No firm is perfect, so be sure to use all resources available to you to make an informed decision.

# Magic Circle Firm Defers Partner Compensation, Delays Bonus Payments, And More
## Magic Circle firms are also feeling the pinch.

The thing about pandemics is, well, that they’re everywhere. That’s the whole “pan” part. Global law firms have unique challenges that impact the way they’re dealing with COVID-19 and the economic upheaval surrounding it.

Magic Circle firm Clifford Chance, which is the 7th largest in the world under the Global 200 index, is joining the COVID-19 austerity measures. So [what is Clifford Chance doing](https://www.law.com/2020/04/21/clifford-chance-defers-partner-distributions-in-virus-response-292-65630/)? They’re deferring global partner distributions, salary reviews and raises are frozen, and while bonuses will be paid, the timing of said payments may be delayed. The good news is that the firm is not currently planning on any layoffs or furloughs.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The firm made the following statement about their cost-cutting measures:

“We are a strong and resilient organisation, with over five years of robust global growth behind us. Our teams are always a source of huge pride, they are fantastically talented, motivated and collaborative, and never more so since the virus has begun to spread.

Over the coming months our aim is to keep these teams together and to work shoulder to shoulder with our clients who need our support now more than ever.”

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# We Finally, Really, May Be Nearing The End Of The Dewey & LeBoeuf Case
## It's been going on longer than the firm at this point.

If you loved the end of Lord of the Rings — where all the action was resolved but it kept going for 45 minutes anyway — then you must love the tale of Dewey & LeBoeuf, the short-lived Biglaw merger that crumbled in the face of the Great Recession. The recriminations have long outlived the firm’s entire run as an entity, featuring a rare firm bankruptcy and some dubious criminal prosecutions. Now, after eight years, the last piece of ongoing Dewey drama may be coming to a close.

In [a Friday letter](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/gdpzyonobvw/SEC%20v%20Davis%20et%20al%20-%20Sanders%20settlement%20offer.pdf), the SEC informed Judge Valerie Caproni that it has agreed in principle to a settlement agreement with former Dewey & LeBoeuf CFO Joel Sanders. The SEC says the proposed settlement awaits approval by the Commission and expects to have a final answer for the judge in six to eight weeks.

This comes on the heels of the [new short documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0p-pMHwusw) featuring the former head of the merged entity, Steven Davis, [offering his take](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/lets-all-watch-dewey-leboeuf-burn-again/) on the crisis that felled the firm.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Sanders was the only Dewey & LeBoeuf executive convicted in the Manhattan DA’s questionable prosecution of firm leadership. After hyping up the idea that the firm lied to investors about the firm’s financial position, the DA ultimately dropped claims against Steven Davis and lost the case against the firm’s executive director, Stephen DiCarmine. Sanders earned a million dollar fine.

But the SEC’s desire for a pound of flesh isn’t tempered by state law fines so it’s been going after Sanders ever since. But maybe we’ve finally reached the end.

So, as much as I hate to write it, we’ll close on the obligatory: Dewey think this is the end of the case?

# Guy Tries To Marry His Computer -- AGAIN -- As Stupid Anti-Marriage Equality Protest
## Porn addict protests marriage equality in the stupidest way imaginable. And this isn't the first time he's tried this stunt.

It’s been a couple of years since we had to write about Vandy Law grad Chris Sevier, and he decided to remedy that with another ridiculous bit of prosanity: [suing for the right to marry his laptop](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/guy-tries-to-marry-his-computer-again-as-stupid-marriage-equality-protest/2/) in Texas. If that sounds familiar, it’s because he did the [exact same thing](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/05/apple-porn-guy-wants-to-marry-his-porn-filled-computer-lets-all-laugh-at-his-motion/) in the Florida marriage equality fight.

Apparently the media is astounded at the absurdity of this (as seen [here](http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/19/man-wants-to-marry-his-macbook-to-protest-same-sex-marriage-5827405/) or [here](https://www.rawstory.com/2016/04/accused-stalker-trying-to-undo-same-sex-marriage-by-suing-for-right-to-marry-his-prn-filled-computer/) or [here](http://uproxx.com/webculture/chris-sevier-suing-texas-laptop-same-sex-marriage-laptop/)). Welcome aboard the Chris Sevier train! Wait until they hear about the time he [sued Obama over Duck Dynasty](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/apple-porn-guy-sues-obama-for-firing-duck-dynasty-guy/).

We started covering Chris back when he was just a boy, standing in front of a computer, asking it [why he’s so addicted to porn](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/07/lawyer-apple-should-protect-me-from-my-porn-addiction/). Those were such innocent days for the now-serial litigant. Since then he’s matured into a diehard opponent of marriage equality by demanding the right to marry his computer. Looks like someone’s just looking to trade in his spouse for a newer model in a couple years!

In any event, Sevier’s stupid protest — which has rolled through Florida and Utah — has hit Texas, and Governor Greg “[I hate dildos](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/ted-cruz-is-no-fan-of-dildos/)” Abbott and Attorney General Ken “I [got my own](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/texas-attorney-general-slapped-with-three-felony-counts/) ongoing [legal problems](http://www.statesman.com/news/news/feds-accuse-ag-ken-paxton-of-fraud/nq3xR/)” Paxton are not happy for the help. Despite hating the thought of same-sex marriage, the two archconservatives are eager to rid the courts of this sideshow. You’d almost think Sevier was working some high-level irony by exposing the absurdity of those who claim Obergefell opened the door to marrying inanimate objects, but nope! He’s [either serious](http://www.houstonpress.com/news/man-thinks-he-can-reverse-same-sex-marriage-by-fighting-to-marry-his-laptop-8328641) or in character so deep that Daniel Day-Lewis is like, “dude, take it down a notch.”

“[This lawsuit] is not a matter of who’s on the right side of history,” Sevier said. “This is about who is on the right side of reality. Are we just delusional?”

“We” aren’t, no. But we may know someone who is…

(If you want to read the last non-pornographic thing to come out of Sevier’s computer, it’s on the next page…)

* Many law school deans are opposed to the ABA’s proposal to require 75 percent of graduates sitting for a bar exam to pass it within two years, but this is perhaps one of the more absurd arguments offered against the rule: “Nobody looks at what percentage of Ph.D.s end up as college professors, or what percentage of M.B.A.s achieve their goal.” [[Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/law-school-accreditors-raising-the-bar-1479751011)]

* Unlike what has happened in the past with certain of President-elect Donald Trump’s personal and business settlements, the Trump Foundation will not be paying for any part of the $25 million settlement in the Trump University fraud class-action case. Trump will happily take the tax deduction instead. [[DealBook / New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/business/dealbook/trump-foundation-wont-pay-any-of-25-million-university-settlement.html?ref=dealbook)]

* According to Erica Moeser, president of the NCBE, there’s been a slight uptick in bar exam scores across the country. “The big picture item is that we have looked for scores to continue to drop, and they didn’t,” said Moeser, who now seems to have a glass-half-full perspective on the state of bar exam passage rates in America. [[ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/some_states_see_increase_in_state_bar_pass_rates_while_others_witness_decli)]

* In case you didn’t recall, there will be a retrial for Stephen DiCarmine and Joel Sanders, the former executive director and former chief financial officer of failed firm Dewey & LeBoeuf, and the judge on the case says it could be “as long or longer” than their first trial, which ended in a mistrial. Dewey care anymore? [[New York Law Journal](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202772843046/Dewey-Retrial-May-Take-Longer-Than-The-First?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=1&curpage=ALL)]

* Kirk Nurmi, the lawyer who defended Jodi Arias through two trials, has agreed to be disbarred rather than face an ethics hearing for writing a book about the case prior to the completion of his client’s appeal of her life sentence. Nurmi wrote the book for “self-enrichment,” but he’d already made $1.3 million for defending Arias.

For Biglaw’s corporate clients, business travel is set to permanently remain below pre-pandemic levels, and travel for internal meetings will see the deepest cuts. 

[That’s according to a Bloomberg survey](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-08-31/will-business-travel-come-back-data-show-air-hotel-travel-forever-changed) of 45 large businesses, which found that 84% plan to cut their travel budgets after the pandemic, with most of these seeing reductions of 20%-40%. 

While executives told Bloomberg they will still shell out for travel for important business development efforts, they also noted that other travel will be even more closely reviewed. 

As the CEO of Europe’s biggest paint maker put it: “Trips to drum up business could drop by a third, and internal meetings by even more.”

It seems that one judge ruled that Doe need not be unmasked and may continue to use a pseudonym in her action against the firm, and another judge ordered that notes from Doe's mediation with the firm be preserved, as she claims that a fellow partner allegedly threatened to fire her because of her complaints while there.
