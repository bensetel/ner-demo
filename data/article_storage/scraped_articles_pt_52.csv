# Associate Compensation War Comes To Texas
## Another Biglaw firm responds to the salary wars.

Yeehaw! The 2021 salary increases have made their way to the Lone Star state. Today, Vinson & Elkins announced to associates they were increasing salaries to the new Davis Polk compensation scale.

The firm dropped the welcome news in a Zoom meeting, not via a memo. But tipsters reports it is a match of the Davis Polk scale, effective July 1. An insider describes the announcement:

The newly elected firm leadership at Vinson & Elkins had an introductory meeting for associates this morning, scheduled before the new salary announcements at other firms last week. During the meeting, they announced V&E would match the Davis Polk numbers….. it hasn’t gone out in writing yet. But the announcement was made, new salaries effective July 1.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s unsurprising that V&E made the move on associate salaries; the firm made 782,352,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 59th on the Am Law 100. Nice to see them sharing the largesse with associates.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

“Oh, I see! You were just joking about how I can’t work because I have children. Hilarious!”

If I hear a comment that comes off as sexist, I’ll flip it on its head and serve it back that way, so the person who stated it hears how it sounds. Humor works for me because it helps me to be more objective about it instead of being mired in my frustrations.

— [Jenny Ecklund](http://www.tklaw.com/jennifer-ecklund/), a partner in Thompson & Knight’s Dallas office, explaining how she uses humor to [overcome unconscious gender bias against women](https://bol.bna.com/5-women-on-how-to-climb-the-big-law-ladder/) in the law firm setting. Big Law Business interviewed four other partners for their takes on how to “climb the Biglaw ladder” as a woman.

Management is probably genuinely trying to give associates more flexibility with their vacations but [ultimately freaking out their lawyers in the process](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/shearman-vacation-policy/). Meanwhile, summer associates are heading to work and very [worried about the level of mentoring they’re going to get](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/what-summer-associates-are-saying-about-the-2021-program/) in a remote work environment. And we check in on a judge at the center of an [epic set of allegations](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/well-this-judge-seems-like-a-real-frickin-delight/).

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I would not be surprised to see more announcements of that sort.

— Owen Burman, managing director of the Wells Fargo legal specialty group, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-law-attorney-billing-rate-at-15-year-low-wells-fargo-says) on the likelihood of more associate layoffs happening this year, thanks to historically low billable rates. The latest Wells Fargo report notes that in the first quarter, lawyers at some of the largest U.S. law firms billed at an annual pace of less than 1,600 hours, which is the lowest figure has been in about 15 years. According to Burman, an annual billable rate that low is “not something firms have historically accommodated.”

# Axiom’s War On Biglaw
## Axiom’s IPO application foreshadows problems for Biglaw.

Axiom’s war on Biglaw continues, and this time it’s making a move that Biglaw cannot, by definition, respond to.

Axiom, the alternative legal services provider founded in 2000, has been on a tear in recent years. Its most recently reported revenues, from 2017, came in at $300M for the year, about the same as an Am Law 150 firm. It has over 1,300 attorneys on staff, global reach, and high-powered clients eager for alternatives to traditional, pricey Biglaw. Axiom’s success has been [one more example](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/why-innovation-dies-in-law-firms/) of how smartly deployed 21st-Century technology has allowed small startups to rocket to the top of well-established industries in relatively little time.

Late last month, Axiom dropped a potentially game-changing bombshell. The alternative legal services provider recently [applied for an IPO](https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2019/02/19/alternative-legal-services-provider-axiom-applies-for-ipo-397-16977/) in the U.S. We don’t know yet the terms of the IPO, or where the stock will be listed, or really much of anything other than the fact that an IPO is on the menu. What we do know is that Axiom is looking to turbocharge its growth, which has already been explosive for several years.

We’ve Got Stock, But No Options

For leadership of law firms that Axiom is competing with, this development is equal parts terrifying and frustrating. It’s terrifying in that the IPO threatens more growth by one of the companies that has been aggressively eating into what was traditionally a law-firm-only pool of work. And it’s frustrating because U.S.-based law firms have no equivalent countermeasures.

[As I’ve discussed in this space previously](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/dropping-a-bomb-on-the-legal-monopoly/), one of the major economic and organizational hurdles that law firms of today face is the ethical bar on ownership of firms by non-lawyers. The ethical rules are there with noble intention: we want to ensure that the biggest decisionmakers and stakeholders impacting our clients and their cases are all bound by the ethical rules that govern our profession.

There’s a healthy debate to be had over whether this aspiration is worth the limits it places on law firm development. In practice, it means law firm management is often composed of attorneys with limited or no organizational management training. It further limits the pool of non-attorney managers that law firms can turn towards, since law firms can’t offer equity in the company, as would be offered to most high-end management candidates. When you self-impose limits on the ways you can pay your staff, you self-impose limits on the quality of that staff.

Shark Tank vs. Loan Sharks

As we’re now seeing with Axiom, the problem isn’t just limited to limiting how law firms attract and compensate their managers. The problem extends to how those firms finance their growth.

Growth takes cash, and IPOs are a great way to get cash. Take a successful company on a winning streak, offer to allow the public to buy a piece of equity, then take that investment money and grow the company further. In an ideal world the company makes money, the investors make money, and everyone ends up happy. That’s exactly what Axiom is hoping it can pull off, and it’s free to do so since it’s not a law firm.

Law firms don’t have this same luxury, which is one more reason why news of this IPO is so disheartening. For the same reason we can’t give equity in our firms to potential managers, we can’t sell equity to the non-JD-having public at large through an IPO. If a law firm wants to finance growth, its only options are to do so out of its own pocket or to take out a large loan.

Growing out of one’s own pocket is a fine goal, but it generally requires major sacrifices to income and stability that most law firm partners aren’t eager to take on. Plus, many projects will just be too expensive to self-finance. In those instances, law firms are left seeking gigantic business loans. Unlike IPOs, loans have to be repaid, on time and with interest tacked on. If a company that went IPO experiences slower-than-expected growth, its investors will grumble, but have little to no recourse. If a law firm’s loan-financed expansion doesn’t pan out, the firm and its partners may find themselves in serious legal jeopardy.

In short, Axiom gets to go on Shark Tank. Biglaw gets to see the loan shark.

A Business Model That Belongs In A Museum

Biglaw is in a tough spot right now. Most large firms have barely finished clawing their way back to where they were prior to the Great Recession, despite roughly a decade of overall economic expansion in the U.S. Our customers are increasingly looking to decrease their spend with us, whether by dragging work back in house, or resorting to alternative providers such as Axiom or the [Big 4 accounting firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/king-kong-is-coming-to-crush-your-practice-with-a-calculator/). Work is increasingly funneling to either the absolute tip-top of the market, or to niche, commoditized boutiques, leaving a middle market that’s struggling to survive.

Axiom’s IPO should be read as both a warning sign and a wake-up call. In this environment, we need every tool and every innovation possible at our disposal to make our century-old business model relevant again.

Relaxing the rules on law firm ownership by non-attorneys seems as good a place to start as any. The UK has been experimenting with publicly owned and traded law firms for several years at this point, and the sky has yet to fall. There surely must be a way to allow firms to grant equity stakes in themselves while still insulating the legal decision-making from their non-attorney owners. Until we recognize that, we’re bringing a knife to a gun fight. [If you’ve seen Indiana Jones, you know how that turns out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKrmDLvijo).

Biglaw has lost ground to Axiom and its kind for the last two decades. We imposed the ethical rules on ourselves to protect both the public at large and the industry’s reputation. If those same ethical rules allow our space to become dominated by non-attorneys who aren’t bound by them, are they not doing more harm than good?

The time to move is now. Axiom isn’t waiting, so why should we?

With a [New York Times exposé](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html/), a [scathing SNL skit](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/snl-alec-baldwin-bill-oreilly), and a metric ton of advertisers [running for the hills](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/free-market-does-what-the-court-system-could-not-hurt-bill-oreilly/), it’s certainly not the best of times for Bill O’Reilly. If you start to lose the trust of [dick pills and reverse mortgages](http://fusion.net/the-long-lucrative-right-wing-grift-is-blowing-up-in-t-1793944216), you’ve truly lost America.

And now the Times reports that 21st Century Fox has [escalated O’Reilly’s alleged antics to a Biglaw investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/09/business/media/fox-bill-oreilly-harassment-claim.html?_r=0), with Paul, Weiss coming on board to investigate at least one of the sexual harassment allegations against the host.[[1]](#f1) As the host himself might ask, what the heck just happened?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It appears the hubris of O’Reilly and his network got the better of them this time. In response to O’Reilly’s recent negative publicity, Fox assured the media that they thoroughly investigate every complaint made to their anonymous hotline, but both Fox and O’Reilly were quick to note that no current or former Fox employee had used the hotline to raise a complaint about O’Reilly.

Oh, why did you pinheads dangle that in front of a lawyer?

[Wendy Walsh’s] lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said that they decided to call the hotline because the company had said that nobody had done so.

And the other shoe drops. Bloom’s client, Wendy Walsh, says O’Reilly rescinded a verbal agreement to make her a network contributor after she refused to join him in his hotel suite in 2013.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Reacting to the news that Paul, Weiss would be looking into these allegations, Bloom took to Twitter:

Many corps have independent investigators look into sex harassment claims. FoxNews uses the law firm that defends it [https://t.co/hTCU4LRcYd](https://t.co/hTCU4LRcYd)

— Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) [April 10, 2017](https://twitter.com/LisaBloom/status/851286595499991041)

The New England Patriots would agree with you. Still, in defense of Paul, Weiss, Fox previously brought them on to conduct the internal investigation of network honcho Roger Ailes and they unceremoniously kicked him to the curb, so there’s no reason to question the firm’s integrity. And, frankly, this critique doesn’t make any sense. Fox is hemorrhaging money over O’Reilly’s allegations, so even if Paul, Weiss would trade its integrity to tell a client what they wanted to hear — and they wouldn’t — Fox is probably eagerly hoping the firm’s going to give them the cover they need to ditch the guy throwing their primetime ad revenue into a black hole so they can give the show to Tomi Lahren.

Meanwhile, we’ve already gotten some exclusive footage of O’Reilly’s lawyers trying to prepare him for his formal interview with Paul, Weiss:

[Fox Asks Law Firm to Investigate Bill O’Reilly Harassment Claim](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/09/business/media/fox-bill-oreilly-harassment-claim.html/) [New York Times]

Earlier: [Free Market Does What The Court System Could Not: Hurt Bill O’Reilly](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/free-market-does-what-the-court-system-could-not-hurt-bill-oreilly/)

[ [1]](#reff1) UPDATE: Fox reached out to us to object to this phrase “coming on board” because Paul Weiss was already involved in the Ailes investigation. Obviously, the company could have hired a different firm to investigate a new complaint about a different person — it’s not uncommon to engage multiple firms on multiple independent matters. So, apparently, Fox wants the media to consider this O’Reilly complaint to be the same matter as the investigation into the culture of sexual harassment probe that resulted in canning Ailes, which says something.

# Return To The Office: How Much Money Would It Take For Lawyers To Give Up Remote Flexibility?
## It's going to take much bigger raises for attorneys to voluntarily give up working from home.

For more than a year, lawyers and legal staff have largely worked from home thanks to the pandemic. But now, with the coronavirus crisis in the rearview mirror thanks to widespread vaccination protocols, law firms of all kinds have announced their reopening plans — some with hopes to return to the pre-COVID status quo of all office, all the time, and others more than willing to offer the remote flexibility that employees have become accustomed to during these unprecedented times.

Not everyone is terribly eager to return to the office, and we have it on pretty good authority that some attorneys are dreading it. But that got us wondering: how much money would it take for lawyers to put aside their dreams of remote flexibility? In the wake of the latest Biglaw pay hike, let us be the first to tell you the answer is not a 7.9% salary increase (i.e., the new $205K salary scale).

Are lawyers ready to return to their offices? What would be more preferable, more money or permanent work-from-home options?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We polled more than 600 attorneys and staff members across hundreds of Biglaw and boutique law firms from almost every state in America to find out what lies ahead for the legal workforce in the wake of the pandemic.

As it turns out, money — lots of it — talks, and it would make lawyers reluctantly leave their remote work capabilities behind. According to our survey, it would take a 30% increase to get over half of our respondents to choose to forgo the ability to work remotely. A combined 357 of the 600-plus who took our poll said a 10%, 20%, or 30% salary increase would be their choice over permanent remote flexibility.

Which is more appealing to you?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


The harsh reality is that a 30% raise won’t be coming, and like it or not, we’ll all have to return to our offices at some point in the future. So, with that having been said, we got down to misery business with our next question (respondents were allowed to select all choices that applied).

What are you dreading most about a return to in-office work?



Commuting (76.80%), work/life balance (57.19%), and professional dress code (35.25%) were identified as the top three things respondents were dreading most about the return to in-office work.

On the other side of the coin, even if lawyers are being forced to return to the office, there are some bright spots for those who have more or less been confined to their homes for more than 15 months. Respondents were allowed to select all choices that applied for our next question.

What are you looking forward to most about a return to in-office work?



Seeing colleagues in-person (59.85%), office resources (43.63%), and being out of the house (39.96%) were identified as the top three things respondents were looking forward to the most about the return to in-office work.

When asked to share their general thoughts on office reentry, our survey respondents really spoke their minds and some common themes emerged. Here are some select responses that we thought would really resonate with others.

Permanent flexible remote work scheduling is desired by most respondents (but that shouldn’t mean that attorneys are available to work at all hours).

-
- “Why any firm wouldn’t offer flexible WFH policies after the last 15 months is totally beyond me and a sign of the refusal of many law firms to join the 21st Century.”
- “Although there’s a gap in workplace camaraderie, I think the quality of people’s work can now shine through in the remote environment, rather than allowing commonality or favoritism to dictate work assignment.”
- “During the pandemic, what little boundaries we had in Biglaw were dissolved. Now we get partners assigning work at 10 pm due that night and calls on weekends where we get chided for not responding within an hour on a weekend. If this 24/7 nature of the firm continues and we have to be in the office, I believe many mid-levels who are burnt out will leave. We need mandated vacation annually where we’re required to turn devices off.  WIthout that, post pandemic work is going to be hell.”
There is a sense that only lawyers think a return to the office is necessary.

-
- “The fact that some dinosaur partners miss being at their desks and can’t handle the fact that not everybody wants that, or works like that, is shortsighted. Every associate who got a “return to status quo” is looking to move right now, and law students aren’t looking to lose their flexibility – this is what they’ve literally grown up in the law doing. What a terrible loss of resources and revenue that will be for these rigid firms.”
- “The individuals at my Am Law 100 firm pushing for full time in person office reopening are all older partners who have been skirting health care guidance the entire pandemic to go into the office because that is “just the way they work.” Some partners never adjusted to the “new normal” of working from home, so instead of letting us enjoy the flexibility it provides us and the cost-savings it would provide the firm, they want us to come back in person full time because they had to when they were associates. Not compelling.”
- “I regard returning to the office as retrograde, something we’ll look back at in 20 years as a quaint relic. Most of the people I know champing at the bit to go back say it’s important for “office culture” and other fundamentally immeasurable and unprovable qualities. It seems like it mostly a way for sad sack boomers with no lives outside of work to socialize despite the manifest idiocy of commuting just to do the exact same thing you were going to do at home. I will probably lateral to a firm with a better policy soon.”
Many believe that their productivity increased while working from home.

-
- “Last year was my most productive year – I was one of the top billing associates in the firm, and I got favorable news about my prospects as partner, which is my dream. But I would rather quit my job than be back in the office full time. This has been an insanely stressful time for everyone, but we’ve also learned that you absolutely can be productive outside of the office.”
- “The last year proved that everyone at my law firm can do their jobs wonderfully without being in the office. The pandemic has changed our firm forever.”
Staff are feeling neglected and underappreciated.

-
- “Staff has been completely disregarded. We’re people too, and we had to pivot to remote work just like attorneys did. We certainly didn’t see any COVID bonuses for working from 7 a.m. – 9 p.m.”
- “Why does a solution have to be one-size fits all or flexibility just for attorneys? Professional staff share some of the same concerns as the attorneys.”
COVID safety is still an issue, especially thanks to the new Delta variant.

-
- “Everyone will not be vaccinated so I am not looking forward to going back.”
- “I will not return to the office until my children are vaccinated.
Are you ready to return to the office? We know the attorneys who responded “noooooooooooooooooooooo” and “WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY – seriously there isn’t a good reason” aren’t looking forward to it. As with all things having to do with COVID-19, these plans are likely subject to some amount of change, but be sure to prepare yourselves for office life once again — because it’s happening, and soon.

# One Way To Get Senior Associates To Lateral Biglaw Firms? Offer Them Partnership
## Partnership ahead!

We already know that Biglaw is super busy and there really aren’t enough qualified lawyers out there to handle all of the work. That has led to intense competition for qualified associates and begat a scorching [hot lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/) with all manner of repercussions, like [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/), [signing bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/), [retention bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-skadden-arps-handing-out-retention-bonuses-to-only-some-associates/), [raises](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2021-associate-salary-increase/), [offers without interviews](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-job-offers-without-interviews-what-hath-the-hot-lateral-market-wrought/) — basically a lot of money is being thrown around.

The newest hotness for the battle for senior associates is lateral job offers bumping their title from associate to partner.

As Adam Oliver, CEO and co-founder of Firm Prospects, [says](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/when-biglaw-firms-needed-bodies-they-just-offered-partnership-titles-to-associates/), “Firms used this as a way to lure those senior associates away from one firm to another. They needed bodies. The only way they could get people to jump ship was to offer partnership on day one.”

The prevalence of the practice has skyrocketed. [Law360 reports](https://www.law360.com/articles/1479262) it’s up 35 percent from 2019 to 2021 amongst the largest 100 Biglaw firms.

And the firms that are positioned to take advantage of the trend are those with two tiers of partnership:

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this hiring practice was the most common by far among law firms with a two-tiered partnership structure, such as Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP and Polsinelli PC, which topped the list of firms making the most hires. Of the just under 400 associate-to-partner hires at the 200 largest firms by revenue over the last three years, only 14 were made by firms with one-tier partnerships. And of those, 12 went to FisherBroyles, which only has partners, one to Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP and one to Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP.

When there are winners there are losers, and reportedly the firms losing the most of these associates to become partners elsewhere include DLA Piper, Lewis Brisbois, Morgan Lewis & Bockius, Skadden, and Norton Rose Fulbright.

Another motivating factor for the trend is also that clients want partners, not associates (even senior ones) on their matters. As Gary Miles, founder of Miles Partner Placement said, “There has been a dynamic in the legal industry going on for the past several years where clients are more reluctant to use associates on matters versus more senior folks … and they’re questioning billing rates for associate.” And even though the work’s of the same, “There may be no difference in the quality of the attorney between a nonequity partner and a superstar associate, but at the end of the day the outward representation is important.”

Gift giving is one of those inexorable stressors of the holiday season. Whether you’re trying to figure out what to get your mom this year, how much to tip your door person, or what to give your child care worker. And, of course, COVID has only complicated the equation: you can’t travel to see mom so finding that extra special gift is even more important, expressing how appreciative you are that your door person is essential and will sign for the multitude of Amazon packages you get is paramount, and having someone helping your kid with math homework while you are busy billing has made your life possible.

It’s generally a tradition for lawyers at Biglaw to give gifts — usually cash — to the support staff that make their job smoother. And how much you should give to that essential paralegal is not always clear, even in the best of times. Our network of tipsters has reported a wide spectrum of support staff gifts, from a measly $20 on the cheap end to an impressive $1,000 on the generous side. But when we [polled Above the Law readers last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/how-much-are-you-gifting-your-paralegal-admin-support-staff-this-holiday/?rf=1), assuming you’re a midlevel associate (and that amounts would scale up slightly as a senior or down as someone pretty junior), $300+ was the most popular answer.

But of course, things have changed in the pandemic. It’s no longer easy to just slip your admin a card loaded with cash in the hallway, so what are folks going to do? Venmo? Checks in the mail?

And while, by and large, special COVID appreciation bonuses will improve associates’ bank accounts at the top Biglaw firms, staff haven’t seen quite the largess (with [some notable exceptions](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/staff-bonuses/)). On the other hand, lots of firms [instituted austerity measures](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/salary-cuts/). But some attorneys have had to lean on the (often dwindling) ranks of support staff even more than usual to make sure nothing gets missed when everyone is working from home. All of which makes the Biglaw tipping balancing act more complex.

So, naturally, we’re asking our readers some important questions about holiday gift giving in Biglaw.

How much will you give support staff, compared to last year?

- The same amount
- Less than usual
- More than usual
- No gifts this year

# The 2021 Litigation Finance Survey Report
## A solid majority of our survey respondents stated that litigation finance has become more relevant to their practice in the last year.

Since 2017, in partnership with our friends at [Lake Whillans](https://lakewhillans.com/), we have conducted an annual survey of the litigation finance landscape. Over the course of these five years, our findings have mapped a trajectory of ever-increasing awareness and acceptance of the practice of third-party litigation funding.

This year, two-thirds (65.7%) of our respondents indicated that they have firsthand experience working with a litigation finance firm. While this represents a slight decline from last year’s 69.8%, it indicates that the gains in reported experience were not a temporary spike. Levels of firsthand experience with third-party funding among our respondents are up more than 20 percentage points since we began fielding our survey. A look at this metric since the inception of this survey:



This year’s findings — our first since the onset of the global pandemic — buttress this growth narrative and demonstrate that claim monetization, financing of claimholders, and capital for law firms are powerful solutions for the challenges faced by companies as they creatively adapt to this “Next Normal.”

# Biglaw Firm Offers Associates Raises, But Only If They Bill Enough
## Most, but not all, associates will be getting a raise.

Yes, yes, I know — billable hours are very important to Biglaw firms. It is, after all, how they make their money. Yet, for the most part, the associate salary increases that are sweeping through Biglaw have been across the board, without reference to a specific billable hour target.

Haynes and Boone, a firm that made $430,200,000 in gross revenue last year ranking it 93rd on the Am Law 100, announced the below raises for associates:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But there’s a catch — associates will only get these raises if they billed 1,800 hours (with up to 100 pro bono hours counting towards that number) in the 12 months prior as of June 30, 2021 (the class of 2020 is exempt from this requirement). Folks will have an opportunity to get a catch-up payment if they hit that billable hours target by year end.

According to the firm, this will bring *most* associates up to market compensation. You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/hb-raises/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff.

# Davis Polk Smashes Bonus Scale Again With Year-End Bonuses PLUS More Special Bonuses
## DPW comes over the top. Yet again.

If the 2021 bonus season has [seemed a little slow](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/cravath-already-kicked-off-bonus-season-but-where-are-all-the-bonuses/), well, there was good reason. Yes, Cravath [announced](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/cravath-kicks-off-year-end-bonus-season-with-payouts-reaching-115k-2021-11-22/) some pretty generous bonuses, but some firms <<cough Davis Polk, cough cough>> have a penchant for [coming over the top](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) of [announced bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) ([and raise](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/)) scales, sending the Biglaw market into a tizzy. So, waiting until Davis Polk & Wardwell makes their bonus announcement seems, well, prudent — and Biglaw is nothing if not prudent.

Well, the excuses are over because DPW has made their move. And, of course, it’s over the top of the Cravath scale.

To be clear, the year-end bonus amount matches the Cravath scale, a hefty ~15 percent over last year’s bonus numbers for most classes. But what sets DPW apart (at least until the matches start rolling in) is the additional round of special bonuses for class of 2020 and higher ranging from $4,000 to $23,000.

# More Biglaw Firms Encourage Associates And Staff To Use Gender Pronouns In Email Signatures
## This is a move that goes far in setting the tone of inclusion at law firms.

Biglaw firms across the globe continue to promote diversity and inclusion among their ranks by instituting transgender-friendly workplace policies. To that end, many firms have decided to embrace the full gender spectrum by encouraging any and all employees — not just their transgender, genderqueer, and nonbinary employees — to use gender pronouns in their email signatures.

Earlier this month, we wrote about Sidley Austin’s heartening step forward when it offered firmwide approval and support for employees to add gender pronouns to their signature blocks. As it turns out, many other firms have done the exact same thing. Here are just a few of them, plus interesting facts about each firm’s steps toward inclusivity if included by tipsters:

- Ballard Spahr
- Cleary Gottlieb
- Cozen O’Connor
- Fried Frank (chairman David Greenwald uses he/him/his in his email signature)
- Jenner & Block
- Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton
- Littler (gender-based pronouns have been eliminated from the firm’s HR materials and employees can choose a nonbinary identifier in the firm’s internal HR system)
- Mayer Brown
- Pepper Hamilton (the firm has a Name Change Project practice group in which attorneys assist low-income transgender individuals with free legal name change services)
- Paul Weiss (chairman Brad Karp and deputy chair Valerie Radwaner both added pronouns to their signatures last year)
- Ropes & Gray (the firm has dedicated thousands of hours of pro bono work to helping people update name and gender markers on identity documents)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
If you’re still not sure why your firm should support and encourage gender pronouns in email signatures, here’s a powerful message on solidarity from a source at Sidley:

I know a lot of people don’t necessarily understand why this is important, or think that because they don’t “need” to provide their pronouns they shouldn’t bother adding the pronouns themselves. However, it can be incredibly isolating being the “only” person who needs/wants to self-identify pronouns, so there is power and support in having others do it first/with you. It’s such a small and easy thing that we can all do to be more inclusive and welcoming, and it can make a huge impact on people feeling marginalized or unseen.

This is a remarkably simple move, a “small” action indeed, but one that goes pretty far in setting the tone of inclusion at a law firm. Does your firm support the usage of gender pronouns in email signatures? Please let us know.

# Judge Posner Rips Poor Winston & Strawn Lawyer
## Judge Posner and Judge Hamilton tag team a litigator given an impossible task.

We’ve chronicled Judge Posner’s [biting questioning style](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/02/the-benchslap-dispatches-i-pity-the-fool-who-tries-to-talk-over-judge-posner/) and [incapacity to suffer fools](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/judge-posner-lights-into-pro-se-sovereign-citizen/). Frankly, it’s why we love him — a honey badger of a snark monster worthy of every accolade this publication can bestow.

Which is why we relished this audio clip from a recent oral argument where Judge Posner held out all of nine seconds before interrupting to announce, “Look, I have to say, I do not understand your position at all.” And so begins the worst 10 minutes of this lawyer’s life. Poor [Joseph Torres](http://www.winston.com/en/who-we-are/attorneys/torres-joseph-j.html) of Winston & Strawn had the unenviable task of representing industrial giant Caterpillar and having to defend the indefensible. After a worker died tragically, representatives of United Steelworkers immediately sought access to examine the scene of the accident to ensure the safety of its members. Caterpillar refused and offered a DVD showing the machinery from one angle, citing Holyoke Water recognizing that the right of employers to control their property must be balanced against the rights of employees to be responsibly represented by a union.

(Clip edited to include just Caterpillar’s initial argument. You can listen to the entire oral argument including all parties [here](http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/sound/external/sp.14-3528.14-3528_09_09_2015.mp3).)

Judge Posner’s exasperation over Caterpillar’s inability to identify any harm in honoring the union’s request hits its crescendo at the 9:24 mark when he proclaims, “Yeah, but, you know, the problem with the balancing test is there’s nothing on your side of the balance!”

More somber but no less scathing is Judge David Hamilton (Judge Manion was also on the panel but remained out of the Torres inquisition). In Caterpillar’s opening brief, it argued:

The critical inquiry is whether access is required in order for the union to undertake its investigation. If not, the employer’s competing property interests prevail, whether the underlying issue that the union seeks to investigate an industrial accident or a leaky faucet.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Judge Hamilton did not appreciate this line of argument. At 3:39, he scolds Torres for suggesting that a workplace fatality falls on some sliding scale just an uptick from a leaky faucet, a rhetorical flourish that he probably regrets today.

The whole argument is worth a listen. Throughout the clip, Judge Posner can be heard mocking the idea that a non-employee union representative would be stealing industrial secrets or sneaking onto the premises for any reason other than the death of an employee. The lashing elicits more than a couple laughs — I’m particularly fond of Judge Posner’s exacerbated “oh come on!” in the middle of an answer to a Judge Hamilton question — even if the underlying case is no laughing matter.

For Torres, he can’t really be blamed for having to put lipstick on the pig Caterpillar handed him. Stonewalling the union after someone died made for a pretty hard sell. At least Torres can take heart that a thorough beating from Judges Posner and Hamilton may be an unpleasant professional experience, but in the grand scheme of things, it’s much closer to a leaky faucet.

# Meet A Former Supreme Court Clerk And Wife Of A Biglaw Partner Who Vocally Supports Donald Trump
## Why on earth would a woman lawyer with these credentials back Donald Trump?

Wendy Long (by Beowulf Sheehan)

Let’s not mince words: expressing enthusiastic support for Donald Trump is… déclassé. As a person with some right-of-center views and many conservative and libertarian friends, mainly through Federalist Society circles, I know a decent number of people who might or will vote for Donald Trump. But they’re not happy about it, and their support for the Republican presidential nominee is very sotto voce.

At the [recent reunion](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/a-leading-light-of-the-federal-judiciary-will-take-senior-status-by-years-end/) of law clerks to my former boss, Judge Diarmuid O’Scannlain of the Ninth Circuit, I did an off-the-record, informal survey of attendees about whom they support in the election. In this fairly conservative group — law clerks to a high-profile, right-of-center judge, including former clerks to conservative Supreme Court justices and lawyers who have served in high-ranking posts in Republican administrations — I found just one vocal Trump supporter. Everyone else will vote for him reluctantly and quietly (mainly because of his [declared intentions](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/) on [SCOTUS appointments](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/making-scotus-even-greater-trumps-supplemental-supreme-court-shortlist/)), vote for Gary Johnson, not vote this year, or — horror of horrors! — vote for Hillary Clinton.

So given the disdain for [“the short-fingered vulgarian”](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/03/how-donald-trump-became-the-short-fingered-vulgarian) among legal elites — graduates of top law schools, law clerks to leading judges, lawyers at prominent Biglaw firms — it’s interesting to find one exceedingly well credentialed lawyer who supports the Donald. And this lawyer is a woman, interestingly enough — not a demographic Trump does well with, especially in the wake of his [latest offensive comments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html?tid=a_inl).

Meet [Wendy Long](https://wendylong.com/), the Republican Party’s nominee for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who was just profiled in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/nyregion/as-others-flee-new-yorks-republican-senate-hopeful-sticks-by-donald-trump.html):

The Republican nominee for United States senator from New York refers to America by feminine pronouns, as in “her borders” and “her values.”

She once apologized when using a vulgar word to describe her opponent’s economic policies, and paused demurely when searching for a family-friendly synonym for one’s rear end, settling finally, with a smile, on “derrière.”

When the Pledge of Allegiance was recited at a recent event, she pressed her hand to her heart — and, seconds after everyone else had moved on, kept it there.

That, at first glance, is Wendy E. Long, a former Supreme Court clerk and corporate litigator turned home-schooling mother and reluctant politician. Once an unsuccessful challenger to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, she will soon be, in all likelihood, an unsuccessful challenger to another Democrat, Senator Charles Schumer.

As you can see from her [New York Times wedding announcement](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/08/style/weddings-wendy-stone-arthur-long.html), Wendy Long graduated from Dartmouth College and Northwestern Law School before clerking for SCOTUS, where she met her husband, and practicing as a Biglaw litigatrix. The Times profile offers a good summary of her dazzling CV:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Her résumé braids elite credentials with conservative fervor. After working for two Republican senators in Washington, she clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas — “the greatest living American,” in her words — and married a fellow clerk, Arthur Long, who is now a partner at the firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.

When the couple moved to New York, where Mr. Long grew up, she worked as a litigator at Kirkland & Ellis before helping to found the Judicial Confirmation Network, now known as the Judicial Crisis Network, which pushed for the confirmations of right-leaning Supreme Court nominees.

And unlike many GOP nominees seeking elective office in blue states, this conservative candidate is firmly on board the Trump Train:

As a group, women for Trump would seem to be an increasingly endangered species. Yet Ms. Long, a mother of two, says she has supported Mr. Trump since before he announced his candidacy, and still does, despite finding his recorded comments from 2005 “repulsive.” Intelligent women, she said, would see that an 11-year-old tape had little bearing on today’s urgent issues.

“I do think it’s just words,” she said in a recent interview, adding that she had found Mr. Trump’s apologies sincere. “I don’t believe he’s ever raped anyone, which I do believe Bill Clinton has done, and Hillary Clinton has enabled that.”

…. [Long praised Trump] for what she called his unpolished, uncalculated style — “He’s not your typical mealy-mouthed politician” — and his gusto for pulping elite orthodoxies. But even if Ms. Long says Mr. Trump’s candidacy spurred her moonshot bid for the Senate and shaped much of her current thinking about immigration (build a wall), Muslim refugees (the country needs “extreme vetting”) and trade (keep American jobs American), her politics are no dalliance.

“I’ve never really fit in,” she said, whether at a big law firm or on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where she lives. “I’m kind of a small-town girl.”

Can this “small-town girl” with big-time achievements unseat a [popular](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/schumer-nominated-senate-state-dems-article-1.2548233) and entrenched incumbent — while carrying the baggage of supporting Donald Trump in a state he might lose by [more than twenty points?](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_trump_vs_clinton-5792.html) I’d say the odds are long, lowercase “l” — but at least give Wendy Long credit for standing up for her beliefs.

# After Wedding, Biglaw Associate Drastically Overbills Her Way To A 9-Month Suspension

‘Bye-bye, Biglaw career!’

What happens when you’re a second-year Biglaw associate who’s allowed wedding planning to get the best of you? You’re a little short on billable hours and you’re afraid that you’re going to lose your job, so you do what almost any associate in your position would do — you overbill the hell out of some clients and hope to god that the firm doesn’t notice.

Unfortunately for Mary Jaclyn Cook, the firm did notice, and she’s not only a former associate at Faegre Baker Daniels, but she’s been suspended from the practice of law for nine months. Uh-oh…

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Last December, Cook got married and honeymooned in a Hawaiian paradise, knowing full well that she was about 368 hours shy of the firm’s annual 1,850-hour expectation. When she returned to the firm’s Colorado outpost, she faced the hellish reality of having to log more than 100 fabricated hours in a fruitless effort to keep her job, as the firm caught on quite quickly to what she’d done.

Here are some additional details from the [Am Law Daily](http://www.dailybusinessreview.com/id=1202796398567):


Mary Cook

Cook’s final December log reflected 21 workdays where she billed more than 12 hours. She did not bill for some of the days she was in Hawaii for her wedding and honeymoon. To make up for that, she billed more than 15 hours a day for a 12-day stretch at the beginning of the month, including back-to-back 18- and 19-hour days.

One red flag that [Denver office leader of the products liability practice, Heather] Perkins, spotted was Cook billing 175 hours for a single client, which was more than the 2014 graduate from the University of Denver Sturm College of Law averaged for all of her clients in a given month.

When she was confronted about the fabricated hours, Cook at first claimed that they were legitimate, but later broke down and admitted to her dramatic overbilling, worth nearly $40,000. Cook was offered the option of resigning from the firm, and the Colorado Attorney Regulation Counsel eventually became involved. She received a nine-month suspension for her misconduct, and said she was “gravely embarrassed” about the entire affair.

As for Faegre Baker, a spokeswoman said a failure to meet hours wasn’t even considered a basis for dismissal. According to a statement released by the firm, “We communicate regularly with associates on the standards and competencies by which they are evaluated, and offer many resources to help our lawyers build successful careers. The firm also provides numerous outlets for associates who are concerned about their volume of work—high or low—including advisors, supervising partners, group leaders, office leaders and talent professionals.”

Sadly for Mary Cook, being unemployed and unable to practice law isn’t really an optimal way to start a marriage. We hope that she doesn’t hold this against her spouse and remain resentful for the rest of their lives.

# Vault 100 Rankings: The Most Prestigious Law Firms In America (2024)
## Money continues to matter most for Biglaw associates.

What do associates at major law firms care about more than money? Prestige, of course. But, at the end of the day, sometimes being a leader when it comes to compensation is enough to boost a firm’s prestige. As luck would have it, the closely watched Vault 100 rankings are here to remind lawyers at the nation’s largest law firms about exactly which ones are considered the most prestigious.

In last year’s Vault 100 rankings, Cravath — the firm that brought the associate salary scale all the way [up to $415,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) back in February 2022 — managed to retain its number 1 spot, while Wachtell Lipton reclaimed the second-place title, after being edged out by Skadden the year prior for the first time in the history of the Vault rankings.

But was Cravath able to keep its cachet as the most prestigious Biglaw firm in the country in this year’s Vault rankings?

Of course it was. Here’s what Carter Isham, Vault’s law editor, had to say about [Cravath’s placement](https://firsthand.co/blogs/vaults-law-blog-legal-careers-and-industry-news/announcing-the-2024-vault-100-practice-area-prestige-and-regional-prestige-rankings) in the latest rankings: “While other firms have stepped in as ‘first movers’ in recent compensation and hiring trends, Cravath’s influence on industry standards holds firm.” Cravath continues to remain the namesake for salaries because of its prestigious pull, with survey respondents referring to the firm as “the benchmark for pay scale” and “still the firm to beat.”

Although Cravath stayed on top, this year, there was some movement when it came to the Top 10 in the rankings. Here are the Top 10 Most Prestigious Law Firms based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2024:

- Cravath, Swaine & Moore
- Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz
- Skadden
- Latham & Watkins
- Sullivan & Cromwell
- Davis Polk & Wardwell
- Kirkland & Ellis
- Simpson Thacher
- Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison
- Gibson Dunn

This is the sixth year in a row that these firms have been in the Top 10, but as you can see, there were some fluctuations in rank among them. Davis Polk — which became known for its big-money raises and bonuses in recent years but failed to offer special bonuses this past summer — lost some ground, dropping to No. 6 (down from No. 4 last year), with Latham and SullCrom picking up the slack (up one spot each). Still within the Top 20, at No. 17, we find Milbank (down six spots from No. 11 last year) — we suppose everyone forgot that this was the firm that kicked off the 2022 salary wars in the first place.

# The 500 Largest Law Firms In America And The Gigantic Salaries Some Are Paying (2021)
## Size matters in the legal profession -- especially when salaries are so big.

There are many different and exciting ways to rank law firms. How prestigious are they? How much money are they making? How much do partners earn? How much are associates earning in cash compensation? How big are they?

Yes, size matters, and because the legal profession is obsessed with every single measurable and quantifiable factor law firms have to offer, there’s obviously a ranking for that. And that ranking is even more important this year because not only did the legal profession weather a pandemic — one that started with furloughs and layoffs and ended in white-hot lateral recruitment — but many of these firms are now handing out multiple millions more in compensation to associates and counsel.

Today, the National Law Journal unleashed its annual [NLJ 500](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/06/23/the-nlj-500-our-2021-survey-of-the-nations-largest-law-firms/), a ranking of the largest law firms in the United States covering the previous calendar year. What does law firm headcount look like after the wild ride that was 2020?

These are the 10 largest law firms in America, and these are the salaries associates will be receiving as of July 1, 2021, and the special bonuses they’re due to receive:

# Biglaw Firms Swoop In To Staff 'Emergency Rescue' Deal To Save Another Bank From Going Under
## The 167-year-old bank meets its end to avoid a financial crisis.

It was one hell of a weekend for bankers and lawyers. In order to prevent Credit Suisse from joining the ranks of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, teams of legal and financial advisers worked day and night to broker a historic, government-backed takeover of the bank by its former rival, UBS.

Now that Credit Suisse has been acquired by UBS for the fire-sale price of $3.2 billion, all of the lawyers that lined up in droves to represent both banks deserve a huge round of applause.

According to [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/03/20/host-of-firms-advise-on-historic-ubs-takeover-of-credit-suisse-405-119257/), Walder Wyss, a Swiss firm, served as lead counsel to Credit Suisse, while Sullivan & Cromwell and Cleary Gottlieb advised on the capital markets and banking & finance aspects of the transaction. On the other side of the deal, UBS was counseled by a host of Biglaw firms, including Davis Polk & Wardwell, Swiss firm Bar & Karrer, and Freshfields. On top of all those firms, sources say that Linklaters, Latham & Watkins, and Fried Frank were likely involved in the deal as well.

So, what does this mean for the merged banks going forward?

In a statement, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher commented: “This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue. We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure.”

Uf widerluege, Credit Suisse. Congratulations to all of the firms that helped to see this deal through to the end.

# Jones Day Raises Salaries But Remains A Black Box

Jones Day announced raises, which at most firms is great news. And it is, to a degree, at Jones Day — after all, the base for junior associates has moved to the new market standard. But for the majority of associates, the firm’s notoriously opaque compensation system is a source of anger.

Just take a look at an exemplar of the complaints we are hearing:

[New raise is] well below what it should be. Have heard from at least one other with same experience who falls in same range and many others are unsatisfied and below market. Would love to see a collection of salaries like you did in 2016!

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So, why, exactly is compensation information so difficult to discern at the firm? Well, there is no official scale for older associates as the system is [“closed comp”](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/09/jones-day-secrecy-breeds-strength/) or [“black box,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/08/inside-straight-analyzing-black-box-compensation/) meaning that nobody knows what anyone else makes. Attorneys, both at the associate and partner level, are just supposed to live with the secrecy. Talking about your comp with colleagues is verboten; the firm claims this promotes collegiality and teamwork by eliminating complaints over pay so lawyers can focus on their work and client service. Which sounds nice in theory, but, as we’ve seen, also breeds a lot of frustration.

After the 2016 raises, ATL spent [a lot of timing digging into the numbers behind Jones Day’s compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/?rf=1). What we found was — by and large — compensation below market rates and a lot of angry associates. Another key difference to the JD model: The firm doesn’t pay year-end or mid-year bonuses; you get just your base salary. Mid-year, you’re notified of what your base salary will be for the coming year, which, allegedly should be above market to reflect the lack of bonuses, but not so much the reality for associates on the ground. And especially in a year with special bonuses on top of year-end bonuses, the Jones Day compensation looks pretty grim from what we’re hearing. The new salary goes into effect on July 1 and then the following June you get your next pay raise letter, starting the cycle anew.

Associates at JD, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Jones%20Day) (subject line: “Jones Day”) or text us (646-820-8477) with any and all information you have about your compensation or comp for other associates you know. You can provide a range for pay if you prefer doing that over giving an exact number. As you can see from[ past efforts to shine light into the black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/?rf=1) of associate compensation, providing us with your year, a sense of your hours (low: >1800, average: 1800-2000, high: 2000+), and salary range is very, very useful.

We’d love another crack at opening up Jones Day’s black box.

# Top 10 Biglaw Firm To Close Its Doors In Russia

We continue to be horrified by the war in Ukraine and the growing devastation and suffering it is causing. We stand with the people of Ukraine and those across the world in condemning Russia’s military aggression. And we stand with our legal community and the wider business community calling for an immediate end to hostilities and a withdrawal of all Russian forces from Ukraine.

We have determined that we can no longer continue to operate in Russia and we will be progressing with an orderly wind down of our operations in Moscow. We deeply care about and value our colleagues in Russia and our focus is on their safety and wellbeing. Working with them, we will transition the business and wind down our operations in compliance with our legal, regulatory, and professional obligations.

— An excerpt from a memo sent to all employees from the leaders of Hogan Lovells, concerning the firm’s decision to close its Moscow office in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. More than a dozen firms have also announced plans to make exits from Moscow.

# OMG, China Has ACTUAL Legal Robots And All The Legal Tech Patents
## All of these examples are actual examples of the technology that has been live in the Chinese justice system for at least five years.

I spoke recently at [LegalOps.com’s](https://legalops.com/) inaugural conference and I started off by painting a picture of the future.

Imagine a litigant walking into court and telling a robot the claim it would like to file. The robot advises the litigant on the total expected cost of pursuing the case as well as a prediction of success or failure based on past similar cases. If the litigant wants to proceed, the robot will automatically generate the complaint. If it looks like their expected value is negative, they can pursue adjudication or mediation, which will unclog courts.

Imagine in the criminal justice system, all participants join an internet court from home. Participants prepare via apps designed to provide legal advice. Judges are advised by AI on typical sentences for particular crimes and if they deviate from the norm, sentences are flagged for review.

I asked the audience how far away this future is. Answers ranged from two to 10 years.

But to quote an overused statement from [William Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson), “The future is here, it’s just not evenly distributed.” Which is to say that all of these examples are actual examples of the technology that has been live in the Chinese justice system for at least five years.

At the same time, China is like the Michael Jordan of filing legal technology patents[. Of all the legal technology patents filed in the world last year, China filed  nearly two-thirds.](https://www.cityam.com/law-firms-filed-over-1000-legal-tech-patents-globally-but-only-1-was-filed-in-the-uk/) The United Kingdom — home to one of the most innovative tech sectors and host to numerous legal tech companies (like my own, [Hence Technologies](http://www.hence.ai/)) filed … one.

What’s going on here?

China is trying to solidify its version of rule of law and deliver justice to near 1.5 billion people. It’s not really practical to educate tens of millions of lawyers to do that. So it has taken sweeping steps to digitize its justice system, as it has with many other sectors.

To understand that further, I spoke with [Benjamin Minhao Chen](https://www.law.hku.hk/academic_staff/benjamin-m-chen/) and [Zhiyu Li](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/zhiyu-li/), who published a deeply insightful study about use of advanced technology in the Chinese justice system called “[How Will Technology Change the Face of Chinese Justice?](https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/cjal/article/view/7484/3923)” in the Columbia Journal of Asian Law.

With government support, technology and AI companies in China are able to deliver the full suite of legal services and obviate the need for human lawyers in many cases. That eases burdens in courts and makes access to justice more readily available. Besides, lawyers have lots of opinions and can lead social movements that can get pretty annoying if you’re a government trying to avoid that.

Thus, what we see in China is a state-backed move to get technology into the courts, and we see this embraced at all levels of the legal system. There are the sentencing tools and robot lawyers described above. Seriously, you can walk into a court in China, and a robot will tell you if you are likely to win your case and how much it might cost you.

But it flows downstream too. A visit to a legal aid center in Chengdu by Chen revealed a system where you can register, print materials you need, and AI will highlight cases that are similar to yours to examine to help you prep. If you need help from human lawyers, they are on standby in the clinic and have a hotline too. There’s even a live dashboard in the lobby of legal aid cases, which shows the type, quantity, and status of the cases.


(Photo by Benjamin Minhao Chen)

Li told me that the AI’s role really is designed to be “assistive” rather than to replace lawyers themselves. But, still, this stands in stark contrast to the United States where regulations in most states explicitly limit the amount of help that technology can provide in the legal system. Even legal aid companies in the U.S. are met with swift accusations of unauthorized practice of law when they try to help provide support to those who would be unrepresented (for reference, [as much as 75% of civil cases in the U.S. have at least one party representing themselves](https://www.srln.org/node/548/srln-brief-how-many-srls-srln-2015)). Or where companies that claim they are the world’s first Robot Lawyer [get class actions lawsuits accusing them of being neither robots nor lawyers](https://www.nhbr.com/worlds-first-robot-lawyer-short-circuited-by-prosecutors-faces-class-action-suit/) — and get smacked with unauthorized practice of law accusations for offering AI-powered airpods to guide people in traffic court.

Now, let’s be clear that China has some other motivations in deploying these technologies. Sentencing recommendation software, for instance, can help also track whether sentences are lighter than usual, which might be an indicator of corruption.

But the point is that actual legal service delivery can only be innovated when we grapple with the fact that it’s not the technology that is unready. It’s the regulatory (and in the case of lawyers, the self-regulatory) system that holds back applications and use cases.

As I’ll outline in a subsequent piece, this is all about to change very fast, and we’re going to start to see these rules fall away in coming years.

But for now, let’s turn back to the clickbait about the patents. I’m not the first to highlight that China is completely and utterly dominant in legal services technology patent filing. But I’m probably the first to explain what’s going on here.

China is actually the world leader in filing patents on everything, and that stems from a national patent strategy and local subsidies to companies for filing those patents. So the datapoint about all its legal technology patents is actually misleading in that regard.

Which is to say that it doesn’t imply China will be the global legal tech leader of the future. But for now, its embrace of technology in the courts places it well ahead of the U.S. in terms of pace of adoption. And of the UK – I mean, c’mon, less than 1% of global legal tech patents is just sad for such a dynamic legaltech community.

# After Billing Endlessly For Years, Associate Turns Down Biglaw Partnership To Focus On Work-Life Balance
## 'Biglaw partnership is a mirage,' he told Above the Law.

Eli Albrecht and his family (courtesy photo)

Biglaw associates face constant pressure when it comes to meeting their billable hour expectations — and that pressure can grow even more when an associate hopes to become a partner someday.

But with a professional life that depends on billing, sometimes work-life balance gets tossed aside and lawyers find themselves missing out on other important things, like staying connected to their families and their friends. Important milestones can pass you by in the blink of an eye unless you take a moment to evaluate where your life is headed. If you take a step back, you may suddenly realize that this is not the life you envisioned for yourself.

This is exactly what happened to Eli Albrecht, a former Gibson Dunn associate who recently turned down a partnership offer at another Biglaw firm. Albrecht had long dreamed of becoming a partner. But as it turns out, it wasn’t meant to be.

###“Tell me this is not my forever.”
In a now viral [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eealbrecht_law-biglaw-career-activity-7070127077420593152-17AO/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios) post, Albrecht described how he threw himself completely into his work at his firm, bringing a sleeping bag to the office and leaving his family behind while he stayed there for days on end. In an interview with Above the Law, Albrecht said that he was billing between 2,500 and 3,000 hours each year. Unfortunately, while he was racking up billable hours, the family life he thought he’d built was crumbling. Here’s an excerpt from his LinkedIn post:

“[L]ife was happening outside of that high-rise office. My son took his first steps. My daughter cracked her first smile and said her first babbly words. My son was growing up and having crushes, and my daughters had dance parties I never saw. My wife built a flourishing business.”

Every breathless step I took toward that next title was a step that took me away from those I loved. I was losing touch with all life outside of that office and they were losing touch with me.

I came home one day and I was a stranger in my own house. I crumpled on my wife’s shoulder and said, tell me we can do better. Tell me this is not my forever.”

Albrecht had finally done it — Biglaw’s brass ring was nearly in hand, but it wasn’t like what he’d imagined. “I worked so hard to get the offer of law firm partnership,” he wrote, “and now that I am here, it is not what I want.”

With nearly 10,000 likes and more than 900 comments, Albrecht’s post hit home for many lawyers and legal professionals. It was his next step that may serve as inspiration for so many who may be be struggling in Biglaw and unwilling to make any more sacrifices when it comes to their personal lives: he decided that it was time to leave his firm. Albrecht wrote:

Today I’m turning down the pursuit of the Biglaw corner office. I’m turning down the offers for partnership at other Biglaw firms. Today, I am stepping off the hamster wheel.

The decision was not easy. I am taking a leap of faith. I am letting go of a certain and linear path to success and betting on myself.

Albrecht told Above the Law that he’d finally discovered that what he’d been pursuing for all those years was no longer worth pursuing. “Biglaw partnership is a mirage. I was pursuing this fantasy that turned out not to exist,” he said. “You don’t ever arrive at this magical place where you’re going to have time, and money, and the ability to engage deeply with your family while doing enriching work. It’s a mirage.”

The very next day, Albrecht announced that he had, in fact, taken up the partnership mantle — just not within a Biglaw setting. Albrecht is now a partner at SMB Law Group, a fully remote boutique firm that focuses on small and medium-sized mergers and acquisitions transactions. The firm, he says, is enabling him not only to to “do life-changing M&A work with real people,” but it’s also giving him the “freedom to control his own life.”

###“The choice I made for my family could not have been a better one.”
SMB Law Group “puts family first,” he told Above the Law. “Having the option to work remotely is so critical for people who want to balance family.” Albrecht says he’s working just as many hours as he did before, but thanks to SMB’s remote platform, he’s now able to be more involved with his family. “I used to leave the house before they were awake and come home after they were asleep. Now, I can give my kids big hugs when they come home from school. I can help them bathe them and put them to bed. It’s a whole new life.”

“SMB is building a new model of a law firm and I want to be along for the ride,” Albrecht said.

Congratulations to Eli Albrecht on finally finding the partnership role he dreamed of, on his own terms. Are you thinking of “stepping off the hamster wheel”? You may find just what you were looking for if you decide to make the leap.

# A Member Of The $160K-Plus Club Raises Associate Salaries Nationwide
## Yeehaw! This Texas-based firm is lassoing more cash for its associates.

Yeehaw! A Texas-based member of the [$160K-Plus Club](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-160k-plus-club/) — the designation for firms we previously highlighted for paying their first-year associates more than $160,000 per year — has adopted the new Cravath salary scale. McKool Smith, a firm that specializes in complex trial practice and whose attorneys pride themselves on their skills in the courtroom, just gave their associates another reason to be excited about litigating with the firm.

Prior to matching the Cravath salary scale, the firm paid a total compensation package of [$177,500](http://www.nalpdirectory.com/employer_profile?FormID=6680) to first-year associates: a $165,000 base salary, a $10,000 signing bonus, and a $2,500 year-end bonus. Now, their first-year associates will start at a base of $180,000, before any additional signing bonuses and year-end bonuses. We believe that McKool has increased salaries for all offices, including offices in Austin, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Marshall, New York, Silicon Valley, and Washington, D.C.

McKool Smith is the first member of the $160K-Plus Club that has announced salary raises to our knowledge. Other firms we’ve not yet heard from include Bickel & Brewer, Boies Schiller & Flexner, Desmarais LLP, Susman & Godfrey, Wachtell Lipton, and Williams & Connolly. Will McKool Smith’s move inspire other members of this elite club to raise their salaries even higher? We’ll have to wait and see.

# Donald Trump's Biglaw Attorney Is Helping Kanye West Get On The Presidential Ballot...
## Unfortunately, this makes perfect sense.

You’re smart. You can connect dots all by yourself, so I’ll just lay out the facts and trust you’ll figure out what is going on.

Attorney [Lane Ruhland](https://www.huschblackwell.com/professionals/lane-ruhland) is a senior counsel at Husch Blackwell — an Am Law 100 firm that made $380,303,000 in gross revenue last year. As recently as July 27th, court filings indicate Ruhland is working on behalf of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. And, [as reported by](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akzy3b/a-well-connected-gop-strategist-is-helping-kanye-west-get-on-the-ballot-in-wisconsin) Vice, Ruhland has a long history of supporting the GOP — she worked on the Romney campaign while in law school, and post graduation, has served in many positions supporting conservative goals:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Ruhland most recently was director of environmental and energy policy at Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, a GOP-leaning business group that often helps fund Republican candidates. Before that she was a deputy chief of staff for then-Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel (R), and from 2014-2015 was the Wisconsin Republican Party’s legal counsel.

And now it’s come to light that this tried and true GOP operative is helping none other than self-declared presidential candidate Kanye West get on the ballot. Take a look at the footage of Ruhland dropping off the signatures West needs to get on the Wisconsin ballot.

And Twitter has come to the rescue with receipts of Ruhland’s representations:

Lane Ruhland, the Wisconsin lawyer who dropped off Kanye West's presidential filing at the Wisconsin Board of Elections represented Donald Trump's presidential campaign exactly one week before in federal court [pic.twitter.com/RHajkRDiMO](https://t.co/RHajkRDiMO)

Ruhland isn’t some rogue GOP loyalist working on behalf of the rapper turned political candidate. GOP operative [Gregg Keller has done work](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/two-people-linked-to-kanye-wests-campaign-have-ties-to-gop.html) for West, and[ a number of folks who signed up](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/daniel-bice/2020/08/04/kanye-west-gets-helping-hand-gop-get-wisconsin-ballot/3296285001/) to be West electors have a long history with the Republican party. I guess propping up a potential spoiler candidate is more of a priority for the GOP than any actual policies.

Our society continues to shift closer to one that values relationships, respect, and responsibility between companies, consumers, and legal counsel. It is no longer enough to simply deliver a service or a product; a reliable connection must be made and nurtured as well. Below, I will talk about how those in leadership positions and modern lawyers must modify their approaches and engage in relationship building and social responsibility actions if they want continued success in the field.

Respectful Approaches

This alteration of approaches regarding different areas of the law is the backbone of [the conversation with Robin Meyer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEOK0AHW4MY), CIPP/US, CIPP/E, and general counsel for [TokenEx](http://www.tokenex.com/), a company that protects sensitive data through tokenization. She talks about how today’s lawyers must explore the evolving approaches to tech contracts and covers how to make those changes. There is a need to forge a different path forward to obtain success. Meyer believes that a fundamental aspect of this process is gaining and keeping the customer’s trust, especially in the tech industry. She discusses examples of customers feeling held hostage by the words in privacy statements or similar documents, which can potentially damage the relationship. Avoiding these damages is paramount to successful and respectful customer-provider relationships.

Team And Relationship Building

Modern lawyers need to do more than digging their heels in and grinding toward their goals alone. In today’s world, there is a strong focus on teams and building relationships. That is precisely what Sangeetha Raghunathan — a member of the executive team and general counsel, CCO, and head of government relations for Earnin, a financial services app — talks to us about in [this important conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI4Yr6wq4pA&t=515s). She explains how to go about building your legal teams, providing tips on building trustworthy relationships with colleagues. Among her most significant advice is to make sure you value your employees, especially since recruitment is difficult for all companies right now, as well as to focus on exactly what you want your legal department to look like.

Social Responsibility

Our world is undergoing a massive transformation as more companies make public commitments to sustainability goals, including attaining net-zero carbon emissions. In [this conversation with Christine Uri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnz2p6EidrA), chief sustainability and legal officer at ENGIE Impact, we talk about the role of in-house legal departments and their importance in helping companies chart their sustainability initiatives. At a time when social responsibility is not just a buzzword but a necessity for a thriving business, she allows us to see new opportunities for the modern lawyer to make a difference. She also talks to us about the importance of balance and self-care, stressing that we must make time to do the things needed for our well-being outside of our careers by focusing on mental, physical, and emotional health.


Humans crave connection, and that truth is evident in the movement toward relationship-focused interactions between those in the law field, their clients, and the public or customers their clients serve. By focusing on these experts’ thoughts described above, you can either begin moving in this direction or strengthen your existing connections as a modern lawyer.

At my firm, I was trained to do a responsible direct examination:  Questions should not be leading. Questions should not be compound. Questions should not call for narrative answers. For the most part, don’t do things that are objectionable.

Then you try a case.

The lawyer on the other side opens every direct examination of fact witnesses with this question: “Please tell us a little about yourself — where you were born, where you grew up, where you went to school.”

That question’s an outrage! It’s compound! It calls for a narrative answer! How dare he!

But you really shouldn’t object.

Objecting to this question would make you look like a jerk. Why wouldn’t you let the witness give a little basic background information? It’s true you could (if the judge were leaning your way) make the witness break down the information into parts: Where were you born? Where did you grow up? Where did you go to high school? Where did you go to college?

But why?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
You’d look silly insisting on this. The background information is relevant. There’s unlikely to be a dispute about it. It takes less time to present this as a narrative than it does to do this in question-and-answer form. You might as well let the witness provide the information.

It’s also a great question from the perspective of the lawyer doing the direct examination.

The lawyer doing the direct wants the witness to become comfortable in the jury box. The lawyer wants the jury to get a sense of the witness as a person. Letting the witness speak about basic information for a minute or two at the beginning of the testimony serves those purposes.

To heck with what they taught you at school or in your law firm.

Open your direct examination of every fact witness with: “Please tell us a little about yourself — where you were born, where you grew up, where you went to school.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
(Note that the question asks the witness to “tell us,” rather than to “tell the jury.” That’s just basic psychology. You want to be on the jury’s side: We’re all in this together; we all have to get educated; please tell us what the answers are. You don’t want to build a wall between yourself and the jury: “I’m smart and already know the answers to all of these questions. But those foolish jurors don’t know anything. Why don’t you tell the jury the answers to these questions; I’ll just stand around waiting for you to finish.”)

Here’s another thing you learn from experience: At your firm, you’re told to be perfect in front of a jury. Never make a mistake. The performance before the jury must make you look like a skilled surgeon; everything is studied in advance and carried out to perfection. No errors.

Then you watch a good cross-examiner in action:

“Let’s see. You were paid $10 million under the first contract and $10 million under the second contract. I’m not so good at math. So what’s that? Ten million plus ten million equals $30 million in total?”

“Objection!  The arithmetic is wrong!”

The jury, now awake and paying attention because there’s some action in the courtroom, looks up to see what’s causing the commotion.

“Oh, I’m sorry.  You’re right.  There were actually three contracts. I forgot about the third one. So it’s 10 plus 10 plus another 10, for a total of $30 million. The defendant cheated you out of $30 million. Is that right?”

I saw one clever counsel do this repeatedly throughout trial. The other side never caught on. The arithmetic was always wrong; the other side always objected to counsel’s arithmetic; the jury always looked up; and counsel always “corrected” himself in a way that improved his case.

Don’t fall for it. Some errors are intentional.

One last thought: Sneak in the objectionable, but interesting, stuff when no one is paying attention.

At a trial in the 1980s, I watched this:

“Where did you go to college?”

“Harvard.”

“When did you graduate?”

“1940.”

“Wasn’t that about the time President Kennedy was there?”

“Oh, yeah. Jack Kennedy and I were co-captains of the sailing team.”

“Objection! Irrelevant!”

“Sustained. The jury will disregard the answer to the last question.”

Jury: This witness was co-captain of the Harvard sailing team with JFK? That’s a little Preppie, but what a cool guy! I’ll listen very closely to, and tend to believe, what he has to say.

They don’t tell you that stuff in your trial practice classes.

Kirkland may now be the [largest law firm in New York](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/the-100-largest-law-firms-in-new-york-2022/), but Paul Weiss — which had long held that title in prior years — sure is trying to get payback in its latest lateral raid of the highest-grossing Biglaw firm in the world, both within and outside of the U.S.

As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/14/paul-weiss-raid-on-kirkland-encompases-more-corporate-partners-in-us-and-uk/), more than 10 partners — including three whose books of business are “rumored [to be] in the nine-figure range” — have recently departed Kirkland for Paul Weiss. Here are some additional details:

Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison’s raid of Kirkland & Ellis this month includes a four-partner London team led by private equity giant Neel Sachdev as well as other partners in the U.S. and U.K., a team that could number more than 10 lawyers in all.

Sources confirmed that Paul Weiss has also hired Kirkland debt finance partner Eric Wedel, who had been with the firm for almost 17 years, working out of New York and Los Angeles. It’s anticipated that Wedel will bring a team of three or four partners with him, sources said.

Meanwhile, Roger Johnson, a mergers and acquisitions partner in London who left Kirkland earlier this month, will also likely join Paul Weiss, with his team of partners, in short order, sources said.

Meanwhile, Kirkland conducted its own raid of the Paul Weiss London outpost this month, so this back-and-forth between the dueling firms may not be ending any time soon.

# Law Firm Raises Salaries For Young Associates, Senior Associates Left To Wonder
## These associates might be getting raises. Or they might not.

By and large, black box compensation models exist because employers believe, in a clumsy effort to be “cagey,” that keeping employees from knowing how their pay stacks up to those around them will allow the company to short-change employees on a widespread basis. The logic is that an employee told that their vague “performance” put them below par will be too ashamed to admit it to anyone else and just assume that everyone else is making more money… prompting the employee to redouble their efforts to chase a raise that will probably never come. Employers get the most out of their workers while paying as little as possible. The panopticon of comp.

Other employers are just naive and really believe their vapid “performance-based incentives” lingo — an almost impossibly dumb worldview in the law firm setting because associates are already as motivated as they’ll ever be by the quest for partnership.

Whatever the motivation, Foley Hoag is moving forward with a black box model for its older associates but is announcing raises for the junior lawyers who’ve been sweating out the last month.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In a memo, the firm outlined some lockstep raises:

1Y $190,000
2Y $200,000
3Y $220,000

That’s a match of the Milbank/Cravath scale. But after that…

For more senior associates, and all others, while most people are receiving a salary increase, we have continued our long-standing practice of making individualized compensation decisions based on performance. We will also continue to pay individualized bonuses, at year-end, based on performance.

Most people may be getting a raise. But maybe not you specifically. Classic black box.

That last line is also a passive-aggressive way of saying, “Oh, and we’re definitely not giving the Simpson bonuses so please don’t ask.”

So… mixed news at Foley Hoag? Congratulations, I guess.

# Finding Your Own Career Happiness And Path To Success In Law

Ed. note: Please welcome Wendi Weiner to our pages. She will be writing about how attorneys can achieve successful careers, both inside and outside of the law.

At my law school graduation, my mom handed me a copy of Dr Seuss’ “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” Inside the book cover, she wrote, “You have just started to reach your shining star. Hold on to it tightly. The adventure has just begun.”

I held those words close to my heart over the next 12 years. My legal career would be filled with winding roads, unknown detours, and new paths. It would also be met with failures, do-overs, and new beginnings. It was all part of the adventure, after all.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I believed that career happiness in law was contingent on becoming partner at a prestigious law firm, only I had no desire to make partner. The pattern of thought was ingrained in me since OCIs (on-campus interviews) in my 2L year. As a result, for much of my legal career, I felt lost, unfulfilled, and scared.

In 2011, I entered the lottery for the New York City Marathon on a whim after having dinner with a friend from college. I expected it to be a several-year process of entering, only to soon realize I would be picked on the first application. At the time, I had reached the highest peak of frustration in my legal career. The 2008 recession ravaged the legal industry. It also caused my physical health to deteriorate on a downward spiral.

I took the challenge of running a marathon as an opportunity to rechannel my attention and direction, thinking that running would give me time to think, process, and reflect on my career while also giving me a new lease on a healthier life. I expected to find the answers on the long, lonely roads and trails as a back-of-the-pack runner. So, I did what any newbie runner would do after getting into the lottery for the New York City Marathon: I joined an advanced running group. Most people would have quit knowing they needed to begin training at 4:30 a.m. on a Saturday, but I was ready for the challenge.

On one Saturday morning, my running coach ran up beside me. I remember mumbling to her, “This is really hard.”  She turned to me and said, “Of course it’s hard. Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” It hit me like a ton of bricks. I had been living life and my career within my comfort zone for a long time — fearing risk, failure, and anything that didn’t seem linear. Why was I so afraid of doing something different?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I kept her voice and that statement in my mind at mile 20 of the marathon, and continuing through miles 22, and 24 when the race really began. My body was on empty, but my mind was stronger than I ever felt before — stronger than any job rejection, stronger than any difficult opposing counsel, and stronger than any frustration about my legal career. The day I crossed that finish line, my mindset about my legal career changed forever — in fact, it gave me the confidence to leave law several years later and pursue my own career happiness as a writer and coach.

We often question our skills, our abilities, and even our career if things aren’t linear. Yet, finding your own unique path to success in law (or in an alternative legal career) can be the best thing that ever happened to you. You can regain a sense of self-confidence that was hidden or buried. You can find joy in the freedom of new opportunity, new goals, and new roads.

It takes years of rising and falling to keep spinning the wheel with ideas. It takes the ultimate amount of self-confidence and perseverance when you are in the toughest miles of the marathon. It takes an infinite strength to close your ears to the negative noise of others who doubt you or who say it can’t be done.

Crossing a marathon finish line and finding your inner courage is a powerful thing. It gives you faith, hope, and determination. It opens your eyes to the possibilities that exist within you and the potential that still lingers.

The other day, I opened the book and turned to the last page.

# Am Law 100 Firms To Close On Election Day To Get Out The Vote
## Will your firm offer a paid holiday to support voting rights across America?

With Election 2020 just a few months out and voter suppression efforts a great concern amid the continuing coronavirus crisis, it’s important for large law firms to do their best to make sure their employees perform their civic duty and vote and volunteer to help others do the same. Several law firms have already made commitments to do just that.

Earlier this week, Fenwick & West announced that it would be rolling out a Voting Rights Initiative where it would provide all employees with a [paid civic holiday on Election Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-firm-announces-election-day-will-be-a-paid-holiday/), designed to allow employees the time to vote and volunteer. According to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/18/mintz-fenwick-announce-paid-day-off-structures-to-aid-voter-turnout-in-2020-election-will-others-follow/), Mintz is doing the same thing, and will be giving all of its employees a paid day off to vote and volunteer to get out the vote on November 3. “It isn’t unusual for firms to give a couple of hours at the beginning or end of the day,” said managing partner [Bob Bodian](https://www.mintz.com/our-people/robert-i-bodian). “[B]ut I didn’t see anything where firms were giving the whole day.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We’ve recently learned that yet another Biglaw firm will be closing its doors on Election Day to increase voter turnout. Orrick is instituting a day of service on November 3. Here’s an excerpt from an email about the the firm’s commitment to voting rights that was sent out earlier this week (available in full on the next page):

[T]o help ensure each of you and your families are able to vote – and to provide you with the option of doing a day of service – our firm will be closed in the United States on Election Day, November 3, 2020. If you decide to use the day for community service, please choose any kind of pro bono work or volunteerism that is meaningful to you (the needs are many and acute across our communities). For anyone who would like ideas for how to work on voter registration and poll access, we are collaborating with our Public Policy and Supreme Court & Appellate groups and Rene Kathawala to assemble a list of local opportunities and resources that we will share soon. Of course, you can do this service on any day (although November 3 is the day we will designate as off for this purpose). And, we would greatly value hearing from you about your volunteer experience and what you take away from it.

We hope that our collective efforts make an impact by helping to ensure the voices and votes of all Americans, regardless of political views or affiliations, are counted and heard.

As with most Biglaw trends, we’ll be tracking exactly which firms are giving time off for employees to do their civic duty. If your firm is giving time off for Election Day or otherwise supporting voting rights, let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Election%20Day) or text us (646-820-8477).

# Law Firm Inadvertently Gives Pedophile Video Of Child In Unrelated Case
## This story took a bizarre turn.

There are discovery snafus and then there are EPIC fuck-ups — this case falls squarely in the later category.

It all started when police in Kent, England, executed a search warrant on the home of Daryll Taylor. They discovered indecent images of children, which led to Taylor’s conviction. However, the incident also spurred a lawsuit by Taylor against police for damage to his door. The Chief Constable of Kent hired the BLM law firm — now a part of the international Biglaw firm Clyde & Co — to defend the claim, and discovery took place before the claim was ultimately dismissed.

During discovery, Taylor was granted access to a file sharing tool, Collaborate. And that’s where the heart of the problem lies — “for technical reasons which are not clear,” Taylor was also granted access to videos of a child in another case which depicted their arrest, search, and interview.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Taylor contacted the law firm about his unexpected access, but when they asked him to delete the materials he downloaded, he [responded](https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/kb/2023/2687) in “what can fairly be described as somewhat bizarre responses including demands for monetary payment of several thousand pounds.”

The firm obtained a court order to get Taylor to delete the materials he was inadvertently granted access to. But, as [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/blm-accidentally-gave-videos-child-pedophile) RollOnFriday, Taylor’s reaction was positively obstinate.

Taylor ignored court orders to delete the videos and permit IT experts to inspect his devices and when BLM pressed him to comply, he emailed the firm a curt response: “Fuck off and die”.

A second attempt elicited a longer, but no more helpful, reply: “Fuck you, fuck your company, fuck the courts and fuck London I hope you all die Souless [sic] drones Yours sincerely Daryll Taylor”

BLM’s third try earned a one word email: “Die”.

Clyde & Co, which had by that time taken over BLM, fared little better when it took a shot at the problem. “Do not contact me again, and die in the most painful way possible you filthy parasite”, Taylor responded.

Taylor has no-showed for a court hearing on the matter, and was held in contempt. Taylor is due back in court for sentencing.

# Biglaw Partners: Are You Capturing A Fair Share Of Your Revenue?

If you are a Biglaw partner, you may have heard this compensation rule of thumb: you should be taking home a third of the revenue you generate for the firm. The 33% rule has the advantage of being simple, and it makes for a reasonable starting point. But to really know whether you are capturing a fair share of the value you create, it’s important to consider some other factors.

Your hours vs. your team’s hours

The first distinction you’ll want to make is between the hours you bill and those billed by the people working for you, such as associates and service partners. The 33% rule is supposed to apply to all revenue for which you are responsible. But we can make things more precise by breaking that revenue into two segments.

As a general rule, you should make about 40% of revenue from hours you billed personally. As for the hours billed by members of your team, it depends how profitable those lawyers are for the firm. Associates at some firms are substantially more profitable than others. The more profitable your associates, and the more leverage your book has, the greater the share of your team’s revenue you can expect to take home.

RPL and leverage are the key metrics

To understand what share of team revenue should accrue to you, consider how your firm stacks up on two key metrics: revenue per lawyer (RPL) and leverage.

RPL is critical because it is so poorly correlated with associate salaries. You could imagine a different compensation model in which firms paid associates a standard share of the revenue they generated, either individually or on average across the firm. But as we know, that isn’t how this industry works. Instead, all top-tier firms pay associates more or less the same salaries based on class year. As a result, partners at firms with relatively high RPL get to divide a much larger profit pool than partners at “top” firms with low RPL.

Within the Am Law 100, the spread between high and low RPL is striking. Firms at the low end have RPL of around $500,000. For example, Lewis Brisbois is the lowest of the Am Law 100, at $448,000. Firms at the high end have RPL around 4X that of the low-end firms. Sullivan & Cromwell, for example, clocks in above $2.2 million. (Wachtell is in a league of its own, with RPL in excess of $3.8 million.) Granted, a Sullivan & Cromwell associate earns higher total compensation than a Lewis Brisbois lawyer in the same class year, but that multiple is nowhere near 4X.

Now, RPL isn’t everything. We also have to consider leverage. If a partner’s book can feed a relatively large number of associates, the proportion of the team’s revenue that should accrue to the rainmaking partner will be higher. And to be fair to Lewis Brisbois, their partnership is doing well on that dimension, with leverage of 9.99 (third-highest among the Am Law 100).

Let’s take a look at leverage for the top 10 firms by RPL:

Firm	RPL ($ millions)	Leverage
Wachtell	3.860	2.2
Sullivan & Cromwell	2.215	3.8
Cravath	2.035	4.1
Kirkland	1.997	5.2
Ropes & Gray	1.950	4.1
Davis Polk	1.923	5.4
Simpson Thacher	1.913	4.7
Quinn Emanuel	1.839	4.2
Skadden	1.838	4.1
Paul Weiss	1.836	5.0
We see that Kirkland and Davis Polk are outperforming on leverage, which is good news for their equity partners. And in fact this flows through to the profits per equity partner (PEP) ranking: although Sullivan & Cromwell outranks Kirkland and Davis Polk on RPL, it is behind those firms in profits per equity partner. (Wachtell is first in both categories.)

Firm	PEP ($ millions)
Wachtell	8.400
Kirkland	7.388
Davis Polk	7.010
Sullivan & Cromwell	6.366
Ambitious associates who are aiming for partnership should be aware of the importance of leverage in modeling their future expected compensation. To take another example, Gibson Dunn is immediately ahead of Paul Hastings and Weil Gotshal on the RPL ranking. But Gibson’s leverage is on the low end: 3.4. Because Paul Hastings and Weil have better leverage, they comfortably beat Gibson in PEP.

Firm	RPL ($ millions)	Leverage	PEP ($ millions)
Gibson Dunn	1.613	3.4	4.400
Paul Hastings	1.606	4.5	4.703
Weil Gotshal	1.573	5.5	5.181
How does your practice compare to the firm average?

Your firm’s overall RPL and leverage are important considerations, but unless the partnership has a pure lockstep compensation model, the performance of your practice relative to the firm average is also critical. A good starting point for thinking about this dimension is to compare the firm’s profit margin to the share of your revenue that you are taking home. For example, let’s say your firm’s profit margin is 45%. Are you being paid 45% of the revenue you are generating?

If not, consider how your practice may differ from others in the firm. Does it have lower leverage than the firm average? Are you personally billing fewer hours than your peers in the partnership? If the answer to both of these questions is no, then your compensation should reflect the firm profit margin. If it doesn’t, you are likely underpaid, and you may want to consider your options.

Government attorneys are in demand, and several prominent law firms have recently hired former government attorneys. If you are a government attorney considering a transition to the private sector, understanding how to leverage your background to strengthen your candidacy is crucial. Here are a few tips to strengthen your Biglaw prospects.

Develop High-Level Expertise

Many attorneys are drawn to government practice not just to serve the public, but also to take on high levels of responsibility earlier in their career than attorneys in private practice. The higher the level of responsibility you have handled, the more attractive you will be to most law firms. Seize opportunities to lead projects, appear in court, negotiate settlements, craft new rules, attend training sessions – your advanced skills will set you apart from the competition.

Also, seek out an experience that gives you a unique insight into government policies and priorities. Firms and clients appreciate that insight because you will be able to help them more effectively navigate (what seems to be constantly evolving) legal frameworks.

You may also be able to leverage your expertise to earn promotions, which may make you more appealing to potential firms, especially at the partner level. Senior positions also enhance your credibility with future clients.

Build Relationships

This is one of the most rewarding aspects of practicing law for many attorneys. It is also crucial for government attorneys who are interested in partnership options. Firms appreciate your relationships in part because they demonstrate that you are thinking ahead about developing business, and that you are honing the soft skills needed to build a successful practice.

So where do you build these relationships as a government attorney? While you are not in a position to wine and dine potential clients, you still have a universe of options. Start by fostering relationships with your government colleagues. If your colleagues leave they may become clients if they move in house, or referral sources when they join other firms. You also have opportunities to build relationships with professionals you meet at government events, departmental training sessions, and conferences. Consider joining the ABA Government and Public Sector Lawyers Division to meet even more people. Even working across the table from opposing counsel presents the opportunity to get to know key players in your space.

Focus on Relevant Practice Areas

If your long-term goal is a move to private practice, focus on a practice area that not only inspires you but also aligns with the kind of firm you want to join. You will have more options if you are interested in areas where top firms have thriving practices. For 2024, we predict that litigation, antitrust, white-collar, corporate, energy, and intellectual property will continue to thrive. In contrast, specializing in niche areas like First Amendment law may limit the range of options available to you. That said, you will ultimately commit to one firm. Therefore, the volume of exit opportunities might be just one factor for you to consider.

Plan Ahead

Strategically planning ahead increases the likelihood of a successful search. Not only does it take time to craft persuasive application materials, but you also need to take the market for government attorneys into consideration. This year, for instance, it is important to be mindful of the electoral cycle. A surge of government candidates after elections can lead to heightened competition. Positions may also be limited at that point; historically, many firms complete their searches for government attorneys well before an election.

You also need time to find the firms that align with your practice areas, work style, and personal and professional goals. A legal recruiter who has deep relationships with firms can help you on that front; they will know which practices are thriving, which firms are hiring, and can play a pivotal role in guiding you to the firms with platforms that best match your aspirations. The earlier you reach out to a recruiter, the better they will be able to help you with your search.

# Biglaw Firms Are Hiring Remote Associates In This Post-Pandemic World
## The market for associate talent is so hot right now that firms will hire them wherever they may be.

As more and more firms announce their plans to bring associates back to their newly reopened offices on hybrid schedules, at the same time, more and more firms are hiring associates who will be completely remote. This hiring trend just goes to show that flexibility is key in the new normal.

Firms are seeking talent in markets outside of their office locations partly due to the recent skyrocketing demand for associates, particularly in areas such as corporate work and intellectual property. The pandemic pushed many young lawyers out of Big Law or the profession entirely, adding to the crunch.

“Firms came out of the doldrums and they’re raring to go,” said Andrew Glynn, a recruiter and managing director with Major, Lindsey & Africa’s associate practice group. “They’re hiring at a rate that I have not seen in five years.”

Firms like Husch Blackwell, Orrick, and Perkins Coie already employed attorneys outside of their existing office spaces, but after the past 15 months, they’ve been inspired to onboard even more remote employees. How’s that been going?

At Orrick, they’re creating a commission to put in place policies for a virtual office to create structure for more remote associate hires. Siobhan Handley, the firm’s chief talent officer, noted in an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/10/more-large-law-firms-are-embracing-remote-associate-hires/) that the firm’s last five new partner classes included attorneys who lived and worked in places without Orrick offices. “We were ahead of the game in knowing that physical presence in an office does not equate to success,” she said. “Now there’s a lot more widespread appetite for it.”

Over at Perkins Coie, chief talent officer Jennifer Bluestein says she recently approved remote associate offers in several different states. “Matters and clients require us to work across offices anyway, so dictating where we hire someone seems to be a fairly artificial construct,” she said. “That doesn’t mean we’re ready to hire for every position in any state. But we’re not going to say, ‘You’re in X state, we’re not going to talk to you.’”

Husch Blackwell, after announcing the [opening of its virtual office](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/am-law-100-firm-launches-work-from-anywhere-virtual-office/) (referred to as “The Link”) in July 2020, now has 57 attorneys working remotely without a home office. “It’s a tremendous opportunity to open up our pipeline of new talent and cast a wider net than ever before,” [products liability partner J.Y.] Miller, who serves as managing partner of the new office, told Am Law. “When we post positions now and post them for The Link, we’re getting resumes from people all over the country. It’s really opened up a new level of talent and interest.”

With associate hiring all the rage, will your firm be hiring remote employees?

# NRA May Be Shooting Itself In The Foot With Out-Of-Control Legal Bills
## Bill Brewer's apparently charging them $97K a day.

The NRA appears to be in utter disarray. They’ve had a [failed palace coup](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/business/nra-wayne-lapierre-oliver-north.html), state regulators are [closing in](https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/new-york-ag-investigating-nra-foundation-s-ties-to-lobbying-group), and the group is openly admitting that [they’re running out of money](https://nypost.com/2018/08/03/nra-says-its-broke-and-on-the-verge-of-collapse/). A key factor in all of these problems may be their lawyer, Bill Brewer.

Brewer is known for his tenacity, but NRA insiders are starting to wonder if Brewer’s zealousness is driving the organization toward bankruptcy. A new ProPublica report dishes on some [hefty legal bills over at Gun Central](https://www.propublica.org/article/william-brewer-new-documents-raise-ethical-billing-concerns-about-nra-outside-counsel).

The statement [from former senior employee, Emily Cummins] lays out a list of allegations regarding Brewer’s legal work and his treatment of NRA staff as questions surfaced about his law firm’s billings, which totaled $24 million over a 13-month period. In the first quarter of 2019, Brewer’s firm charged over $97,000 per day, according to internal NRA documents [posted](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/nra-documents-reveal-brewer-law-firm-spending-lapierre-expense-details/) anonymously online.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Normally, stories about how much attorneys charge are little more than pearl-clutching overreactions. But $97K every single day is actually eye-popping.

“I witnessed what appeared to be unrealistic and duplicative billing from Bill Brewer,” Cummins wrote. “I witnessed that Bill Brewer himself created a 2018 cash flow crunch by interfering with accounts payable to prioritize paying himself immediately versus other NRA vendors that had been providing goods or services for months without payment, also jeopardizing the NRA’s biweekly staff payroll.”

I doubt the bills were “unrealistic and duplicative” but there’s definitely room to be overaggressive that lay observers might perceive as duplicative. Still, Brewer is [no stranger to getting sanctioned](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/federal-judge-wants-to-hear-why-bigtime-attorney-said-hed-never-been-sanctioned-when-he-was-totally-just-sanctioned/), so it’s easy for people to jump to the least charitable read of a hefty bill.

This month, four NRA board members publicly called for an “independent review of the millions of dollars in payments to Brewer, Attorneys & Counselors for legal fees.” But other NRA senior officials continue to defend the group. Carolyn Meadows, the NRA’s president, told ProPublica, “I have never worked with an outside law firm that is more on call, attentive and positively in tune to the needs of their client.” Charles Cotton, the NRA’s first vice president and chairman of the audit committee, added that Cummins’ allegations “reflect a misinformed view of the Brewer firm, its billings, and its advocacy for the NRA.”

Former NRA President Oliver North was one of those seeking an audit of Brewer’s bills. He got wished into the cornfields for his efforts. No matter how much internal pressure bubbles up against Brewer’s billings, the NRA’s core leadership unit is steadfast in its support.

And they sound like they will be all the way to the poor house.

Earlier today, Willkie Farr & Gallagher announced via email to its associates that the firm would be matching the Cravath bonus scale. Coincidentally, tonight is the firm’s annual holiday party. There’s nothing like a Biglaw firm that knows how to make a party extra festive. Congratulations!

According to the bonus memo (available on the next page), Willkie’s bonuses will land in associates’ bank accounts on December 22, the Friday before Christmas.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us at 646-820-8477. We look forward to hearing from you.

# Kids (Of Supreme Court Justices) Say The Darnedest Things
## Eugene Scalia has a curious theory about who's to blame for the dearth of Biglaw conservatives.

Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia appeared at a Federalist Society event, probably because he heard they had free pizza, and told attendees that Biglaw is suffering from a “self-censorship” problem because as we all know, if there’s one group of people who are shy with sharing their opinions, it’s the lawyers.

The former Gibson Dunn partner posited a universe where conservative attorneys abound but are almost undetectable as if they’re f**king dark matter or something. While [cold, hard numbers exist proving that this is a lie](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/campaign-donation-figures-confirm-that-lawyers-really-really-dont-like-trump/), Scalia soldiered on bemoaning a Biglaw culture that just doesn’t let this mythical silent majority spread its wings and he knows who to blame!

Capitalism.

Wha?

“One factor preventing that in these and other cases is self-censorship. Our elite law firms are hesitant to get involved in cases that might generate criticism from the left of center or that might conflict with views that other lawyers in the firm hold personally,” he continued. “Secondly, firms fear repercussions from certain well-heeled corporate clients if they take positions disfavored by progressives. And sadly there’s reason for that concern.”

I’m old enough to remember when Republicans believed the free market solved everything. Now it’s apparently a travesty that big corporations care about their customers enough to actually embrace causes popular with the majority of the country. Not that big business should dictate morality — they can and do take horrific stances all the time — but it’s truly wild to hear someone allegedly “pro-business” complaining that businesses serving the market is bad.

“Today a corporation accused of environmental crimes objects to a lawyer at its outside law firm filing a brief in support of the unborn,” Scalia said. “Tomorrow, why can’t someone schooled in today’s ‘cancel culture’ use the same logic to attack the firm for defending that company’s environmental depredations.”

Again, “cancel culture” is just a trendy conservative slur for “the free market.” Tomorrow, another corporation could use the same logic to attack a firm for representing another company committing environmental crimes. Disney’s brand may not want to be tied to poisoning Bambi’s neighborhood. Sure, legally the accused is entitled to a defense, but professionally the firm is well within its rights to assess whether or not it’s in its best interest to lose other clients over that fight. Conservatives act like that’s some sort of treachery as opposed to how business works. Indeed, it’s exactly how conservatives long tried to influence the world — they just eventually realized they lack the market power to destroy Oprah for voting for Obama.

Welcome to the same ongoing pity party as those FedSoc professors who bellyache about how law schools [should offer affirmative action for the minority of scholars who think voting rights are overrated](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/conservative-profs-want-viewpoint-diversity-which-is-kinda-racist/) as opposed to, say, actual minorities. Or the [Harvard dweebs demanding more right-wing clinics](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/harvard-fedsoc-demands-right-wing-clinics-cause-i-guess-helping-poor-people-is-liberal/). That they’d blame just about anyone but themselves for their own unpopularity isn’t a shock. But going after “well-heeled corporate clients” as antagonists marks a bold extension of the Steve Bannon populism playbook.

From Antonin Scalia defending corporate free speech rights to Eugene Scalia complaining about corporations using their speech to support DACA. It’s been a wild few years.

# Is The Problem With The Writer Or The Reader?

One of your colleagues at your law firm prepared an exhibit for use at trial.  The exhibit is a timeline where you’ll run through a series of items to build the timeline before the jury’s eyes. You ask your expert witness to comment on the timeline.

“I don’t understand the fourth entry. What are we trying to say there?”

“You’re right. I don’t understand that entry either. Let me talk to my colleague and get back to you.”

The sixth entry on the timeline poses problems, too. The expert can’t understand it. But you can: “Oh! I know what that one means.” And you go on to give a 30-second explanation of what the entry means.

A partner looks at a draft brief. The partner circles a sentence and writes:  “I’m not sure what this means. What are we driving at?”

When you next see the partner, you explain what the sentence means.

What’s the problem in all of these scenarios?

Your reaction is wrong.

If you, or someone else, doesn’t understand what’s trying to be communicated in a written document, then it’s not your fault. It’s the writer’s fault. The words are no good. The words shouldn’t be explained; they should be rewritten to be comprehensible.

In my first scenario, where neither you nor the expert understands the entry in a timeline, what are the odds that a judge or jury will understand what’s being said — zero in a hundred, or zero in a thousand?

If, as in my second scenario, only your expert doesn’t understand the words, what’s the chance that you’re communicating with a person of average intelligence? Your expert is presumably of above-average intelligence. Your expert knows what the case is about. And your expert doesn’t understand what’s being said. Your expert wins: Rewrite the entry.

Perhaps you can explain the entry. Or perhaps, as in my third scenario, you can explain what a sentence in a brief means — because you wrote the sentence, and it would be remarkable if you couldn’t explain words that you had written.

So what?

The idea is not for a person with intimate knowledge of your case to be able to understand your words. The idea is for a person of average intelligence with little or no knowledge of your case — that is, an overworked judge or a bored jury — to instantaneously grasp the meaning of the words. If the words require explanation, the words have flunked that test. Period.

So, as I asked in the title to this column: Is the problem with the writer or the reader? Unless you think that your reader is far below average in intelligence, and so your reader’s reaction is unreasonable, the reader is always right, and the writer is always wrong.

If people don’t understand things, do not explain those things. Rather, rewrite them, so that the words explain themselves.

# Biglaw Firm Encourages All Employees To Use Gender Pronouns In Email Signatures
## This is a move that goes far in setting the tone of inclusion at law firms.

Biglaw firms continue to promote diversity and inclusion among their ranks by instituting transgender-friendly workplace policies. To that end, many firms have decided to embrace the full gender spectrum by encouraging any and all employees — not just their transgender, genderqueer, gender fluid, and nonbinary employees — to use gender pronouns in their email signatures.

We can now add one more firm to the constantly growing list of those that have offered approval and support for employees to add their gender pronouns to their email signature blocks.

Kramer Levin recently announced that as part of the firm’s commitment to creating and maintaining an inclusive work environment — and in honor of Transgender Day of Remembrance — it would offer employees an optional, standardized mechanism for sharing gender pronouns in their email signature blocks. For those who opt to add pronouns to their email signature block, the word “pronouns” will be hyperlinked to the Human Rights Campaign’s fact sheet on “Talking About Pronouns in the Workplace,” available [here](https://www.thehrcfoundation.org/professional-resources/talking-about-pronouns-in-the-workplace).

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In support of this move, Nada Llewellyn, the firm’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, said, “Normalizing the use of personal pronouns and sharing them publicly is one way to create a more inclusive environment for our LGBTQ+ community members and reduces the possibility of misgendering our colleagues.”

This is a remarkably simple move, but one that goes pretty far in normalizing the practice and setting the tone of inclusion. Does your firm support the usage of gender pronouns in email signatures? Please let us know.

# Applying AI To Legal Recruiting: New Tools For Efficiently Matching Firms And Candidates
## Discover how Haistack.AI is revolutionizing legal recruiting by efficiently identifying high-potential candidates and streamlining the hiring process.

With everyone talking about ChatGPT and the implications of AI tools for the future of various professions, now is an opportune time to consider how AI might change legal recruiting. We at Lateral Link have been actively engaging with this question for years: in fact, we have a sister company called [Haistack.AI](https://haistack.ai) that is developing AI products for the legal recruiting industry.

So for the latest episode of the [Movers, Shakers & Rainmakers podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-38-artificial-intelligence-ai-the-legal-world/id1604244555?i=1000604184838), we invited Haistack.AI Chief Technology Officer [Michael Heise](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-heise-b55b4b6/) to discuss the possibilities and limitations of AI for law firms and legal recruiters. Mike educated us on the likely implications of AI for our industry and described the logic behind the product that Haistack.AI is currently building.

Mike is a seasoned legal tech innovator with a deep understanding of Biglaw firms. Prior to joining Haistack.AI, Mike held software leadership roles at Cooley and Covington & Burling. As he explained on the podcast, he is married to an attorney, and it was his wife who first sparked his interest in legal sector innovation.


AI can be a valuable tool 

Mike explained that AI has the potential to assist lawyers with a broad range of tasks. For example, a litigator could rely on AI tools to set out the basic structure of a brief, allowing the lawyer to dedicate more of her time to the higher-value tasks of refining arguments and tailoring them to be most persuasive based on the unique facts of the case. As Mike puts it: “AI is not going to replace you. The person who knows how to effectively use AI is going to replace you.” AI tools will become increasingly sophisticated, but human judgment will remain essential for crafting the strongest and most original arguments.

Similarly, AI is well suited to help recruiters — both within firms and outside them — to more efficiently identify high-potential candidates. By reducing the time a recruiter spends on manually trawling through candidate profiles, AI can enable the recruiter to gain a deeper understanding of the high-potential candidate pool and the relative strengths of the candidates within that pool.

The Haistack.AI vision

As an example of how AI promises to make recruiting more targeted and efficient, Mike described the product that the team at Haistack.AI is building. It entails creating three essential models: (1) profiles of lawyers currently working at the firm that is using Haistack.AI in its hiring process; (2) profiles of lawyers working outside that firm; and (3) profiles corresponding to the specific roles for which the firm is recruiting. By comparing the profiles of lawyers previously hired by the relevant practice group and office with the profiles of external lawyers, the algorithm can instantly generate a list of high-potential candidates and an explanation for why those candidates appear to be a good fit. Moreover, the AI will use Lateral Link data to screen out candidates whom the firm has previously considered and determined not to be a fit. Finally, the tool will give some indication of the extent to which the leading candidates are likely to be in demand at other firms seeking to fill similar vacancies, alerting the hiring firm to the need to move quickly where a candidate is likely to be in especially high demand.

With the assistance of the Haistack.AI tool, the recruiter managing the search will immediately see how the algorithm matched a candidate’s qualifications and experience to those of current members of the group. This is where human judgment comes in. The AI accelerates the first step of identifying a shortlist, but the law firm’s recruiting and attorney professionals must assess whether the shortlist fits their needs, through interviews and other more traditional evaluations.

Mike noted that in addition to generating lists of promising candidates, the Haistack.AI tool could also help identify current members of a firm who are in especially high demand relative to what the broader lateral market is seeking. In alerting a firm to attorneys who are at greater risk of leaving, the tool can help nudge a practice group to be more proactive about taking steps to keep valuable team members happy.

AI is not a panacea

Mike also explained the importance of recognizing the limitations of AI and of not buying into the excessive hype that frequently surrounds promising technologies in their early stages. AI will not solve all hiring problems. To take just one example, the inputs for AI models like the ones that Haistack.AI are building are composed of historical data — the models are designed to replicate the firm’s past hiring decisions. To the extent the past hiring was suboptimal, such as through failing to hire qualified diverse candidates, the AI tool will not correct the problem. Instead, it is important for the human users to be thoughtful about patterns in past hiring that they do not wish to replicate and make an active effort to change them.

As we [mentioned](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/morning-docket-07-13-16/) earlier this week, the only person [who’s a winner](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/business/media/27lawsuit.html?_r=0) at Nixon Peabody right now is former associate Noah Doolittle. Back in 2009, Doolittle filed suit against the firm for breach of contract, fraud and deceit, and misrepresentation, alleging that he’d been promised a bonus worth five percent of the $5.32 million in fees Nixon Peabody collected from aTelo Inc., a client he’d brought in to the firm. Doolittle thought that he’d be receiving a bonus in the ballpark of $266,000; much to his chagrin, he received a bonus of only $75,000. It turns out that Nixon Peabody should have paid up, because after seven years in court, Doolittle won his case, and now the firm may owe him up to $1 million.

The [Daily Record](http://nydailyrecord.com/2016/07/12/former-associate-wins-lawsuit-against-nixon-peabody-that-could-cost-the-firm-1-million/) (sub. req.) has more information on the jury verdict that was reached:

In a verdict reached on June 20, the former associate, Noah Doolittle, was awarded $265,926, said Doolittle’s lawyer, Nelson Thomas.

The jury also found that Nixon Peabody had violated New York state labor law and therefore must pay Doolittle an additional penalty, Thomas said.

“My guess is, with interest, it’s somewhere between ($400,000) and $500,000 dollars, and then legal fees on top of that. My guess is the legal fees are in excess of $500,000,” he said.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
At trial, Nixon Peabody argued that the larger bonus Doolittle thought he’d earned was “discretionary,” and that no such written policy — one that “promised associates they would receive 5 percent of annual fees above $100,000 that were collected from clients they brought to the firm” — actually existed. A firm spokesperson offered this comment after Doolittle won his case: “While he was employed at Nixon Peabody, the firm paid Mr. Doolittle in accordance with its established salary and bonus policies. We believe Mr. Doolittle was compensated fairly for the work he did in this matter.”

Congratulations to Noah Doolittle on his hard-fought victory and for [being a winner](https://youtu.be/7SeL6i3sHM0)!

# LeClairRyan: Mistiming The End Of The Legal Monopoly
## Leadership at the collapsing Am Law 200 firm pushed all in on a vision of the future that never came to pass.

With LeClairRyan’s dissolution a matter of public record, the battle to control the public narrative is officially underway. Rumors and explanations are proliferating, both publicly and behind closed doors, and many of them should probably be taken with a grain or three of salt. Businesses are complex, and their failures or successes are typically the confluence of dozens of decisions, strategies, and strokes of blind fate.

Two weeks ago, I[ listed a set of themes](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/another-one-bites-the-dust/) I thought would likely emerge in the wake of LeClairRyan’s meltdown. I’ve now had the opportunity to connect with former LeClairRyan partners to get a more crystalized view of what happened. Between this firsthand information and the ample public reporting on LeClairRyan’s demise, it appears that the firm’s leadership suffered from two fatal shortcomings: (i) an inability to make hard decisions, and (ii) a failure to monitor business fundamentals. I’ll do a more comprehensive piece about these points soon.

For now, I’d like to focus on one prediction I got wrong in a very unexpected way. Many law firms collapse due to a failure to anticipate market changes. And some of that was true at LeClairRyan, which evidently failed to monitor market trends in compensation, overhead reduction, and pricing. But ironically, part of LeClairRyan’s failure was the opposite of most firms — namely, anticipating an industry-wide sea change that never materialized.

The Big Bet

[John Fitzpatrick](http://www.wtotrial.com/john-m-fitzpatrick), a former LeClairRyan partner with whom I spoke, explained that firm founder Gary LeClair bet big on the notion that the U.S. would follow in the footsteps of the U.K. in allowing outside, non-lawyer investment in legal services. This is consistent with recent [Bloomberg Law](https://biglawbusiness.com/leclairryans-early-plans-for-outside-investment-came-too-soon) reporting on the subject, which cites other former LeClairRyan partners who wished to remain anonymous.

Back in 2007, the United Kingdom adopted new rules loosening restrictions on the practice of law by non-attorneys. U.K. law firms can now, within certain restrictions, accept outside investment and share firm revenues and fees with non-attorneys. According to Fitzpatrick and the anonymous former partners cited in Bloomberg, LeClair built his firm’s strategy around the prediction that state bars in the U.S. would follow in the U.K.’s footsteps and loosen the unauthorized-practice-of-law and fee-sharing rules.

LeClair concocted an accounting and stock structure within the firm that allowed for the purchase of a preferred class of firm stock that paid an 8 percent return contingent on the firm making budget. In the short term, firm partners theoretically could invest, build up the firm’s capital reservoir, and have a comfortable long-term return on their investment. In the long term, once the rules governing firm investment loosened up, LeClairRyan would be instantly positioned to either accept massive waves of outside funds and grow itself into a superpower, or sell the firm and allow preferred shareholders to cash in. Sounds like a great plan, right?

But to quote famed business management guru Mike Tyson, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.

The U.K.-style loosening of firm ownership rules never made it across the pond. In the meantime, LeClair’s unique preferred stock structure exacerbated the firm’s other business problems. The partnership as a whole, with their common stock shares, were inherently at odds with the subset of partners holding preferred stock, since preferred stock got paid first before common stock once budget was met. Further, the preferred stock investments themselves evidently went to patching budget shortfalls, rather than growing the firm as they should have. Pair those with shrinking revenues and aggressive expansion costs, and you have a partnership class tearing itself apart at the seams.

The results speak for themselves. Gary LeClair gambled on a future that never came to pass, and the firm he founded is no more.

Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained?

LeClair was wrong when it mattered, and it looks like he’s going to remain wrong for the foreseeable future. [I wrote last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/dropping-a-bomb-on-the-legal-monopoly/?rf=1) on the push by the California bar to change its version of the Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL) and fee-sharing rules to follow a more U.K.-centric model allowing for outside investment. California doesn’t care much about opening up law firms to outside investment so much as it is trying to address a critical shortfall in available legal services to consumers. The average lawyer is vastly outside the price range of the average American, and many Californians cannot afford desperately needed legal services. Cracking up some of the bar’s traditional monopoly on those services would invite less-expensive, non-attorney service providers in to help these underserved populations.

The legal profession’s response to this proposal has been nothing short of a torrent of undying fury. [Of the public comments received to date ](http://src.bna.com/Ks2)on the proposals to loosen the rules surrounding UPL in California, I count 14 in favor and 200 against. Only 1 out of 15 comments supported the changes. On loosening fee-sharing restrictions, it was 9 in favor, 48 against, a 5:1 margin against change. Absent bold action by the state bar in outright defiance of the will of its members, or intervention by a state legislature largely comprised of fellow lawyers, the legal monopoly in California will likely remain in place.

Skin In The Game

There are valid arguments against the U.K.-style loosening of the UPL and fee-sharing rules. Lawyers are traditionally entrusted with their clients’ most difficult, sensitive issues, and we’re governed by ethical rules and norms that ensure we keep our clients’ needs ahead of our own. Opening the market to non-attorneys without those safeguards could lead to abuse, especially among the poorest, who need those services the most. Are potentially unethical, predatory legal service providers better than no providers at all?

But let’s not kid ourselves: we lawyers have a deeply personal interest in keeping our monopoly in place, because it’s how we make our money. The market failure California is experiencing is exactly what one would expect a monopoly to create. Demand far exceeds the artificially restricted supply, and the bottom 90 percent are priced out while lawyers make out marvelously.

Also consider how the [Big Four accounting firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/king-kong-is-coming-to-crush-your-practice-with-a-calculator/?rf=1) are waiting in the wings, ready to pour infinite resources and personnel into a crack that might open up in our market. We’re facing financial headwinds as a profession even during an expanding market, and the [bond yield curve just inverted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/14/recession-watch-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-why-does-it-matter/); why would we give up one of the few structural advantages we have going in our favor? People don’t typically vote against their own paychecks. So long as lawyers remain in charge of their own UPL and fee-sharing rules, those rules are probably safe for another generation.

The Future Is When?

The legal monopoly is well protected, both at the state bar level and within state legislatures. It would take either a dramatic shift in bar leadership or a populist uprising in response to the serious shortfalls in the current supply of legal services to see those protections come to an end.

Gary LeClair bet wrong, but it remains to be seen whether it was the substance or timing of that bet that was off. The day may come when outside pressures grow substantial enough to push for a U.K.-style deregulation of the legal market. Or U.S. lawyers may stand firm in keeping our monopoly intact, for good and for bad.

Gary LeClair may yet prove to have been a prophet or a madman. Quite possibly, he’ll prove to have been both.

# It's A Counter-Cyclical World And Law Firms Are All Just Living In It
## The slow and steady practice groups have kept law firms on track.

The grave recession that pundits warned about never really materialized. Whether that’s a factor of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive belt-tightening or a systematic misread of transitory inflation or a little of both, only the most cynical observers still see economic gloom. Even Larry Kudlow, the wrongest economist of all time, is [admitting that his economic pessimism was all wrong](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2024/02/03/ex-trump-economic-adviser-larry-kudlow-biden-recession-nn-vpx.cnn). Some law firms are [still going to lay people off](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/goodwin-is-cutting-even-more-associate-jobs-under-the-guise-of-performance-reviews/), but it’s becoming near impossible to blame that on the economy.

The Thomson Reuters [Q4 2023 Law Firm Financial Index report](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/lffi-q4-2023-improving-fortunes/) is out and, unsurprisingly, law firms are doing great. Yay.

But that doesn’t mean there aren’t some hangover effects from the little-recession-that-never-did.

The last quarter of 2023 saw law firms experience positive movement across all fronts — from legal demand and billing rates to productivity and expenses. This holistic improvement suggests a robust response to the challenges and opportunities presented by the current economic landscape. Particularly, large law firms continue to benefit from counter-cyclical demand, indicating a resilience that, while not eclipsing the highs of 2021, has managed to steady firms despite stagnant transactional demand.

So even though the economy never fell off a cliff, counter-cyclical practices continue to drive firms across segments:



One would expect the transactional work to pick up as the Fed gets less hawkish about interest rates. But since the economy never really had the ballyhooed collapse, why is counter-cyclical demand enjoying this little boom?

It might be more fair to say that the counter-cyclical units remained steady while everyone else freaked out.



So, for now, embrace the litigators in your lives. They kept this ship afloat last year while everyone else made the mistake of trusting Kudlow.

Recently two of our more-junior attorneys came into my office and began debating one of our pending cases.

The facts of the particular case matter little, but suffice it to say they were engaged in a full-throated debate on case strategy and wanted my input on how they should respond to the plaintiff’s most recent demand letter.

As I sat back and began to reflect on their arguments, it hit me. I had heard the facts of this particular case before, and I was quite certain we had made the decision to retain outside counsel to handle the matter.

To ensure I was not mistaken, I incredulously asked if this was indeed the same case I was thinking of, and if so, why were they debating the issue rather than kicking it to our outside partners.

“It sure is,” one of them responded, “but we have been on enough calls with outside to have kept up with the case, and this is such a straightforward issue, we thought we could respond directly and save us a few dollars in the process.”

While I thanked them for their fiscal stewardship of our company’s dollars, I curtly ended the meeting and instructed them to send the matter to our outside firm.

Although I wish I could say this was an isolated incident during my time in-house, it happens to be quite common. We attorneys are a prideful bunch and may often default to our desire to own an issue rather than to call for outside reinforcements.

I have been guilty, on more than one occasion, of declining to reach out to a retained outside colleague for a myriad of reasons, ranging from fear of the billable hour to the simplicity of the matter. But the longer I have stayed in my in-house role, the more I have come to value an effective outside partner.

To my fellow in-house counsel, it is imperative to remember to keep your own egos in check and those of your colleagues. While, yes, in some matters outside counsel get brought in for their expertise, they also get brought in due to a resource they have more of: time.

Remind your colleagues that an outside presence is not indicative of an in-house failure or lack of competence, but rather a lack of resources. Viewing outside as an extension of your own team will only help benefit your single client in the long run.

And to outside counsel everywhere, I recognize you have a particularly difficult client to deal with: other lawyers.

The best outside partners I have worked with have gone above and beyond to communicate with the in-house team on even the most mundane of details. From a simple email to a check-in for updates, to turning to us for sign-off on relatively routine matters, keeping your in-house client engaged in the process can go a long way towards engendering a sense a goodwill and teamwork.

Rather simple and idealistic advice? Sure. But in the heat of a contentious case, it can often be forgotten.

Besides, even if outside counsel is an expensive resource to have, in the grand scheme of a large lawsuit, what’s a few more billable hours amongst friends?

# How Attorneys And Law Firms Can ‘Raise The Floor’ For Diversity, Equity, And Inclusion In 2017
## It is no secret, like the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, the legal profession is facing a diversity crisis.

“Never taking summer or fall off / when you stay committed to it / you just fall down and never fall off.” — [Big Sean](http://genius.com/10797684)

Last month, Megan Smith and Laura Powers wrote a post for the [WhiteHouse Blog](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/11/28/raising-floor-sharing-what-works-workplace-diversity-equity-and-inclusion), which summarized what they’ve heard and seen work in creating a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable science and technology workforce. They compiled various insights and tips into an [Action Grid](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/11/28/raising-floor-sharing-what-works-workplace-diversity-equity-and-inclusion) designed to be a resource for those striving to create better work atmospheres.

It is no secret, like the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, the [legal profession](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/implicit-bias-the-silent-killer-of-diversity-in-the-legal-profession/) is facing a [diversity crisis](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/ball-dont-lie-what-percentage-of-biglaw-partners-are-white/). It is unlikely that diversity statistics for lawyers in 2020 will look much different than [diversity figures in 2000](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/minorities-in-the-legal-profession-have-increased-by-less-than-one-percent-since-2000/). And although Smith’s and Powers’s grid was created for the science and technology workforce to improve their diversity, it can dually-serve as a roadmap for law firms to create more diverse, inclusive, and equitable legal cultures.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Research has shown that diverse groups are more effective at problem solving than homogeneous groups, and policies that promote diversity and inclusion will enhance our ability to draw from the broadest possible pool of talent, solve our toughest challenges, maximize employee engagement and innovation, and lead by example by setting a high standard for providing access to opportunity to all segments of our society. — President Obama, October 5, 2016

Diversity, equity, and inclusion work is not one size fits all. We hope this set of potential actions clustered by leadership engagement, retention and advancement, hiring, and ecosystem support provides ideas and a jumping off point for conversations within your team or organization on steps that you can take to increase diversity and to make your workforce more reflective of the communities you serve, customers you sell to, and talent pools you draw from. — Megan Smith and Laura Powers, November 28, 2016

Smith and Powers focus on leadership, retention and advancement, hiring pathways, and ecosystem support to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion. Here is an extreme cliff-notes version of their Action Grid:

Leadership: Increase leadership engagement of senior and mid-level management.

For leadership, Smith and Powers recommend:

For hiring pathways, Smith and Powers recommend:

-  Expanding points of entry
-  Updating candidate screening systems
Ecosystem: Build external constituencies of support

For ecosystem support, Smith and Powers recommend:

-  Finding allies in the work
-  Using moments of influence to further the work
If you have a minute, Smith’s and Powers’s post titled, [Raising the Floor: Sharing What Works in Workplace Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/11/28/raising-floor-sharing-what-works-workplace-diversity-equity-and-inclusion), is well worth reading. None of these tips are overly complicated or difficult to implement, but they aren’t necessarily easy either. Change is hard. But we must accept that the last two decades have [yielded little improvement](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/without-significant-changes-diversity-in-the-legal-profession-will-remain-on-life-support/) for diversity figures in the legal profession.

Many people and organizations will make New Year’s resolutions this week, only to give up on them several weeks later. But some people and organizations find a way to commit to their goals and hold themselves and others accountable over the long term. Because they know, as Albert Einstein famously quipped, “insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”

What will you and your law firm do different in 2017 to raise the floor in the legal profession?

# Another Firm Joins The Salary Re-Raise
## I feel bad for the payroll people who just did this two weeks ago.

Back in February, you know, a couple weeks back or so, we were all so young. People wore masks everywhere, Russia hadn’t invaded Ukraine, and law firms were still paying $396.5 for senior associates. But that’s all changed. Cravath has blown the lid off associate compensation, raising the bar for the third time this year and the rest of Biglaw is furiously catching up.

Back in February, Kramer Levin raised associate comp to keep up with the then-prevailing rate, but times have changed and Kramer Levin is determined to change with them, announcing a match up to the $415K top slot (well, technically $420K for the next class up, but many firms have those lawyers already off the grid).



Salaries are retroactive to January 1 and will appear in next week’s check.

Congrats.

# Failing My Way To Success 
## And how I found the cool kids of the legal ecosystem.

“This is the most important initiative at the company right now, and we need you to really focus on this,” they said. It was 2017, and I was a salesman who sold e-discovery technology to small law firms. The company I was working at was a hot venture-backed startup that was looking to move “[upmarket](https://www.proposify.com/blog/saas-moving-upmarket)” and to start selling their tech to some of the largest firms in the world.

On paper it seemed pretty straightforward. Large firms are just like small firms, except they have a lot more money and cases, right? It seemed like I was the right person for the job. I used to work in Biglaw, as a litigation associate, and had firsthand knowledge of what kind of sales pitches would be compelling to large firms.

But deep down inside, I had my doubts. Small litigation firms needed our tech to work more efficiently to keep price points low, as they competed for clients against larger firms. Biglaw, on the other hand, had very little use for our technology. Efficiency would cut down on billable hours, which would reduce overall firm revenue. The incentives just weren’t aligned.

There were other headwinds too. Biglaw firms have a decentralized org structure ([kind of like an archipelago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/law-firms-archipelagos-key-legal-tech-success-john-alber/)) which means it’s incredibly hard to convince them to buy software for the whole firm. This was especially true in the e-discovery space where Biglaw firms typically use lots of different providers, depending on the case or client. Which meant the whole initiative was probably less lucrative than it seemed.

I went to great lengths to try to make it work out, though. I hosted happy hours and dinners, asked people out for coffee, and just cold called virtually everyone at the firm. But they all ignored me. Biglaw just had too many other priorities, and just wasn’t interested in hearing what I had to say.

In the end I had absolutely zero revenue to show for it. Eventually, my company scrapped the initiative and reassigned me to my previous role. I stopped thinking about Biglaw completely.

That is, until about a year later, at a conference out in Chicago.

The Epiphany

For technology vendors, conferences all kind of feel the same. You show up in your booth and try to hand out swag and attempt to persuade attendees to stop by and talk to you, who by the way, want absolutely nothing to do with you.

But at this conference things were different. At least for me. Because early on, someone influential introduced me to a bunch of his friends, all of whom were in-house lawyers at corporate legal departments.

Now as an e-discovery salesman, I’d never really paid too much attention to legal departments. They didn’t typically buy e-discovery tech. But at this conference I didn’t know anyone else. What else was I going to do? So I just hung out with these in-house lawyers. Which turned out to be the best thing because we all got along great and had a fantastic time. We got drinks, stayed out late, and just had a lot of fun.

And that’s when I noticed Biglaw firms starting to treat me differently.

You see, before they saw me hanging out with these in-house lawyers, the firms had zero interest in talking to me. They did the whole “avert your eyes” thing to avoid having to speak with me. But. Once they saw me rubbing elbows with their potential clients, everything changed. They started to approach me for conversations, presumably to get a warm transition or introduction to my new friends.

I felt like the nerd who accidentally became part of the cool crowd.

The change in how I was treated made me think. It dawned upon me that the corporate legal department is central to the legal ecosystem in a very unique way. These assistant GCs and deputy GCs might not earn as much money as their law firm counterparts. But they had sway. They had clout.

And yet, in the legal tech startup world, entrepreneurs often focused their attention on Biglaw firms instead.

Could you blame them? From the outside, Biglaw seems to be the most important customer segment. They do the most interesting and cutting legal work, and are at the top of the economic food chain. They are absurdly profitable (the economic “slowdown” of 2022 has so far resulted in [a mere 3.6% drop in profits](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/08/08/early-warning-arises-as-law-firm-profits-fall-again/)) which seems to imply that they also have the largest technology budgets. Which isn’t always the case.

When it comes to innovation, though, the hierarchy is very different. Corporate clients are far more influential when it comes to driving tech adoption. They love efficiency. The incentives are aligned. And who knows? If you won them over, they might force their outside counsel to adopt your technology, because it could make *the firms* more efficient — which could minimize legal fees.

That was the first moment I wondered if I needed to make a change. Maybe I was doing it all wrong. Maybe I needed to work for a legal tech company that serves corporate legal departments instead of law firms.

The Transition

That insight is what eventually led me to abruptly leave the e-discovery space to join the contracts technology space in 2019. [There were a few different factors](https://www.alexofftherecord.com/p/why-i-left-e-discovery-for-contracts) that played into my decision. It wasn’t easy though. I’d be leaving a lot of money on the table. There was an arms race for talent in the e-discovery space, and not only would I earn less by moving to contracts instead — I’d also be giving up a lot of the skills and connections I’d built up.

Plus, I mean, I had no experience with contracts. I’d done exactly zero transactions while I was in Biglaw. I’d never worked as an in-house lawyer, and knew just about nothing about commercial contracts. There was nothing on my resume, or in my background, that would suggest that I’d be successful in the emerging contracts space.

No matter. Once my eyes were opened, I couldn’t look away. I started to notice other trends. There was, for example, [the explosive growth of legal operations and CLOC](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/for-2019-legal-operations-success-prime-62997/). The existence of an established legal ops community meant that you could efficiently sell technology to lots of different corporate legal departments. Which at the time was unprecedented.

Buyers in this world also preferred to pay for subscriptions, which was aligned with the [“enterprise SaaS” revenue model](https://www.hardingloevner.com/why-subscription-revenue-is-lifting-the-enterprise-software-industry-and-investor-expectations/). And the potential market for contracts tech was huge. Because every single company has contracts.

There was a lot to like in this new world. Even if I felt uncomfortable in it.

Three Years Later 

Looking back, making the switch to the contracts space in 2019 was absolutely the right decision for me. I found a new segment of the legal industry that was far more receptive to new technology. Because it was such a new niche, I was exposed to lots of different opportunities to grow. Which never would’ve happened in an established category like e-discovery, where I’d be [overlooked for promotions](https://www.alexofftherecord.com/p/slow-down-to-speed-up) or have to wait in line behind countless execs with decades of experience.

The best and most unexpected part was that my next job — running sales for a contracts tech startup — helped me stumble into a hyperniche involving legal tech, marketing, and content creation. I was somehow able to figure out how to use social media to capture attention from corporate legal departments at scale. Which ended up being valuable enough to [help me land the perfect role designed specifically for me](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/a-funny-thing-happened-on-my-way-to-a-law-career/) at the leading company in the contracts tech space.

I’m not sure what the most important lesson from all this is. Maybe it’s that legal tech startups should focus on corporate legal departments instead of Biglaw. Or maybe it’s that sometimes the right decision is to walk away from what you’re comfortable with, to something completely unfamiliar. Hell, maybe it’s that [going to conferences is still valuable.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/are-conferences-still-worth-it/)

Whatever it is, I’m glad that I was sent on that mission to sell e-discovery tech to Biglaw years ago. Because even though it didn’t work out, it put me on the path I’m on today. And I’m so thankful for it.

# The Pink Ghetto: Biglaw's Glass Ceiling
## Women in Biglaw find themselves unable to get ahead thanks to partners' patriarchal social mores.

Try to crack Biglaw’s glass ceiling.

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. Today, we’ll be taking a look at the way women are treated in Biglaw firms, who often find themselves unable to get ahead thanks to partners’ patriarchal social mores. These are real emails that we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
When I was at the end of my first year as an associate at a Biglaw firm, a partner who I had done a lot of work for called me into his office and said he wanted to give me a performance review in advance of formal reviews. After praising my work, he said, “There’s just one thing that I would caution you about. You’re very attractive and you should know that it’s distracting to men. If you are in a meeting full of men, they are thinking about your legs under the table. It can be limiting to your career. Juries don’t like attractive women.” And on, and on…. I walked straight from that “meeting” to my partner mentor’s office and repeated everything word for word. Although my mentor offered to support me in formally complaining, it was obvious that doing so was career suicide. I kept it to myself and left the firm a year later.

I worked at Biglaw firm for almost a year and a half before I quit because of management issues, mass associate exodus, underpayment for market rate, and failure to follow through with written promises.

There was always sexism at the firm — only two female partners in litigation — but after I gave my notice, I experienced it every single day until I left. One partner, who I considered a mentor, came into my office to discuss my resignation, and after small talk blatantly asked, “What would your father think of you quitting your job?” Another partner, a driving force behind my decision to quit, stopped by and explained, “I have never had personal or family issues, and you seem to have a lot.” He continued that he just could not relate and it made sense that I was leaving to deal with my “personal issues.” Finally, when I went to hand case files to a different male partner — a partner on the management committee — he first asked, “What does your family think of you just quitting your job?” Then he said, “What will you do to pay rent… oh, wait, you live with your family so I guess you do not have to worry about that.”

I wondered whether any of these questions would be asked of a male associate.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
As a 2L, I was looking for a position as a summer associate. I interviewed at a large firm that has a prestigious reputation in my community. The male interviewer asks me, as one of the first questions, “So, how will your children feel about you working full time?” I was aghast. My first reaction was to ask him, “How do YOUR children feel about YOU working full time?” but held my tongue and told him I had live-in help. I was shocked, as no where on my résumé did it state that I was a mother or had children. I thought it was presumptuous to assume I had kids and that even more presumptuous that it was an appropriate issue or question to be asked on an interview. No surprise, I did not get the summer associateship. It was given to a man.

# Stat Of The Week: Biglaw Bill Rates Creep Up Again

For corporate law departments, “doing more with less” became a pandemic-era cliche, as many faced the combination of increasing legal challenges and reduced organizational revenue. 

While this led to a heightened focus on legal operations in 2020, a new survey shows that it also failed to slow the continued rise of Biglaw billing rates.

According to the Enterprise Legal Management Trends Report from LexisNexis’ CounselLink, partner hourly rates at U.S. law firms grew 3.5% in 2020 — a slightly faster rate than the 3.3% increase from 2018-19.

The report also showed the 50 largest firms again taking a “commanding share” of this work, with 49% of outside counsel spending going to this group.

The report wasn’t all bad news for budget-conscious GCs, however. 

The use of alternative fee arrangements also continued its steady growth for corporate counsel, with 16.8% of matters having a billing arrangement not entirely composed of hourly billing. 

As the report notes: “The percentage of alternative fee arrangements (AFAs) has been gradually rising over the years. It is noteworthy that in 2020, AFAs were utilized for more than 10% of matters in each major practice area except Commercial, which billed 9.9% of matters under an AFA in 2020.”

# Biglaw Firm Changes Course On Associate Compensation
## It's a firm's prerogative to change its mind.

Just last week, associates outside of Covington & Burling’s New York office were singing the blues, pretty sure they weren’t getting a raise anytime soon. And it wasn’t just paranoia in the D.C. office; they got [an email from firm leadership](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-salary-hike-not-all-offices-are-created-equal/) pretty much telling them it wasn’t happening:

At this point, our view is that this increase in New York salaries does not reflect the prevailing market in Washington or other cities outside New York. Traditionally, associate salaries in New York have been somewhat higher than in other markets around the country.

But all that has changed (though [some argue not for the better](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/)). Apparently spurred by the onslaught of D.C. and California firms that are raising salaries — in addition, of course, to the New York market — Covington has just announced that all U.S. associates will be seeing a bigger paycheck effective July 1.

So summer associates are also getting a pay raise, while international associates will just have to keep waiting. Hopefully, for their sake, the international markets will follow suit.

Now that Covington, the only Biglaw firm to publicly suggest limiting market raises to New York, has made this change for all U.S. offices, it’s pretty clear the trend is #Everyoneto180K.

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

# Clients Better Get Ready For Some Supersized Biglaw Rate Increases In 2023

We’re seeing higher planned rate increases at this point than we’ve ever seen, and we’ve been tracking this for 15 years.

— Owen Burman, senior consultant for Wells Fargo Legal Specialty Group, commenting on the [“aggressive” billing rate increases](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/22/raising-billing-rates-in-2023-becomes-a-singular-focus-for-law-firms-405-113467/) Biglaw firms are planning for 2023. Law firm leaders said rates will be raised by about 7% or 8% on average. “[I]nflation is definitely a consideration in being aggressive on the rate increases, and trying to make up for two years in which the rate increases did not cover inflation,” Burman said.

# Biglaw Giant Continues To Clean House After Bullying Allegations
## More fallout.

It wasn’t that long ago that we told you about the Baker McKenzie partner who, ahem, [moved on from the mega Biglaw firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/baker-mckenzie-partner-out-after-bullying-allegations/) following bullying allegations. The allegations against Morne van der Merwe, the onetime managing partner of the firm’s Johannesburg office, included current and former employees saying he “bullied,” “demeaned,” and “degraded” them. And it looks like there’s even more fallout from the scandal.

As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-baker-mckenzie-clears-out-more-south-africa-management-after-bullying) Jamie Hamilton at Roll on Friday, two other members of the Baker McKenzie leadership team are out. Wildu du Plessis, the now-former head of Baker McKenzie’s Global Africa Practice, and Bruce Schubach, the soon-to-be-former Director of Africa Operations, are on their way out the door. Du Plessis, Schubach, and van der Merwe were reportedly known as “the three musketeers” in the Johannesburg office, fueling speculation about their exit from the firm.

But Baker McKenzie is keeping its public statement to the mere fact of their departures, with an noticeable absence of thanks for their efforts:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Asked this week whether the other two had embraced the spirit of ‘all for one, one for all’ and followed van der Merwe, a spokesperson told RollOnFriday, “Wildu du Plessis has stepped down as a Principal of Baker McKenzie and, with effect from 10 September 2021, as a director and shareholder of Baker McKenzie Inc in Johannesburg. He will leave the Firm on 30 September 2021″.

He confirmed that Schubach would be leaving on 24 September.

None of three was publicly thanked for their service, in what represents an extraordinary clear out of the management of Baker McKenzie’s South Africa operation.

Hopefully the firm can now put this unfortunate chapter behind them.

# Sidley Creates New Titles For Associates As Part Of Program To Develop Leadership
## Being a good senior associate takes more than just years on the job.

With the battle for associate talent at a [fever pitch](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/), Biglaw firms are trying to distinguish themselves in any way they can. Enter Sidley. The firm has announced a new associate leadership and executive development program that will launch in the new year and is designed to create “world-class, business-savvy lawyers.”

The program is available to associates in their fourth through eighth years at the firm, and will feature MBA-level executive training. As folks advance at the firm, they’ll earn promotions with enhanced titles — Managing Associate or Senior Managing Associate — which, in addition to making your mom proud, will signal to clients and the rest of the world the new skills you’ve learned.

So, what does all that entail? As Yvette Ostolaza, chair-elect of Sidley’s Management Committee and global co-leader of Sidley’s Litigation group, told me, associates will have access to executive leadership programs at business schools such as Harvard, Columbia, Stanford, The University of Chicago, and Northwestern. Which is in addition to internal executive leadership academies focused on business, client, and professional skills. As they move through the program, they’ll also be afforded the opportunity to work on “hands-on passion projects” with with select nonprofit legal and community organizations, and this is more than just legal pro bono opportunities — there’s a wide range of community service that falls under this umbrella. More senior associates will also get personalized career and business development coaching.

If this sounds a lot like programs in the corporate world, you’re right — that’s what Ostolaza and Sidley modeled the program after. Instead of just throwing associates into management positions without training or experience, Sidley is giving folks the tools to excel at their evolving roles at the firm. But they also hope the program — which is voluntary and all the time associates spend on it will count towards bonus hours — will create a “stickiness” within the cohort that participates together.

As Ostolaza said of the program:

“We want our associates to have the opportunity to advance their careers and credentials through world-class executive training. In addition to our competitive compensation, we will continue to invest in our associates and clients by providing, and paying for, MBA-level executive training at top universities. At the same time, we recognize that our clients value lawyers who understand big-picture business issues and how those impact their legal matters. We see an opportunity to prepare our associates to rise to the challenges our clients face in an increasingly complex and dynamic global market. The career coaching is an added way to have our associates chart their own path whether they choose to stay with us for the rest of their careers, or become a leader at a client or in their communities.”

Michael Schmidtberger, chair of the firm’s Executive Committee, had this to say of the new program:

“The Sidley program is a key part of our comprehensive approach to associate development and well-being. We are committed to providing our associates with the resources and training necessary to help them become the best possible version of their professional selves over the long term – this program directly responds to their desire for development and leadership opportunities.”

Looks like Sidley knows that investing in associates takes more than handfuls of bonus cash.  Of course, everyone loves that, but the skills and training available as part of this program will last longer than the time it takes to pay off your student loans. Ostolaza shared this is a significant financial investment on the part of the firm, but they want associates — no matter where their career takes them — to feel the lasting impact of the program. And Ostolaza speaks from experience, she recently took Disruptive Innovation at Harvard — similar to the MBA-level classes available as part of the program — and found her way of thinking changed by the class.

And maybe, just maybe, it will give associates a reason to stay at the firm.

# AI Certification For Lawyers: Navigating The Knowledge Conundrum
## In the debate on whether lawyers need AI certification, the answer may well be personal and contextual.

In an age where acquiring certificates has become as commonplace as scrolling through social media, a pertinent question arises for legal professionals: Is an AI certification essential for lawyers? 

The debate surrounding education versus practical application in the legal profession is not new. However, the rapid advancement of technology, especially in AI, cybersecurity, and privacy, brings a renewed focus to this discussion. 

The Case For AI Certification

The proponents of AI certification argue that the legal profession cannot remain insulated from technological advancements. With AI increasingly becoming a part of daily life, its implications for privacy, security, intellectual property, and even for criminal law are profound. 

An AI certification for lawyers could serve as a testament to their understanding of these complex intersections between technology and law. It could help legal professionals advise clients more effectively, navigate through AI-related legal challenges, and even leverage AI tools for litigation and contract analysis. 

Moreover, specialized certifications can set a lawyer apart in a competitive market. They signal to potential employers or clients that the lawyer possesses up-to-date knowledge and a proactive approach to learning and adapting. In sectors like tech startups, fintech, and cybersecurity, where AI plays a critical role, having legal advisors who understand the technology could be invaluable.

The Critique: Is More Learning Less Doing?

Critics, however, argue that the obsession with certifications might lead to a paradox where more learning equates to less doing. Drawing from the insights shared in the discourse on the drawbacks of excessive certification, there’s a growing concern that the pursuit of endless qualifications could become a loop. This loop ensnares professionals in a perpetual state of preparation, delaying their direct engagement with the real-world challenges and opportunities that define their careers.

The critique is not against learning per se but against a linear and traditional approach to education that prioritizes credentials over practical experience and application. The argument is that in the fast-evolving field of AI, hands-on experience, adaptability, and the ability to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios are far more valuable than a certificate. After all, AI itself is about innovation, experimentation, and learning by doing. 

There’s also a financial and temporal aspect to consider. Certifications can be expensive and time-consuming, potentially diverting resources from more productive investments like building a portfolio, networking, or even starting a tech-driven legal initiative. 

Bridging The Gap: Strategic Learning and Application

Perhaps the resolution doesn’t lie at the extremes but in a balanced approach. Lawyers don’t necessarily need an AI certification to excel in their profession, but they do need a foundational understanding of how technology affects the law. Strategic learning — where education is closely aligned with career goals and is immediately applied in practice — could be the way forward. 

This approach entails being selective about learning opportunities, focusing on those that offer practical skills and insights directly applicable to work. It also means applying what’s learned in real-world settings as soon as possible, whether through pro bono projects, tech-based legal solutions, or innovative service offerings. Such an approach ensures that learning leads to tangible outcomes, keeping professionals relevant and ahead of the curve.

So, The Middle Path, Maybe?

In the debate on whether lawyers need AI certification, the answer may well be personal and contextual. The classic “it depends” may be the answer. For example, it may depend on the individual’s career path, area of specialization, and how they intend to apply their knowledge of AI in their legal practice. While certifications can play a role in professional development, they are not the be-all and end-all.  

As the legal community navigates the complexities of a technology-driven world, the focus should be on continuous, strategic learning and the practical application of knowledge. In doing so, legal professionals can ensure they remain effective, relevant, and prepared to tackle the challenges and opportunities that AI presents in the legal domain.

# Now The DLA Piper Accuser Has Been Put On Leave
## Her lawyer says it is part of a 'smear campaign.'

Vanina Guerrero

Damn, this case just keeps on getting messier and messier.

Biglaw followers have likely been keeping up to date on the details of this case, but, for the sake of completeness, we’ll hit the highlights. Earlier this month, DLA Piper partner Vanina Guerrero released an open letter to the firm, and filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, [alleging that the co-managing partner of the Silicon Valley office, Louis Lehot repeatedly sexually assaulted her](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-fellow-partner/) after she’d been recruited to the firm in 2018. She additionally asked the firm to release her from their mandatory arbitration agreement so she’d be able to pursue her claims in open court. The firm has been conspicuously silent on the forced arbitration agreement — despite the [attention their arbitration stance](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/kamala-harris-gets-dragged-into-dla-piper-sexual-assault-controversy/) in this case [has garnered](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/law-school-students-protest-outside-of-dla-piper-over-alleged-sexual-assault/), but, they did announce that Lehot had been [let go from the firm.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-out-amid-sexual-assault-allegations/)

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
In the latest twist, the firm placed Guerrero herself on administrative leave. According to the firm’s statement on the matter, new claims about Guerrero’s behavior were uncovered during the course of their investigation into Lehot, as [reported by](https://biglawbusiness.com/dla-piper-places-on-leave-the-partner-who-said-she-was-assaulted) Big Law Business:

“During the course of our investigation into her claims, serious issues were brought to the firm’s attention,” DLA Piper said Wednesday. Its statement didn’t say what those alleged issues are, except that they involved Guerrero’s “conduct towards and involving others at the firm,” are unrelated to her claims about Lehot, and “require a separate investigation.”

And Guerrero’s lawyer, Jeanne Christensen of Wigdor LLP, is PISSED. According to a statement from the lawyer, Guerrero was not informed of the specific allegations against her before she was placed on leave. Additionally, Christensen takes the position that the firm is engaged in a smear campaign against her client:

This is a despicable smear campaign against a female victim of sexual assault. Female lawyers, associates or partners, and female employees at DLA Piper and law firms everywhere should be frightened and deeply concerned.

The message is loud and clear: #MeToo movement or not – speaking out about gender motivated violence will result in untold harm, damage and pain to you personally and professionally.

How can lawyers at DLA Piper stand by and watch this happen to one of their own?

How can clients of DLA Piper stand by and say this is ok?

The [firm is declining](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/10/16/dla-piper-removes-female-partner-who-alleged-sex-assault-triggering-smear-campaign-accusation/) to release additional information about the allegation against Guerrero:

“Given the nature of these serious claims, as well as Ms. [Vanina Guerrero] de Verneuil’s refusal to cooperate regarding the allegations against her, the firm has determined that the best course of action at this time is to place Ms. [Vanina Guerrero] de Verneuil on paid administrative leave. We are not in a position to comment further now other than to provide this brief statement in order to ensure that the public record is accurate in light of extensive public commentary from Ms. [Vanina Guerrero] de Verneuil and her lawyers.”

We’ll be following these developments as they happen.

# Tom Cotton Threatens Top Biglaw Firms Over Their Diversity & Inclusion Initiatives
## He's going after the biggest firms in the country to put an end to their DEI efforts.

In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn affirmative action within higher education, conservative legislators want to take it a step further and limit diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace, too. After all, they find initiatives far too “progressive,” and they need to be done away with.

Senator [Tom Cotton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cotton) (R-AR), a Harvard Law School graduate, has chosen to launch an assault against some of the largest law firms in the country, warning them that their DEI programming — and their advice to clients regarding such programming — may violate federal law. Earlier this week, Cotton sent these threat letters to more than 50 firms, many of them among the Am Law 100’s most elite.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Biglaw firms ranging from Akin Gump, Baker McKenzie, and Cleary Gottlieb to Simpson Thacher, Sullivan & Crowell, and Weil Gotshal received the exact same letters (available on the next page), each containing the following language:

Federal law has long prohibited treating employees differently because of their race. Employers should take to heart the Supreme Court’s recent declaration that “eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it.” Congress will increasingly use its oversight powers—and private individuals and organizations will increasingly use the courts—to scrutinize the proliferationn of race-based employment practices. To the extent that your firm continues to advise clients regarding DEI programs or operate one of your own, both you and those clients should take care to preserve relevant documents in anticipation of investigations and litigation.

One of Cotton’s aides reached by [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/sen-cotton-warns-big-law-its-dei-efforts-could-lead-to-lawsuits) had this to say about the letters: “Following the ruling against affirmative action, investigations into race-based DEI programs are inevitable. Senator Cotton sent the letter so that the firms which keep race-based programs will be prepared to answer to Congress.”

This is not the first time conservative legislators have sent vaguely threatening letters to Biglaw firms in the wake of a Supreme Court decision. Recall that in the wake of the Dobbs decision, Texas legislators [threatened Sidley](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/texas-legislators-threaten-sidley-over-abortion-care-travel-costs/) for reimbursing travel costs related to abortion care.

# Preparing A Witness For Cross-Examination At Trial
## I finally gave in: I conceded in my own mind that I'll never go back to litigating cases.

I litigated for twenty-five years, but then I swapped litigating for my in-house role, which involves supervising litigation. I’ve now been supervising for ten years, which means 1., I’m old, and 2., I’m out of practice, so I’ll never return to life at a firm.

I went through my old files, and I ran across my old crib sheet containing some of the general rules for preparing witnesses for cross-examination at trial. I didn’t include this stuff in my book ([The Curmudgeon’s Guide to Practicing Law](https://www.amazon.com/Curmudgeons-Guide-Practicing-Law-Second/dp/1641054344)), so I figured I’d share those notes here, before I tossed them.

What do you tell all witnesses before they’ll be cross-examined at trial?

First: Do not change your demeanor on cross.

This is a big one, and witnesses routinely violate it. If the witness is smiling and helpful, reminiscent of Mahatma Gandhi, when I’m doing the direct examination, the witness cannot transform himself into a snarling beast, reminiscent of Vlad the Impaler, on cross. The jury will notice this, and the jury will hold it against the witness.

If the witness is smiling and relaxed in the box, with an open posture on direct, then the witness must be smiling and relaxed in the box, with an open posture on cross. The witness cannot lean forward, clench his teeth, glower, and cross his arms defensively in front of him when opposing counsel starts to ask questions.

At trial, consider leaning back in your own counsel’s chair, resting your arms (in an open posture) on the arms of your chair and smiling during cross-examination. That way, when the witness glances at you (as all witnesses do) during cross, the witness will realize that he’s changed his demeanor on cross and will, at least briefly, correct the error.

Be the same helpful person on cross as you are on direct.  After all, the jury’s watching.

Second: Answer in full sentences.

Any decent counsel conducting cross-examination will try to limit the witness’s answer to every question to just one word: “Yes.” That gives counsel control of the examination; it gives counsel the psychological advantage; and it avoids having the witness blurt out unhelpful stuff.

Thus: Tell your witness not to answer monosyllabically. Answer in full sentences instead. It’s not hard.

Cross, trying to elicit a one-syllable answer: “Your name is Mark Herrmann, correct?”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Bad witness: “Yes.”

Good witness: “My name is Mark Herrmann.” (Perhaps nodding, showing that the witness is trying to be helpful.)

Cross: “You’re wearing a white shirt; is that true?”

Bad witness: “Yes.”

Good witness: “I do have on a white shirt.”

This routine habituates the witness into answering in full sentences. It avoids falling into the trap of answering “yes” to every question. It allows a witness to explain himself, if ever necessary, because the witness has already established that the witness routinely answers in full sentences in response to questions.  And it permits the witness to correct bad questions:

Cross: “You’re wearing a white shirt and you’re a criminal, correct?”

Good witness: “I do have on a white shirt.”

Answer in full sentences.

Third: Own your answers.

Don’t be sheepish. Everyone will be impeached on cross. It happens.

So don’t look guilty when it happens. Look pleased and happy, like you’re winning. (The jury may not know who’s winning. If the witness looks happy, the jury may assume that the witness is ahead.)

Part of that game is owning your answers: Not, sheepishly, “No,” or “I guess not,” or “Maybe I was wrong.” Instead, confidently, “Of course not,” as though only a fool would think otherwise. Say it proudly: “Of course I shot my dog.”

Don’t look as though you’re being savaged on cross.

Fourth: Look where the jury is looking.

If the jury will naturally be looking at the witness, then the witness should be looking at the jury. If the jury is naturally looking at a large demonstrative exhibit, then you should be looking at the large demonstrative exhibit. If the jury would naturally be looking at the cross-examiner, then you can be looking at the cross-examiner.

That’s the way people act, and it’s right at trial. Do it.

Fifth: Use the headline theory of testifying.

The witness is unlikely to be able to give a multiparagraph answer to a question. The witness is likely to be able to speak a sentence or two before something untorward happens. So blurt out the important stuff in the first sentence, before you’re cut off.

You’re not writing a novel, element by element, on cross-examination, leading to the final denouement. Instead, you’re writing a newspaper article: Ninety percent of your readers won’t get past the opening paragraph. So don’t bury the lede. Put the important part of the answer in the first sentence.

Those are my five major rules.

There are, of course, a ton of other things that you might like to discuss with a witness before putting the witness on the stand.

Some of it is stylistic: Don’t talk too fast; that looks evasive. Don’t touch your face.

Some of it is just courtroom sense: Always smile after the judge rules on an objection. (The jury may not know who won or lost. But they’ll know that you smiled. That makes you the winner.) You’re on trial within a block of the courthouse. (Don’t park your $65,000 Mercedes near the courthouse. The guy parking the beat-up jalopy next to you will end up on the jury. Don’t criticize the judge in the elevator. The unknown person behind you in the elevator will turn out to be the judge’s clerk. In the bathroom, those stalls were not actually empty.)

But those rules will come with time.

For starters, you might just discuss with your witnesses the five general rules of cross-examination.

I used to think that I was the most money-hungry person out there, but working at Kirkland has made me realize that, as much as I love money, there are A LOT of people that apparently love it more than I do.

— a midlevel associate at Kirkland & Ellis, in response to a question found in the [American Lawyer Midlevel Associates Survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/08/03/the-2022-midlevel-associates-survey-quotable-associates/) about what most surprised them about working at their current firm.

# Biglaw Firm Gives Out Year-End Bonuses, Remains Conspicuously Silent On Any Special Bonuses
## Tipsters say it negatively impacts recruiting.

Folks at Arnold & Porter were already miffed about the firm’s harsh stance on hours this year — the[ 2,000-hour threshold remained in place](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/biglaw-firm-takes-harsh-stance-on-productivity-this-year/?rf=1) despite 2020 being, you know, 2020. Now the firm’s year-end bonus announcement has come, and for the majority of associates, it looks like they won’t be getting full market (year-end and special) bonuses this year, even if they hit that 2k threshold.

In an email that went around yesterday, co-managing partner Michael Daneker revealed the bonus grid at the firm:

No, nothing’s been cut off from this bonus grid. Despite peer firms putting quite a few more more class years on the grid, at A&P they all get lumped into “senior associates.”

According to the email from the firm (available in full on the next page), senior associates will have individualized bonuses that take the prevailing market rate into account. They also indicate they intend to award senior associate bonuses “up to” $140,000, which would account for both the year-end and special bonuses on the Cravath scale. But as is always true of firms with individualized bonuses, there’s no way to track how what percentage of senior associate are actually making market bonuses.

So, it looks like senior associates *might* get market bonuses, but what about midlevel or junior associates? The grid above doesn’t mention any special bonuses for them. Though the email did mention productivity bonuses for those that were super busy (2,400 hours busy) which will be up to 20 percent of their base bonus.

Tipsters at the firm has some pretty harsh words about the system, with one of them saying:

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

Back in September, I heard an intriguing Supreme Court rumor: Justice Anthony M. Kennedy will announce his retirement from the Court next year. The rumor was based on the following:

1. Justice Kennedy is holding his next law clerk reunion in 2017, his 29th year on the Court — instead of 2018, his 30th year on the Court, and more in line with the traditional scheduling of his clerk reunions every five years from his investiture. (See the [letter to the AMK law clerks](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/anatomy-of-a-rumor-on-justice-kennedys-retirement-next-year/2/) posted on the next page.)

2. In another departure from tradition, Justice Kennedy [did not teach abroad](http://electionlawblog.org/?p=85997) this past summer at McGeorge Law’s [Summer Program in Salzburg](http://www.mcgeorge.edu/Students/Academics/International_Study/Summer_Abroad_Programs/Summer_Program_in_Salzburg.htm), suggesting that perhaps he might be slowing down in terms of his schedule.

3. After [hiring one law clerk](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-watch-a-look-at-october-term-2017/) for October Term 2017 — Nick Harper (Chicago 2015 / Kavanaugh), originally hired by the late Justice Antonin Scalia — Justice Kennedy stopped his OT 2017 clerk hiring process.

These pieces of information led some Court observers to think, not unreasonably, that Justice Kennedy might announce his retirement from the Court in June 2017, at or around the time of his law clerk reunion — which would also fall conveniently near the end of the Term, a traditional time for retirement announcements. Judges who are close to their clerks often make such announcements at their clerk reunions. (My own former boss, Judge Diarmuid O’Scannlain of the Ninth Circuit, announced his upcoming [move to senior status](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/a-leading-light-of-the-federal-judiciary-will-take-senior-status-by-years-end/) at his law clerk reunion.)

After hearing this rumor a few weeks ago, I followed up with my sources. I determined that there wasn’t sufficient substance to merit a story, and I decided not to write about it. This is a not uncommon occurrence here at Above the Law; we hear all sorts of wild rumors that fall apart upon investigation.

Fast forward to this week. In the wake of the election of Donald Trump — a Republican president, i.e., a president that the Reagan-appointed Justice Kennedy might be willing to have name his successor — the rumor resurfaced. This time it went public, on Twitter (the “Whelan” referred to by Alan Gura is Ed Whelan, a former Scalia clerk and [longtime commentator](http://www.nationalreview.com/author/ed-whelan) on the Court):



Whelan didn’t name names, but another former Scalia clerk, [Ian Samuel](http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/11599/Samuel/), went there:



I wasn’t planning to write about this rumor — but now that it’s out there, it might as well be addressed with facts.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I reached out to the Supreme Court’s Public Information Office, providing the basis for the speculation about Justice Kennedy. Spokesperson Kathy Arberg provided the following statement:

Justice Kennedy is in the process of hiring clerks for 2017. The Justice didn’t go to Salzburg this past summer because it conflicted with some plans with his family, but he is scheduled to return to teach there in 2017. The reunion is scheduled for the end of this Term because the Justice’s law clerks wanted to hold it during the Justice’s 80th year to mark his birthday.

This statement, which presumably reflects input from Justice Kennedy, strikes me as a persuasive and well-founded rebuttal to the rumors. If AMK were planning to retire next year, the easiest thing would have been for the Court to offer a simple “no comment.”

Now, a few caveats. Is it possible that Justice Kennedy actually is planning to retire next year, but doesn’t want the world to know just yet? Sure. Is it possible that he isn’t currently planning to retire next year, but then changes his mind later? Certainly. Is it possible that he or any of his other colleagues — including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83, and Justice Stephen G. Breyer, 78 — might leave the Court involuntarily? Yes — although we hope not, and wish all of the justices long and happy tenures on the Court.

But based on this statement and the facts it references, it seems to me that people confidently predicting a Kennedy retirement by the end of October Term 2016 are getting a bit ahead of themselves. President-elect Donald Trump will already get one SCOTUS appointment (Justice Scalia’s successor); there’s no need to rush to give him another.

This isn’t the first time that we at Above the Law have heard — and squelched — rumors of a retirement from SCOTUS. Longtime readers might recall how we dispelled the [rumors of a resignation by Chief Justice John Roberts](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/03/anatomy-of-a-rumor-the-story-behind-chief-justice-john-robertss-retirement/) back in 2010.

UPDATE (6/25/2017, 6:08 p.m.): Whoa! At the end of the Term, the AMK retirement rumors [came back with a vengeance](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/no-justice-anthony-m-kennedy-is-not-retiring-tomorrow/) (but turned out, once again, to be unfounded).

# Biglaw Firm Accused Of Firing Recent Widow Because She Seemed Distracted

This isn’t a good look. Biglaw isn’t known for [being the kindest place to work](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/partner-shows-all-the-compassion-youd-expect-from-biglaw-read-none-at-all/), but you’d think — or at least hope — that a raging global pandemic would inspire some compassion. But according to a viral tweet that is not the case.

On Friday public radio producer and writer Starlee Kine tweeted out that her sister was fired from her job as a Biglaw paralegal. Her sister was widowed during lockdown, and the tweet says that the reason she was fired was because her unnamed boss “said she seemed distracted.”

My sister just lost her job because her boss said she seemed distracted. Single widowed (during pandemic) mother with two kids under four, working a nine to five job every day. This system sucks

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Digging through the replies to the tweet, we learn that the widow was employed at Am Law 200 firm Carlton Fields — the firm made $198,752,000 in 2019 gross revenue making it 151st on the [ranking](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=55&name=Carlton-Fields). But despite that solid financial performance, this recent widow says she was fired.

And to add insult to injury, the now-former-Carlton-Fields-employee has to find health insurance during a pandemic. And as a [Go Fund Me](https://www.gofundme.com/f/lacee-lacesa-relief-fund) that’s been set up to defray costs reveals, the widow’s two year old (yeah, she’s a mom to two young kids) was recently diagnosed on the spectrum, so that’s another thing she’s dealing with. It seems rather than react with compassion given all that’s going on in this woman’s life, she was unceremoniously let go from the firm.

We reached out to Carlton Fields for comment, but have yet to hear back.

Best of luck to this recent widow — and [everyone else](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) who suddenly find themselves unemployed right now.

# Biglaw Office Plays Host To Trump Inauguration Party
## This Biglaw firm doesn't think there's a stigma to being associated with President-elect Trump.

Apparently this Biglaw firm doesn’t think there’s a stigma to being associated with President-elect Trump. There’s a party planned in the K&L Gates D.C. office to celebrate the inauguration of the Antichrist our reality TV star in chief, Donald Trump.

The fête features a bizarre mélange of bold names that you’re pretty sure you’ve heard of before but just can’t place. A handful of aging sports stars, a few legal personalities and, of course, [Omarosa](http://www.omarosa.com/) will be there. The party is being thrown by NFL Hall of Famer [Jim Brown’s charitable organization](http://www.amer-i-can.org/), and the names you should recognize include [Ray Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Lewis), [Bobby Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Knight), [Eddie DeBartolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_J._DeBartolo_Jr.), Trump’s attorney [Michael Cohen](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/trumps-attorney-says-stupid-sht-about-rape/), and [Kimberly Guilfoyle](http://kimberlyguilfoyle.com/) (very heavy on members of the [National Diversity Coalition for Trump](http://ndctrump.com/who-we-are/)). And there’ll be fireworks.


Any time a firm takes a public stance on controversial issues, you have to wonder about the potential fallout to recruiting. We know that lawyers generally [tilt towards the left](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/the-mostly-liberal-political-ideologies-of-american-lawyers-law-schools-and-firms/), and [outspoken conservative partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/biglaw-partners-social-media-fail/?rf=1) have, at times, been met with concern in the past. Given the volatile political climate — hipster fav New Balance dealt with[ calls to boycott](https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/people-are-pissed-because-they-think-new-balance-supports-do) the Massachusetts made brand for agreeing with Trump’s stance on trade — there may well be recruiting backlash. If you’re a highly sought-after law student with moderate to liberal political sensibilities, do you really want to go to a Trump firm?

It remains to be seen if, given the changing political landscape, law students will care about a firm’s politics. But it still seems like a bold move for a mediocre mid-afternoon party.

# Biglaw Is Turning Associates Into George Costanzas
## Biglaw fetishizes overwork, and it’s destroying us.

If you ask a Biglaw lawyer how work is going, you can basically guarantee they’ll respond with a variation on “I’m so slammed right now. I’m underwater. I can’t believe how busy it’s been lately.” Lawyers can’t talk about their work without making a point of how overloaded they are. It’s coded into our professional DNA.

In Biglaw, overwork means success. If you’re working at the office while your colleagues are at home with their kids, that means you’re bringing in cash, you’re pushing cases to resolution, you’re helping grow your practice. Plenty of firms operate on the unspoken rule that associates who aren’t working themselves to death aren’t angling for partnership. We share stories of overnight projects and weekend-long crunches like battered warriors showing off their scars. Talking about how exhausted and overworked we are is how attorneys bond, how we signal our worth, and how we try to shape others’ perceptions of us as valuable, in-demand attorneys.

And it’s also killing us.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Work Hard, Play Hard (So Long As You Get Right Back To Work)

Biglaw’s work-to-death mindset is destroying our profession’s ability to grow and change to adapt to the next generation of attorneys on their way up the ranks. The much-maligned Millennials are already reportedly suffering from [high levels of imposter syndrome](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/08/02/imposter-syndrome-in-big-law-millennials-a-survival-guide/). Millennials, on the whole, are wired to want to contribute to their teams in meaningful ways from a much earlier stage in their career than the Boomers and Gen Xers expected. The Biglaw environment is ill-designed to facilitate this. Biglaw is designed to train up attorneys on low-risk, high-hour projects that are hard to fail at, but also hard to see as important or impactful. New associates may find themselves working on doc review or basic legal research their first few years, feeling like all the drive and initiative they demonstrated to get their job is going to waste.

That feeling creeps into one’s psyche over time, to the point where some young associates start to wonder if the reason they aren’t being given chances is that they don’t deserve it. Associates that don’t get early chances at substantive work start to worry they’re too far gone, and won’t be able to ask for help when that opportunity finally arrives without looking foolish and underqualified.

Succeeding All The Way To Failure

Too many in Biglaw are following in the footsteps of George Costanza. In a [classic Seinfeld episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOQmxNPTJwc), when George found himself in a lull at work, he perfected [the art of seeming busy, annoyed, and stressed out](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/dont-be-a-constanza/) at all times to prevent his colleagues from knowing how busy — or not — he actually was. This is not unlike many in Biglaw, where lawyers talk endlessly about how hard they work and how much responsibility is being heaped on them at all hours of the day. Hearing this, what’s a new associate who already feels like an imposter waiting to be found out supposed to do? For too many, the answer is to start trawling the job boards in search of a way to escape the toxicity.

As long as Biglaw continues to incentivize and fetishize overwork, it’s doing itself and its attorneys a disservice. Don’t get me wrong, I believe a strong work ethic is important. But we need to take a longer view of our profession, and a more humane view of one another. An associate grinding day in and day out makes their firm a lot of money, yes, but for how long? Does that associate burn out and head for greener pastures? Or does that associate let their personal life atrophy, tamp down their expectations of personal happiness and fulfillment, and commit to a work-first lifestyle that contributes to our profession’s high incidences of [depression and substance abuse](https://www.gerryriskin.com/five-essential-articles/)? These are both sad outcomes.

A Different Duty of Candor

Simon Sinek, a speaker I’ve referenced in this column [before](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/why-are-you-a-lawyer-and-why-are-you-here/), has a TED talk called [Why Good Leaders Make You Feel Safe](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_why_good_leaders_make_you_feel_safe#t-695678). In a nutshell, Sinek notes making people feel safe in their jobs, trusted, and respected, is one of the primary keys to developing a team that excels. I ask you, is there any class of professional on earth who feels less safe in their job, less trusted, and less respected than Biglaw junior associates? And if that’s the case, why are we allowing it to continue?

Change starts at the top, and it starts with moving past the outdated concept that we all need to be in a constant state of stress, panic, and exhaustion — or that we need to project that we are even if we are not. Being a lawyer is hard. We shoulder tremendous responsibility, to ourselves, our firms, and our clients. We can and will expect to go through periods of overwork, be it trial prepping, crunching through a gigantic deal, or just getting lucky and having lots of clients ready to throw money at us all at once. But we shouldn’t use overwork as our sole criterion for success, nor should we equate evidence of healthy work-life balance with professional failure.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Let’s build workplaces where our young associates feel safe coming out and admitting that they’ve been getting good quality time in with their friends and loved ones. Let’s create environments where associates trying to figure out their careers can come to us and voice their concerns honestly. We all remember from the MPRE that lawyers owe a duty of candor to the court; why would we owe our colleagues, partners, and mentors any less? Let’s encourage attorneys who are heading toward burnout to be honest about it, and treat them moving to a more sustainable workload as a success in personnel management rather than a failure in revenue generation.

Firm culture isn’t something law firms have — it’s what law firms do, day in and day out. When we reward unsustainable, broken behavior, and cultivate expectations that healthy humans can’t meet, we create firms that few of us would actually want to be a part of. We owe it to ourselves, and to those of us that will come after, to do better.

# Associates Laid Off From Cooley May Have Trouble In Job Market, But They Should Hold Out Hope

A lot of employers aren’t going to hold it against them because law firms overhired in 2021 and now there’s no work. Employers are pretty forgiving about that because it’s out of the control of the candidate.

— Julie Brush, Bay Area-based founder and CEO of Solutus Legal Search, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/09/laid-off-lawyers-face-hard-hit-job-market-but-opportunities-remain/), offering a bit of hope for the associates who were recently laid off from Cooley. She said though they may feel “demoralized,” hiring firms won’t necessarily hold it against them because they had no control over the situation.

# Firm Announces They Will Announce Raises... On Thursday

You’re a law firm, not Taylor Swift. You don’t need to pre-announce that you’ll be making announcements.

Maybe that’s too harsh. Perhaps the firm, Venable, just wanted to dispel any speculation that it couldn’t get its act together as soon as possible, but didn’t want to make an official announcement until it could line up a firm-sponsored cocktail party to honor the associates for their accomplishments.

Or maybe they just hope the media sates its appetite for raise stories today before unveiling less-than-attractive senior raises on Thursday.

Here’s what we’ve heard so far:

* The firm will raise the first-year salary to $180K — that’s good.
* The firm will raise salaries for second-years and above — that’s… good, but by how much?
* All salary adjustments will take effect on January 1, 2017 — [RECORD SCRATCH]

Wha? January?!? We’ve trolled the firms who tried to push the effective date of these raises off until September, but January is ridiculous.

Remember that [our last “angry associates” round up](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/angry-associates-ask-wheres-my-money/) raised the spectre of a firm hoping to gather the good press of a $180K match while compressing associate salaries up the line:

Mid level and senior associates at Venable are definitely concerned about a Reed Smith type situation happening here. We only raised to market for juniors a few years ago, but the rest of the compression situation is frustrating. No raises here yet, but if they do, I’m guessing the email will look a lot like Reed Smith’s. Frustrating especially watching Steptoe raise today.

We’ll have to wait and see whether or not these fears are realized on Thursday.

Until then, it’s safe to say that if Venable hoped to put its associates at ease with this pre-announcement, they failed.

# Milbank Climbs Back To The Top Of The Associate Compensation Heap
## You knew they'd do it, but still nice to see.

The firm that got the associate compensation party started has re-entered the building.

That’s right, Milbank — [the first firm to raise associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) — is at it again. If you’ll recall, earlier this month, Milbank set the salary grid at $200,000 for first-year associates but was quickly [outdone by Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/), who went with a slightly higher scale ($202,500 for class of 2021, $205,000 for class of 2020). As expected, Milbank has matched the more generous salaries — well, technically went slightly higher (class of 2021 sees an extra $2,500 at Milbank).

The new and improved salaries are for associates in the U.S., London, Asia, and Sao Paulo and are effective July 1.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Top 10 Firm Smacks Its Associates Across The Face With Money
## An Am Law Top 10 player matches Cravath.

One more firm joins the “Everyone to 180” train. Skadden announced associate raises for all its U.S. offices this afternoon, declining to follow firms like Covington who firmly believe that New York offices [are owed a premium](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-salary-hike-not-all-offices-are-created-equal/). That’s good news for associates working out of some of Skadden’s more provincial offices.

I’m pretty sure with $180K/year you can hire people to ignore your family for you in Houston.

In [a memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/top-5-firm-smacks-its-associates-across-the-face-with-money/2/) just sent out by executive partner [Eric Friedman](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/eric-j-friedman), associates in all of U.S. Skaddenland at least learned that they will indeed be working on the Cravath scale. At least up until the class of ’08 or senior, which tops out at $315K — as opposed to some firms topping out at $325K for ’07 and senior. (We will be revisiting the topic of very senior associates and counsel in a subsequent story; please email us or text us with info and thoughts.)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Not that anyone seriously expected the revenue behemoth — [ranked 4th in the Am Law 100 by gross revenue and revenue per lawyer](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/2/) and [ranked 10th overall by the ATL Power 100](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2015-law-firm-rankings/) — to let something derail its seat at the T14 talent recruiting table.

I love that the memo takes the time to specifically note that associates who aren’t “in good standing” won’t get the raise. Damn. It makes sense, but all I see here is a klaxon telling everyone that there are associates around them.

The memo doesn’t make clear whether or not Skadden is upping the pay of its summer associates. After the market established that norm, to not do so would be, dare we say, a [real slap in the face](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/did-a-biglaw-lawyer-just-get-slapped-by-a-summer-associate/). UPDATE (6/8/16 6:04 p.m.): Tipsters confirm that Skadden did up summer compensation with a separate email.

Enjoy it, Skadden. Full memo [available here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/top-5-firm-smacks-its-associates-across-the-face-with-money/2/).

# Law Schools, Courts Close Ahead Of Hurricane That's Expected To Cause Catastrophic Damage

Hurricane Florence (Photo by NASA via AP)

Justice may be blind, but she’s not stupid. Hurricane Florence is expected to ravage North and South Carolina, and in response, law schools and courts have announced closures in an effort to protect everyone as best they can from the Category 4 storm. We’re sure law firms have closed up shop at their offices as well, but we’ve not yet heard about any weather-related contingency plans from any of the major firms in the area.

According to the [ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/some_north_carolina_courts_announce_closings_as_hurricane_florence_gathers), courts in 40 North Carolina counties are closed or scheduled to close, and South Carolina courts and government offices may post closure announcements soon. [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2018/09/11/hurricane-florence-prompts-law-school-closures-in-the-carolinas/) discusses law school closures in the area:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The Charleston School of Law, which is located within South Carolina’s mandatory evacuation zone, has called off classes and closed campus for the remainder of the week, and plans to reopen on Monday. Further inland in Columbia, the University of South Carolina School of Law canceled classes Tuesday but as of midday Tuesday had yet to announce how long the campus will remain closed. …

None of North Carolina’s six law schools is located on the coast in that state’s evacuation zone, but some have also announced plans to close in preparation for Florence. Classes at the University of North Carolina School of Law are canceled starting at 5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday to allow for students to travel home. Classes are also canceled Wednesday through Friday at North Carolina Central University School of Law. Wake Forest University School of Law [[will hold classes](http://wakealert.wfu.edu/) on Thursday and Friday, but that decision may be subject to change].

Charleston Law spokesman Andy Brack said the school “anticipates weather events, particularly in the fall, so we already have makeup days built into the schedule. The school plans for hurricanes.” For everyone’s safety, we hope the school really planned for Hurricane Florence, because local weather forecasters say the storm surge from Florence could hit record levels of 15 to 20 feet or higher.

Be prepared, be safe, and be kind to those who may need your help. Best of luck to everyone in the legal profession as they try to weather this literal storm.

How is your firm responding to Hurricane Florence? Feel free to email us at [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or send a text message to (646) 820-8477. As always, we’ll keep your name strictly confidential. Thanks!

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Up to now, I have been more behind-the-scenes. But that’s about to change. I have a certain status as the former attorney general. A certain familiarity as the first African-American attorney general. There’s a justified perception that I’m close to President Obama. So I want to use whatever skills I have, whatever notoriety I have, to be effective in opposing things that are, at the end of the day, just bad for the country.

Now is the time to be more visible. Now is the time to be heard.

— Former U.S. Attorney General [Eric Holder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder), who is now working as a partner at [Covington & Burling](https://www.cov.com/en/professionals/h/eric-holder), speaking about his future plans in an interview with [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/eric-holder-joins-anti-trump-resistance-mulls-presidential-campaign-110025091.html?soc_src=mail&soc_trk=ma). Three anonymous sources claimed that Holder was considering running for president as the Democratic contender in 2020.

# Can Biglaw's Best Guide This Law Firm Megamerger To Completion?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Firms will normally employ an outside firm for this. Lawyers are bad at being nonlawyers. Sometimes they will use their own people, but that can get messy.

They announced a name and compensation system early. Those are the things that partners get upset about. Getting that on the table early stems some potential negative reactions from the partners. Some will be upset, but Shearman gets a stronger platform and A&O gets a stronger U.S. presence.

— Brad Hildebrandt, a veteran law firm merger consultant, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/23/deal-watch-davis-polk-simpson-thacher-help-usher-in-3-4b-ao-shearman-deal/) on the [proposed merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/shearman-sterling-allen-overy-merger/) between Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling, praising the firms’ decision to hire top-flight outside counsel like Davis Polk and Simpson Thacher to usher the deal to completion, and other steps they’ve taken to guide the merger to success thus far.

Yesterday, the [legal world was shaken by news](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/seriously-can-we-wait-till-the-fbi-is-done-with-kavanaugh-before-voting-on-his-lifetime-appointment/) that an allegation of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had been referred to the FBI. Senator Diane Feinstein revealed she was in possession of a letter from a woman who detailed an incident allegedly involving Kavanaugh when he was in high school. Feinstein had the letter since July, but she hadn’t shared the contents of the letter with other senators on the Judiciary Committee.

Though initial details of the allegation were vague, in an [article for the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-sexual-misconduct-allegation-against-the-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaugh-stirs-tension-among-democrats-in-congress), Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer were able to uncover the unsettling allegations:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In the letter, the woman alleged that, during an encounter at a party, Kavanaugh held her down, and that he attempted to force himself on her. She claimed in the letter that Kavanaugh and a classmate of his, both of whom had been drinking, turned up music that was playing in the room to conceal the sound of her protests, and that Kavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand.

Kavanaugh and the classmate referenced have offered the following statements:

In a statement, Kavanaugh said, “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.”

Kavanaugh’s classmate said of the woman’s allegation, “I have no recollection of that.”

One question looming over the budding scandal is why, if Senator Feinstein had possession of the letter back in July, did she wait until yesterday to refer it to the FBI and make a statement about it? According to the New Yorker article, the issue observers suspected — privacy for the accuser — played a role, along with what seems like a badly miscalculated political gamble:

Sources familiar with Feinstein’s decision suggested that she was acting out of concern for the privacy of the accuser, knowing that the woman would be subject to fierce partisan attacks if she came forward. Feinstein also acted out of a sense that Democrats would be better off focussing on legal, rather than personal, issues in their questioning of Kavanaugh.

I certainly sympathize with the notion that victims of sexual assault  are hesitant to come forward. Particularly given the magnitude of the stakes, the attacks can get downright brutal — just ask Anita Hill. But… if Feinstein was going to talk about it anyway (it doesn’t appear as though the alleged victim in this case had a last-minute change of heart), it seems Feinstein did the American people a grave disservice by waiting so long. Because this question of character is of utmost importance before we hand a man a lifetime appointment. I don’t want Louis C.K. trying to make me laugh anymore because I know he jerked off in front of women, and I certainly don’t want someone who allegedly held a woman down as she struggled to determine the course of American jurisprudence for the next 40 years. But due to the timing and the partisan nature of the confirmation process, the inquiry into what actually happened will be cut short.

According to the New Yorker, Feinstein’s office also felt the alleged incident was too long ago to be of much use in the confirmation hearings. Even Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee also were kept in the dark about all the details until media inquiries became too numerous:

Feinstein’s decision to handle the matter in her own office, without notifying other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, stirred concern among her Democratic colleagues. For several days, Feinstein declined requests from other Democrats on the Judiciary Committee to share the woman’s letter and other relevant communications. A source familiar with the committee’s activities said that Feinstein’s staff initially conveyed to other Democratic members’ offices that the incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion, and that Feinstein had “taken care of it.” On Wednesday, after media inquiries to the Democratic members multiplied, and concern among congressional colleagues increased, Feinstein agreed to brief the other Democrats on the committee, with no staff present.

It seems other members of the Senate committee were surprised by Feinstein’s handling of the situation as well:

Sources who worked for other members of the Judiciary Committee said that they respected the need to protect the woman’s privacy, but that they didn’t understand why Feinstein had resisted answering legitimate questions about the allegation. “We couldn’t understand what their rationale is for not briefing members on this. This is all very weird,” one of the congressional sources said.

Senate Republicans have denied that they were aware of the substance of these allegations against Kavanaugh before they were made public. However, they also conveniently had ready a letter from 65 women who knew Kavanaugh in high school saying he “behaved honorably and treated women with respect,” as[ John Bresnahan of Politico](https://twitter.com/BresPolitico) tweeted out.

/ 2 ADD – Judiciary Cmte Republicans object to my tweet. GOP aides say they didn’t know the substance of the Feinstein letter or the nature of the allegations. GOP aide also says Judiciary Cmte Rs received updated FBI file on Kavanaugh yesterday after Feinstein letter

But, as others have noted, it seems awfully strange that they just happened to have a letter from 65 people ready to go the day after they supposedly learned of the allegations.

Wait, do you think when Stephen Breyer (3 years after Clarence Thomas) was nominated they had letters from women who knew him in high school or college ready to go???

Of course not!

This is NOT normal.

The Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is scheduled for next Thursday, September 20th.

# World's Richest Biglaw Firm Announces Yet Another ENORMOUS Partnership Class
## With more than 200 new partners, how many of them will enter the firm’s equity ranks?

Kirkland & Ellis is recognized as one the nation’s greatest law firms. Not only does the firm offer a compelling combination of prestige, profitability, and pay, but it continues to shatter the market on partners — in a HUGE way.

Bigger continues to be better at Kirkland, because the firm just announced its largest-ever partner class. We’re not exaggerating when we say this class is absolutely gigantic — 6% larger than last year’s gigantic class, in fact. This year, the firm welcomed a partner class of 205, up from 2022’s then-record class of 193, up from 2021’s then-record class of 151, 2020’s then-record class of 145, 2019’s then-record class of 141, and 2018’s then-record class of 122. Noticing a trend here? Kirkland’s partnership classes have been growing larger every year.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/02/kirkland-crosses-200-in-latest-record-round-of-partner-promotions/) casts the firm’s latest and largest partner class against this time of economic turmoil for other firms:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Despite a difficult year for many elite firms, Kirkland grew in revenue and profits in 2021. The firm grossed roughly $6.5 billion in 2022, and increased profits per partner to around $7.5 million, while increasing its partner and overall lawyer headcount. Significant litigation work, a second-half jump in restructuring and solid middle-market performance helped keep the firm humming despite a difficult global deal environment.

But how many of these new partners will enter the firm’s equity ranks? In 2021, for example, Kirkland had 490 equity partners and 763 nonequity partners. The firm recently made it easier for nonequity partners to become equity partners (down from four years as a salaried partner to three), but it’s still quite difficult to make equity at the firm.

As far as diversity is concerned, Kirkland opted once again [not to show photos](https://www.kirkland.com/news/press-release/2023/10/kirkland-ellis-announces-new-partners) of its new partnership class. In the past, the firm’s new partners were looking mighty male and mighty white. It’s important for firms to know that these subjects won’t go unnoticed. Diversity and inclusion matter — to a firm’s current lawyers, to potential recruits, and perhaps most importantly, to clients.

What better way to pass a Friday afternoon than gawking at Biglaw bonuses?

Akin Gump, a firm that took in $1,220,204,000 in gross revenue last year making it #38 on the Am Law 100, announced their bonuses this week. And as per the prevailing expectations, they matched the market bonuses making their way through Biglaw.

The bonus grid is as follows:



“Exceptional” performance will be rewarded with even bigger bonus numbers.

The firm’s productivity expectation is 1950 hours which includes a variety of billable and non-billable activities. Bonuses will be paid in February. You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/akin-bonus-22/2/)

Do your legal clients think you’re a competent attorney? The results might just surprise you.

In this study, our friends at Infotrack found 1,036 people who have hired an attorney or legal aid group in the past year and asked them about their experiences.

Then, they crunched the data to find out:

- What your legal clients expect from you.
- How things like case type, age, and the nature of the legal issue impact your clients’ expectations.
- What clients think of their attorneys’ legal and technological competence?
- How your tech skills impact the overall client experience.

# This Is Where The Recruiting Power Lies
## If law schools want to step up and protect law students via recruiting guidelines, now is the time.

As a child of the 1980s and 90s, it should come as no real surprise that in my youth, I was a fan of professional wrestling.  In fact, the first substantive piece (i.e., not a comment on a Prodigy-era message board) I had published on the internet was a wrestling column — thankfully, it was written under a pseudonym and the website is seemingly no longer active, which prevents me from having to buy the site and then take all the hard drives to an open field and literally [light them on fire](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9keb4d/bang-bros-bought-pornwikileaks-doxing-forum-and-set-fire-to-it).  In a sentence that will probably make no sense to anyone under the age of 30, I can remember being driven down to the local Blockbuster video store so I could pick out a WWF (yes, before they [lost their litigation battle](https://www.cagesideseats.com/2012/8/22/3259376/wwe-and-world-wildlife-fund-reach-a-settlement) with the World Wildlife Fund) VHS tape that I would watch on a loop until it was time to return it and pick out another.

While probably the most recognizable figure in the industry during this period, I was never a fan of Hulk Hogan.  At the time, my dislike stemmed mainly from thinking his workrate was subpar, at best — teenage me would have preferred a Ric Flair or Bret Hart match any day of the week; as an adult, I harbor a good amount of resentment for [his role](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/02/hogan-thiel-gawker-trial/554132/) in the destruction of the beloved [Gawker](https://gawker.com/gawker-com-to-end-operations-next-week-1785455712).  But while not a personal favorite, there is one Hogan promo that sticks out in my mind to this day.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  

I have been thinking about “where the power lies” in recent days as the “Fall” Recruiting Cycle has wound down.  This year’s iteration was the first following the abandonment of the NALP Guidelines in an action that increasingly strikes me as the most stunning act of abdication since [Edward VIII](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/edward-viii-abdicates).[[1]](#_ftn1)  In this post-Guidelines world, many are wondering which entity, law firms or law schools, is going to hold greater sway in setting the new rules for legal recruiting.  It seems axiomatic for many that the power will be held by the firms, if for no other reason than they have the jobs.  While I guarantee this is not a tryout for [The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/2019/9/10/20857909/introducing-the-hottest-take), my hot take is I think that reasoning is backward.  It is law schools — especially the most elite institutions — that can mold the future of legal recruiting if they want to.

So what makes me hold this contrary view?  First and foremost, a simple matter of math.  Per the [American Bar Association](http://www.abarequireddisclosures.org/EmploymentOutcomes.aspx), there were 3,703 graduating J.D. students in the Class of 2018 at the top 10 law schools as most recently ranked by [U.S. News](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings), and in fact, the number of schools is actually 12 given the three-way tie for 10th place in the rankings.  When you look at the infamous T14, the number of graduating students grows to 4,549, mainly because Georgetown Law is roughly the size of a G7 nation.  Expanding the list to the U.S. News top 20 gives us 5,933 students.  In comparison, over the last decade, [Chambers Associate](https://www.chambers-associate.com/law-firms/law-firm-intake-sizes) has tracked the number of incoming associates at a collection of 76 law firms.  For 2019, that figure was 4,070, a figure that does not include a number of Am Law 25 firms that Chambers does not track including: Baker McKenzie ([31](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/baker-mckenzie-llp) post-grad offers made in Summer 2018), Norton Rose ([61](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/norton-rose-fulbright) offers in 2018), Quinn Emanuel ([20](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/quinn-emanuel-urquhart-sullivan-llp) offers in 2018), and Paul Hastings ([75](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/paul-hastings-llp) offers in 2018).  Including those firms gives us 4,257 first-year associate slots and adding the rest of the Am Law 50 firms not on the Chambers list[[2]](#_ftn2) takes the associate figure to 4,775.

So while not an apples to apples comparison (Class of 2018 vs. placements in the Fall of 2019), the evidence shows that T14 graduates are outpaced by the needs of the country’s elite law firms and these Biglaw slots constitute more than 80 percent of the top-20 graduating class.  This disparity between Biglaw demand and top school supply only grows when one realizes that not every top-20 law school graduate wants to go into Biglaw.  When you consider students who wish to go into private practice in smaller markets, to say nothing of those who want to go into public interest, chasm develops.  In the world of supply and demand, it’s hard to say that the consumer (i.e., law firms) have the dominant hand when their demand outstrips the supply of top-20 law students.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
While this might sound merely theoretical, the early evidence indicates that it is, indeed, law schools, that are taking charge in this post-Guidelines world.  NALP has created [a portal](https://www.nalp.org/recruiting_policies) for both law schools and firms to provide the recruiting guidelines for their own institution, help in a world where national law schools and firms have to keep track of possibly dozens upon dozens of different guidelines, each with varying provisions.  Currently, 25 law schools, including eight of the top-20 (Yale, Harvard, Chicago, UVA, Northwestern, Berkeley, UCLA, and USC) have posted their guidelines to the portal, while other schools have made theirs available on their website, see, e.g., [Columbia](https://www.law.columbia.edu/career-services/employers/policies-and-guidelines-applicable-employers).  On the other hand, a grand total of one law firm has posted its guidelines to the portal.  Now, does this mean that firms have completely ceded the post-Guidelines world to schools?  No, nor does the fact that law school guidelines exist mean that they are necessarily being adhered to by law firms in legal hiring — though anecdotally, I have been contacted by a number of firms during the “Fall” cycle asking about Vanderbilt’s policy and subsequently adhering to its provisions.  But what this does show is which entity has started to step up and fill the Guidelines void.

Many of you might be reading this and think, who cares?  Why does it matter where the power lies in the recruiting world?  Well, as consternation regarding a “Fall” Recruiting Cycle that starts earlier and earlier in July grows louder after every recruiting cycle, it is important to recognize who could do something to counteract this constant push forward on the calendar, and correct other aspects of legal recruiting that are working against the interest of law students, and the answer is top law schools.

In talking with Vanderbilt students, one of the most frequent metaphors I employ is to compare junior Biglaw associates as grist for the law firm.  But it turns out that the mill cannot make flour without grist, thus, whoever controls the grist holds the future of the mill in their hands.  If some want to step up and protect law students via recruiting guidelines, now is the time.

[[1]](#_ftnref1) Yes, I know that the Department of Justice [similarly targeted](https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2019/09/03/admissions-association-says-it-must-pull-measures-ethics-code-avoid) the National Association for College Admission Counseling with threats of antitrust litigation based on alleged anti-competitive provisions in their ethics code —  provisions that were designed to, and seemingly did, protect students and serve their best interests.  I am still unconvinced.  While the furthest thing from an antitrust scholar, even if the antitrust case against the NALP Guidelines was airtight, I am reminded of the old poker chestnut, “play the man, not the cards.”  I like my odds in any litigation if institutions such as Harvard and Latham & Watkins are aligned with, rather than opposing, me.

# To Embed Or Not?
## Business people don’t understand ethical issues that lawyers labor under. The reality is that not every issue can be solved with a snap of the fingers.

To decentralize or not? That is the question that many general counsels are asking these days. Business peeps, CEOs, and the like are pushing for in-house lawyers to be, for lack of a better word, “embedded” in various departments that they advise and represent in matters. According to [a survey by Axiom](https://www.axiomlaw.com/hubfs/Downloadable%20Marketing%20Content/The%20Axiom%20Survey%20on%20Legal%20Department%20Organization_Key%20Findings.pdf), many general counsels think that their legal departments are not structured in ways that meet the business needs of the entity.

Of the approximately 300 general counsels surveyed, most say they will be making structural changes in their legal departments to align with the needs of the various corporate units more closely. What will that mean? Almost two-thirds of the respondents favor a basically centralized legal department but with 15% of lawyers embedded in business units. Not an overwhelming response to the idea of decentralization. Only 3% want their departments completely centralized and a piddling 1% favor total decentralization.

This is not a new issue: 30 years ago, the thought was that placing lawyers in business units could save time and money and prompt quicker responses from a legal team that was often seen as a bunch of “Dr. Nos,” or who hid behind lengthy legal analyses that did not provide the strategic legal guidance wanted and needed.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Business people don’t understand ethical issues that lawyers labor under. (I’m not trying to be patronizing here, but that’s the reality.) Business people want quick answers to pressing issues, and I get that and got that when I was in-house. But the reality is that not every issue can be solved with a snap of the fingers or a department head saying “Don’t worry about that.” Good lawyers do and should worry. It’s in every lawyer’s DNA or should be. It’s our job to worry, not only about giving correct legal advice in a timely manner, but also about the ethical boundaries that limit and constrain what we do and how we do it. The business people may sleep well at night, but we don’t necessarily share that same restful sleep.

We have dual responsibilities that clients usually don’t understand. Yes, we are to provide zealous representation on behalf of the clients, but we are also officers of the court, and that responsibility carries with it a whole different set of responsibilities and obligations. If the client admits to perjury while testifying, her lawyer has certain obligations that may well supersede the attorney/client relationship. If the client insists on a trial strategy that creates a conflict between the two that cannot be resolved, the attorney must withdraw, without disclosing the nature of the conflict.

What about loyalty? A business peep asks the embedded in-house to perform a task that she considers unethical. What should she do, especially if the business person tells her not to inform the general counsel? What if she is given an assignment that could result in substantial liability to the entity? What if she tells the business person that a course of conduct has a potential legal violation? Is she more loyal to the business unit than to the entity? Doesn’t she have the obligation, essentially a “greater good,” to advise the general counsel about the issue?

How many business people understand the cost of discovery and its disputes? How many business people understand what a dispositive motion is? How many business people know how to negotiate legal fees and the disputes that almost always arise? They don’t know the terminology; they are clueless about how long a matter should take and what it should cost. How to explain to a CEO why a matter cost so much if the business people don’t understand legal costs and the department head wants “no stone left unturned?” How many times has an in-house counsel, trying to resolve a matter, heard “You’re taking their side?” from the business people? Too many times to count.

And if embedded in a business unit, do those lawyers have the necessary detachment and objectivity to push back against ideas that make no sense or that will create substantial legal risk, just to placate the business person who now will write that attorney’s review and make compensation recommendations?

One of the issues that in-house lawyers have always confronted are the silos of business units. Limited or no sharing of information, of ideas, of how to improve efficiencies. As an [article in Legal Dive about the Axiom report](https://www.legaldive.com/news/hybrid-teams-make-in-house-lawyers-more-business-focused-axiom-decentralized-legal-general-counsel/696079/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Issue:%202023-10-12%20Legal%20Dive%20%5Bissue:55385%5D&utm_term=Legal%20Dive) points out, general counsel “feel that having legal operations under their control optimizes in-house and external spend, has the strongest corporate governance and universal legal operations standards, allows for great flexibility in the deployment of resources, best mitigates risk and enables greater efficiency across business units and geographies.” What about the risks that arise when embedded lawyers are advocates, rather than detached advisors?

Does a decentralized legal department make sense? As we lawyers like to say, “It depends.”

# More Partners Join $300 Million Biglaw Gender Discrimination Lawsuit
## Three more former partners at Ogletree allege unequal pay at the firm.

[Earlier this year,](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/am-law-100-firm-hit-with-300-million-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/) the Am Law 100 firm — with a thriving Labor and Employment practice — of [Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart](https://ogletree.com/) was hit with a $300 million purported class-action by nonequity shareholder Dawn Knepper, alleging gender discrimination and unequal pay. Now, three other other former nonequity partners are joining the lawsuit.

Jocelyn Campanaro, Angelica Ochoa, and Alicia Voltmer have added their stories about working at Ogletree in an amended complaint filed May 11th. The amended complaint alleges that the work that women partners tend to do at the firm is not the work that is rewarded by origination credit or otherwise tied to their compensation:

As female shareholders draft briefs, supervise younger lawyers and non-lawyer staff, and handle a broad range of client demands, the firm selects male shareholders for pitch meetings, conferences, and other business development opportunities that enable those male shareholders to reap origination credit, management credit, and other compensation that is disproportionate to their contributions.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The amended complaint alleges this has a direct — and negative — impact on the pay and promotion of women attorneys at the firm.

Representing the plaintiffs is the firm of Sanford Heisler Sharp, which is carving out a [niche for themselves](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/david-sanford/) suing Biglaw firms over gender discrimination. As Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/14/more-women-accuse-ogletree-of-gender-bias-in-300m-suit/), David Sanford has indicated they’ve gotten a lot of feedback from current and former Ogletree partners:

“Many current and former shareholders have reached out to our firm to discuss their experiences while at Ogletree.”

According to the amended complaint, the firm is aware of the pay disparity between genders and the unequal opportunities, but has not done anything to rectify the situation:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“Ogletree leadership fosters or condones a firm culture that marginalizes, demeans, and undervalues women,” the amended complaint said. “Ogletree’s leadership is aware of the firm’s inequitable pay, promotion, job assignment, and other practices, but have taken no steps to remedy the root causes of the disparity.”

This is a claim Ogletree disputes in a recent statement about the lawsuit:

“Equal opportunity has been a core principle of Ogletree Deakins since the firm’s founding, and we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind—gender or otherwise. We take the allegations filed by former shareholders very seriously,” the statement said. “However, the decision-making process that governs our compensation system is both fair and equitable. In fact, we are proud of our ‘open compensation’ system under which all shareholders in the firm know what every other shareholder earns—and the factors that support those determinations.”

Additionally, the firm pointed out that over the past four years, the majority of attorneys promoted to shareholder have been women, and there’s been increased representation of women in firm leadership positions.

# Biglaw Partners Should Think Like Franchise Owners
## It’s a common refrain even from highly successful lawyers: 'I wish I were on the business side.'

It’s a common refrain even from highly successful lawyers: “I wish I were on the business side.”

There can be more than one motivation underlying that sentiment. The chance to earn more money tends to be part of the appeal, particularly if the lawyer is treating an especially successful client as the reference point. But beyond money, attorneys who yearn for a business role are often drawn to the notion of managing a P&L. In other words, they like the idea of being in charge of a business and controlling their destiny.

The thing is, if you are a Biglaw partner, you’re already running a business: your practice. It might not feel that way. Maybe you view your firm’s managing partner as the person who is running the business, and relative to that leader, you feel like you don’t have much management autonomy. If that is your view, it may be worth considering that most of the clients on the “business side” are constrained by decisions made higher up the pyramid. Not all of them are CEOs. Many are leaders of divisions within a broader corporate structure, managing a P&L that is just one component of a larger whole.

But the best analogy for law firm partners isn’t to a corporate division. It’s to a franchise. A law firm partner is effectively a franchise owner. At first glance, running a capital markets practice looks vastly different from running a fast food restaurant. But if you set aside the surface differences, there are some fundamental similarities.

In a franchise model, the franchisor determines many details of the franchisee’s operation. The franchisor defines the brand in the public imagination through marketing campaigns. It controls the menu of products sold at the franchises. It supervises the design and construction of stores to maintain a common look and feel across the brand’s outlets. And it provides instructions and training to ensure a consistent customer experience.

But although the broad strategic and design choices are primarily the domain of the franchisor, the franchisee controls the actual operation of the business and ultimately determines whether it succeeds. The franchisee’s responsibilities include hiring employees and supervising their work, building the reputation of the franchise in the community it serves, and carefully tracking the performance of the franchise relative to industry benchmarks to identify opportunities for improvement.

A law firm’s management, like a franchisor, is the primary steward of the brand under which the firm’s partners offer their services. The managing partner or management committee determines which practice areas the firm will compete in, selects the partners who will lead service delivery in those practice areas, and sets the broad policies and cultural norms by which the firm operates.

To be sure, those are all important decisions. But the success of the firm’s business is ultimately contingent on client satisfaction, and that depends on the management skills of the individual partners. As a partner, your job is to bring in matters and execute on them such that the client’s expectations are met or exceeded.

Like a franchise owner, you are responsible for your practice, and it will grow primarily through your direct efforts. It’s on you to get out there and interact with influential members of the community, and it’s on you to ensure that the team of associates working under your direction is motivated and equipped to deliver on your promises to clients. Like a diligent franchise owner, you should be monitoring the performance of your practice relative to others, taking stock of its relative strengths and weaknesses, and gleaning insights that can be leveraged to drive continuous improvement. You don’t need to shift to the “business side.” You’re already on it.

# 40 Percent Of Law Firms Haven't Raised Rates... It's Probably Time
## Almost a third of the Am Law 100 have stood on rates as inflation crept up.

With legal services [demand taking a hit last quarter](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/for-all-the-layoff-talk-most-law-firms-are-holding-steady-and-banking-on-swift-recovery/), some predict doom and gloom for Biglaw. But many more see the rebounding economy and an opportunity to recoup a bad Q4 with some timely rate increases. Will ratcheting up the bills finally backfire, or will companies publicly carp about it and then fork over the cash like they do every time?

[Wolters Kluwer ELM Solutions](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/solutions/enterprise-legal-management) just issued its LegalVIEW Insights report and for all the complaints, law firms haven’t raised rates that much at all. Based on data from corporate law departments and insurance claims departments through the LegalVIEW Data Warehouse, the Insights report found that around 40 percent of timekeepers generally — and approximately 32 percent of the Am Law 100’s timekeepers — received no rate increases at all during the reference period from July 2021 to June 2022.

The mean law firm rate increase was about 5.6 percent and the median was 1.9 percent, hardly bank breaking and well below even the flattening rate of inflation.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Not that all practice areas are created equal:



What a testament to the dereliction of government responsibility over the prior four years! Still, remove that hike and law firm rate changes are even more mild.

While the report suggests that law firms have some slack they can call upon with a rate hike or two, there’s a note of caution for firms too:

The large, white-shoe firms of the Am Law 100, in contrast, have clearly not been trained to expect meager rate increases, and as of this writing, their clients seem more afraid of them ending the relationship, rather than the other way around. This despite the fact that it is almost certainly true that clients fire or discontinue relationships with law firms far more often than law firms fire their clients.

The report notes that 13 percent of timekeepers overall saw the average rate they charge across all clients decrease. What does that mean? Either they lost a high rate client or brought on lower paying clients or both. One interpretation of this development is that some of the industry’s largest firms will work for less than what many of their clients are willing to pay. If that’s true, corporate legal departments at small and big firms alike hold more pricing power over large firms than they may realize.

And that power is arguably stronger over the bigger firms:

One might object that the pricing power of the big firms is so great they are immovable, and there are no savings to be had with them by negotiating rates. But the data suggests this just isn’t the case. Even in the Am Law 100, approximately 32% of timekeepers got no rate increase at all in the reference period. Rate increases are not, as the defeatists would argue, always inevitable and always inevitably high, although they are more likely to be both in the case of a buyer with a lackadaisical approach to rate management.

It’s certainly possible, and clients will likely secure discounts and write-offs in the negotiating process, but I’m still inclined to believe that firms still have the upper hand. In fact, firms may have more leverage to raise rates now than ever. The [growth of ALSPs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/as-law-firms-start-layoffs-alternative-legal-services-providers-grow-like-gangbusters/) may take work away from the firms, but it also supercharges the firm’s argument that they deserve a premium for doing the work that can’t be replaced by technology and cheaper labor.

Coupled with a trend line showing rates lagging behind inflation for years ([especially among smaller firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/lawyers-should-raise-their-rates/)), there’s ample reason for firms to demand more from clients. And while clients have tools at their disposal to push back, the firm should have the better case.

It will be an interesting fight though.

# 'Mo Money Mo Problems' -- 2022 Reprise
## If your new salary seems too good to be true, it probably is.

Yet again, the associate salary market has been in an absolute frenzy. Barely [six months](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) after raising all their associate classes by $10,000 to $15,000 per year, Milbank upped the ante in late January [one more time](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/). First- through fourth-year attorneys saw another $10,000 added to their annual salaries, while midlevels and seniors moved up $20,000.

Milbank shifted the market both last year and this year, inspiring a wave of matching moves throughout the upper echelons of private law. But even those massive leaps in compensation haven’t ended the upward trend. In February, elite boutique Brewer, Attorneys & Counselors out-Milbanked Milbank and announced [$235,000 starting salaries for first years](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/brewer-2022-raise/), with commensurate raises for their senior classes and nonattorney professionals. And then just this Wednesday, megafirm Davis Polk & Wardwell [surged into the market lead](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/?fbclid=IwAR0J7aMP45hLqQc4iN_knbaHIxcnFr5JIvIwZ7LuG5qEad8j1VqaTsBKIUY), matching the Milbank scale for junior associates and exceeding it for mid-levels and seniors.

How long Davis Polk’s lead lasts will be anyone’s guess. If you’ve tried to hire lateral attorneys in the past year or two, you’re well aware the market for legal labor remains blisteringly hot. Salaries and signing bonuses that would have seemed absurd in the 2010s are now common. It’s not that Biglaw has suddenly decided to raise associate salaries out of the goodness of its heart. Demand for legal services continues to be high coming out of the pandemic-driven blip of a recession we experienced in 2020. Deals keep getting done and lawsuits keep getting filed at tremendous rates, and so demand for associates to handle the laboring oar on those matters has driven salaries up and up.

As a former associate myself, part of me is deeply happy to see the laws of supply and demand are working in their favor. But the law firm manager in me is frankly worried. I’ve written about the problems behind these raises [time](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/mo-money-mo-problems-2/) and [time again](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/mo-money-mo-problems-again/). While the sky may not have fallen yet, we’re starting to see stress fractures on the Biglaw model that could lead to bigger problems.

Where’s This Money Coming From?

There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Funds for associate raises have to come from somewhere. Generally, it’s from some combination of (1) the firm’s ownership agreeing to take a smaller cut of profits to fund higher salaries, (2) the firm raising rates and risking angering their clients, or (3) the firm increasing its expectations for associate performance. No partner likes the idea of cutting their own take-home, leaving Option 1 dead in the water at many firms. Clients are [already complaining about](https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/01/150k-junior-lawyer-salaries-are-out-of-control-top-general-counsel-warns/) paying exorbitant rates to help firms maintain their associate salaries, meaning raising rates under Option 2 remains unattractive. Because the money is being used to fund associate raises anyway, most firms ultimately turn to Option 3. Associates get a bigger workload to match their slightly larger check.

The problem here is that Option 3, increasing associate expectations, isn’t remotely sustainable in the long run. It’s arguably been unsustainable for the past several years. Biglaw associates were already experiencing burnout and turnover at tremendous rates before the pandemic due to the crushing expectations needed to keep up with their old salaries. Biglaw already demands peak human levels of mental fortitude to keep churning away billing thousands of hours a year. Mental health issues such as [depression and substance abuse](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/rehab-guide/workforce/white-collar/lawyers) are already rampant. Our associates need more time away from work, not less.

Most firms feel compelled to raise their own salaries to match their competitors in lockstep. Although that’s economically rational for individual firm actors, for the industry as a whole it’s madness. Raising salaries in lockstep pushes us further down the path toward a culture of overwork and burnout.

A Balloon Ready To Pop?

Beyond just being unsustainable as a matter of the associates themselves, it’s also worth examining whether these new raises can bear the massive economic uncertainty into which we are currently hurtling. Just as Biglaw is committing to higher spending levels, demand for legal services appears to be [beginning to soften](https://www.law.com/pro/2021/07/26/is-demand-for-legal-services-really-that-high-a-closer-look-at-rpl-and-head-count-data/). Macroeconomic indicators are also looking less than encouraging. Inflation [hit 7% over 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/12/cpi-december-2021-.html), the fastest rise in 40 years, and appears ready to continue shooting upward. The Fed is trying to somehow [thread the needle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/02/18/recession-risks-are-rising-as-federal-reserve-scrambles-to-fight-inflation-experts-say/?sh=78a7c5be2e65) of cooling off inflation by raising interest rates without simultaneously triggering a recession. Then there’s the ongoing Ukraine situation, which at a minimum will impact energy prices for the foreseeable future — and there are many other worse scenarios that are possible. There are any number of reasons there could be a correction or a full-blown recession on the horizon.

When the economy as a whole suffers, our industry generally suffers with it. Anyone affected by these latest rounds of the salary wars almost certainly wouldn’t have been in the industry when the 2009 crash hit. I was an associate during those times. [It was brutal](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/what-the-2009-legal-layoffs-were-really-like/). At Biglaw firms across the country, practice groups were slashed and burned, offers of new employment were rescinded, and even tenured attorneys unexpectedly found themselves packing up their desks and hunting for work amid a crush of thousands of other unemployed lawyers. Our industry needed most of the following decade just to get back to where it had started.

The consensus history today is that law firms of the mid-2000s were bloated and inefficient, frittering away their budgets on any number of things they didn’t need, including excess headcount and exorbitant associate salaries. Firms weren’t keeping themselves lean, weren’t preparing for any potential bumps in the road, and were depending on times staying fat and bountiful to keep the whole thing running.

If all of this sounds ominous, you’re right.

Where We Go From Here

The question is one of mindset. A firm that’s blindly raising salaries trying to keep up with the Joneses without putting thought into whether those salaries are sustainable is the kind of firm that’s going to suffer most when the downturn hits. Firm leaders need to take a deep breath, take a break from the bidding wars, and look more deeply at some of the warning signs. Firms need to acknowledge and plan for that risk before agreeing to push associate salaries further.

I’m not urging us to pay associates less. I’m urging thoughtfulness and open communication. I think many associates would appreciate being told directly that their firm leaders were consciously choosing to step back from the base salary wars in favor of more balance. And, hey, if billables remain bountiful, nothing stops the firm from cutting bonus checks that could put their associates ahead of the competition in terms of actual take-home. What’s important is that, if and when the coming downturn happens, we don’t find our industry committed to promises it can no longer honor.

Since the spring of 2020, lawyers have steadily built up the resources and routines that allow them to thrive at work while working from home.

Now, many expect remote work to continue as part of whatever industry standard may emerge. 

In this series, we’re taking you behind the videoconference, showing the home office set-ups of professionals throughout the legal industry. 

Our series includes the distractions, hobbies, and other activities that make up the remote workplace, to benchmark your own setup while gathering a few tips from your peers. 

In this edition, we visit the home offices of Orrick lawyers Laura Brooks Najemy and Matthew LaBrie. Want to share how you’ve adapted? [Click here to participate](https://breakingmedia.wufoo.com/forms/xiuybj21a48c2w/). 

Matthew LaBrie, Managing Associate, Orrick

ATL: Describe your office decor in one sentence.

Piles of papers and “Alice in Wonderland”-esque stacks of coffee cups with sticky notes on every surface.

What office equipment do you use to complete your day-to-day work?

Two monitors, laptop, iPad, Peloton, red pen, yellow highlighter.

What key pieces of office furniture do you use?

Nothing special: desk and chair.



What work adjacent equipment helps?

I have a portable external monitor and a “[MiFi](https://rstyle.me/+m-uaiN39GbS1S7823yLMgw)” that lets me be mobile yet still work efficiently when I can’t use my home office.

Any videoconference fashion must-haves?

I have a [dark blue Lululemon zip up jacket](https://rstyle.me/+1SCoOzeVK-l6ocEkMONMcw) with a high collar I can throw on over anything in a video-call-emergency. It’s formal enough to look like I dressed with intention for the video call.

What are your biggest meeting-bomb risks?

I’m more terrified of not being on mute than of an unexpected cameo. I always dial in through my phone so I can double mute: mute the computer and mute the phone.

What is your go-to publication or website for taking a breather?

[NYT Recipes](https://cooking.nytimes.com/) (and [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/)).

What are your favorite physical books in your background (or nearby)?

Well, on my virtual background, I have a library’s worth of book shelves behind me. In real life, it’s the Blue Book and [Obama’s latest book](https://rstyle.me/+CYObNKKjM570iEsTI9ReTg), which I keep trying to finally finish.

Laura Brooks Najemy, Senior Associate

Describe your office decor in one sentence.

“Business casual” — i.e., guest bedroom partially turned into full-time office. 

What office equipment do you use to complete your day-to-day work?

Laptop with built-in camera for Zoom calls, two external monitors, wireless mouse and keyboard, soft-lit desk lights, and — most important — a [Mr. Coffee electric coffee cup warmer](https://rstyle.me/+W1-FZs_CfkAOL4j-WucxeQ).

What key pieces of office furniture do you use?

Corner desk, rolling chair, and file organizers on both sides of the desk. 

What work adjacent equipment helps?

The ease of being able to go downstairs to get a snack from my kitchen or to make a second (or third) cup of coffee in my [Nespresso machine](https://rstyle.me/+F8Cs6STGosv-R11d6-PPxQ) is certainly helpful on a day-to-day basis!



Any videoconference fashion must-haves?

I find videoconferences amazing because of the comfortable fashion choices that I can make that are always off-camera — i.e., leggings! 

What are your biggest meeting-bomb risks?

My two cats who seem to like to jump up on my desk and knock things over or shove papers around at precisely the least opportune moments. 

What is your go-to publication or website for taking a breather?

I tend to find myself checking my personal email when I need a break and catching up on the news through NY Times or Boston Globe alerts or [the Skimm](https://www.theskimm.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidmedia&utm_campaign=Brand_Tier%201_Exact&gclid=CjwKCAjwt8uGBhBAEiwAayu_9TcnAbDGd3LhufIiOxUdh4HqU7jpzDXj23jNfjyo20smVQqznfhZnhoCE6MQAvD_BwE). 

What are your favorite physical books in your background (or nearby)?

There is a bookshelf full of books next to my desk in my “home office,” but the title that always makes me chuckle is [“How To Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting To Kill You.”](https://rstyle.me/+F0kAyI4cuvFdoyqwn9b5Aw)

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.
