# Charting The Rise Of Legal Financing

Over the past decade, legal financing has evolved from a niche market into a significant industry, fueled by its growing popularity, innovative new players, and evolving regulatory frameworks. It has overcome initial hurdles and criticisms to become a vital strategic and financial tool for litigants and law firms. Currently, we are partnering with a leading legal finance company to fill a [Head of Tax](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3877871792) position in New York, making this an opportune moment to review the industry’s progress over the last 10 years since I [last wrote about it](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/is-litigation-financing-the-future-of-law/). Further details about the job and application process can be found at the end of this article.

Legal financing initially rose out of necessity due to rules governing champerty and maintenance in the United States. The concept of champerty derives from ancient Greece and Rome and is defined as the splitting of fees between the litigating party and a nonparty who funds or supports the lawsuit. Maintenance, the second offense, is the interjection of a third party who wields undue influence on a case. The two are intertwined and were codified in English Common Law to prevent the English elite from furthering and profiting from the lawsuits of commoners by overwhelming the courts with their clout.

Despite early concerns that legal financing would encourage frivolous litigation, the reality has been significantly more favorable. By funding meritorious claims under a non-recourse model, where repayment is contingent on the case’s success, financing firms have introduced a rigorous evaluation process to select cases with a strong likelihood of success, generally requiring at least a 60% chance of winning. Biglaw itself has become a champion of the industry, with 35% of commitments originating from Biglaw firms in 2023, compared to 28% in 2022. 

The industry has outperformed even the most optimistic forecasts from 2019. With assets under management reaching $9.6 billion in 2019, projections anticipated growth to $15 billion by 2025 based on an 8.3% compound annual growth rate. Remarkably, this milestone was achieved by 2022, three years ahead of schedule. Although 2023 saw a plateau in overall industry growth, many companies continued to expand at a steady rate. This plateau is attributed to broader financial market trends rather than a decline in demand for legal financing services, and a slight reduction in the number of funding firms from 44 in 2022 to 39 2023.



The Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have undeniably impacted the broader economy, including the legal financing sector. Specific segments, particularly those dealing with lower-risk credit transactions or significant mass tort agreements, have felt the pressure of rising interest rates on [deal feasibility and pricing](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/us-litigation-funding-state-flux-deal-commitments-dip-says-report-2024-03-27/). Notably, such agreements have experienced either an uptick in capital costs or the introduction of clauses designed to shield investors from future rate fluctuations.

However, the industry is poised for continued growth, driven by its attractiveness as an investment that offers potential [counter-market benefits.](https://www.crowell.com/a/web/5fSLXXf6Jc8nKLQTaWgf8V/4Ttkbd/20211210-recent-trends-in-litigation-finance.pdf) Legal finance firms engage in the acquisition of claims against both solvent and insolvent entities, with the ultimate value of these claims being closely tied to the litigation outcomes — whether the company is the plaintiff or the defendant. The structure of traditional funding agreements usually incorporates a “waterfall” mechanism, which prioritizes the return on the initial capital investments. This prioritization ensures that the foundational risk associated with these investments is kept to a minimum. Once the initial capital has been recouped, profits are then shared between the funder and the law firm or plaintiff involved in the claim, with the financing party generally receiving a preferential share of the returns. This strategic approach to investment and profit distribution underscores the industry’s potential for growth, backed by a model that mitigates risk while maximizing returns.

Interest in legal funding has expanded beyond financial investments to encompass a growing professional engagement within the sector. The establishment of the International Legal Finance Association in 2020 marked a significant milestone, highlighting the industry’s concerted effort to champion its interests and foster a collaborative environment. Further demonstrating this trend, the inaugural LITFINCON event took place in 2022, attracting attorneys nationwide to Houston. These developments signify a deepening professional engagement, facilitating dialogue, and collaboration across the legal community. These platforms enhance the industry’s stature and cohesion, reflecting a commitment to collective advancement.

Towards the end of the 2010s, the insurance sector recognized a burgeoning demand for its offerings within the legal financing landscape, leading to the introduction of products like judgment preservation insurance aimed at safeguarding against decision reversals. This move highlights the insurance industry’s position as the more risk-averse segment within legal financing. As legal finance entities have [progressively yielded](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/insurers-invade-litigation-finance-boosting-law-firm-options) this particular market space to insurance firms, a new equilibrium concerning market share distribution appears to have been established. This shift underscores the evolving dynamics between legal financing and insurance companies, reflecting a strategic realignment and mutual adaptation that benefits the broader legal and financial ecosystem.

Concerns that regulatory measures might hinder the growth of the legal financing industry have, to a large extent, been mitigated by the relatively narrow reach of judicial decisions impacting the sector. The enactment of[ S.B. 269 by Montana Governor Greg Gianforte](https://litigationfinancejournal.com/montana-enacts-new-legislation-regulating-third-party-litigation-funding-in-the-state/) exemplifies a push towards greater transparency within legal financing, mandating enhanced disclosure requirements for funders. Further regulatory efforts include [standing orders](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2023/06/07/us-judges-rule-legal-finance-may-not-be-discussed-at-trial/) issued by Chief U.S. District Judge Colm Connolly of the District of Delaware, focusing on third-party litigation funding and patent ownership. Despite these initiatives, some judges have deemed such disclosures irrelevant or have outright rejected these mandates, suggesting that the industry’s operational norms may remain largely unchanged. This landscape indicates a nuanced regulatory environment where efforts to increase transparency and oversight coexist with a judicial inclination to maintain existing practices.

# Some Lawyers Have Surge Pricing
## One of the easiest ways to increase the likelihood of snagging additional client work is to lower prices.

A few weeks ago, I published an article detailing some situations in which it [might make sense for a lawyer to charge different rates to different clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/when-is-it-fair-to-charge-different-clients-different-rates/). So long as the rate charged by a lawyer is reasonable, lawyers have flexibility to charge varying rates based on the type of work they handle, their own experience, and other factors. One interesting practice of some lawyers is to charge clients more those lawyers are busier than if they have less work to perform. Similar to pricing policies with rideshare companies, some lawyers may fluctuate their fees based on the surge in demand for their services across the day.

I first saw this phenomenon when I was an associate at a midsized law firm. One of the partners asked me to sit in on a meeting with a new client, which was a real treat since I’d never had that experience before, and I wanted to know what it was like to communicate with clients during onboarding. We discussed the matter at hand with the client, and eventually, the topic of fees came up. The partner said that he would charge the new client significantly more than we typically charged other clients.

I asked the partner why, and he explained that the firm was busy and that this emboldened the partner to charge more money. If the client walked, the firm would not really struggle since we were already busy with work that would keep us occupied for the foreseeable future. The firm had also just been assigned dozens of files from one of our longtime clients, so it would be difficult for us to handle the work for the new client in any event. As a result of demand for our legal services, the partner decided it would be appropriate to charge the new client more than was typical at that shop.

Of course, the opposite is also true. Lawyers sometimes struggle to have a steady stream of work since many matters can resolve at once and business development efforts can be unfruitful over a given period. As a result, even the best lawyers might find themselves looking for work once in a while. One of the easiest ways to increase the likelihood of snagging additional client work is to lower prices. Many small and medium-sized clients want to protect their bottom lines from ballooning legal costs, and they are more likely to go with a lawyer they know they can trust who is also offering a reasonable rate.

One time, I was an associate at a Biglaw shop, and our team was facing a work shortage due to some major cases settling. The partners, seemingly looking for work that would keep us busy, accepted work with lower hourly rates than would typically be charged to clients. The Biglaw firm only assigned the most-junior associates to work on the file since the rates promised to the client were near the typical rates of junior associates, which created a bunch of problems with the files. However, the partners definitely incorporated the demand for our legal services into the prices they charged clients during that time.

There are other ways that lawyers sometimes fluctuate their prices in order to accomplish goals in their legal practices. For instance, if a lawyer thinks that a client might be difficult to handle, they might charge a higher rate. If the client walks away, no love is lost, but if the client agrees to pay the rate, this can accommodate some of the difficulties of working on the matter. In addition, if a lawyer hates to work on a particular type of matter, they might charge a higher rate to make up for the unpleasantness associated with the work. If the client walks away, at least the lawyer does not need to deal with the matter, but if the client agrees, then the increased pay can make up for any unpleasantness.

All told, pricing within the legal industry can be just as dynamic as prices for other goods and services. The demand for legal services in a given period can have a substantial impact on the legal fees charged by lawyers, and attorneys can use their rates to accomplish other goals in their practices.

# Elon Musk Takes Time Out From Failing To Buy Twitter To Fail To Build His Own Law Firm
## Another thing he builds that can go up in flames.

When Elon Musk first said he planned to buy Twitter I told people it wasn’t going to happen. Within the first 48 hours he was breaching the terms of the agreement by publicly criticizing the company and its general counsel. Now he’s blasting out proprietary information about bots. At every turn he’s trying to wiggle out of this deal that made little sense to begin with and became downright foolhardy when Tesla stock tanked and cryptocurrency fell off a cliff — two major prongs of Musk’s wealth.

Maybe he can ultimately pull this off, but at this point the deal seems destined for litigation.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And with that in mind, Musk seems interested in building out his own little in-house law firm. Which he’s setting up by posting on Twitter… of course.

Tesla is building a hardcore litigation department where we directly initiate & execute lawsuits. The team will report directly to me.

Please send 3 to 5 bullet points describing evidence of exceptional ability.

No better way to find exceptional legal talent than asking for 3 to 5 bullet points. Why is Musk building his own firm? Mostly because he’s sick and tired of outside counsel refusing to be bullied by a man-child.

So does this mean the sexual harassment allegations against him were completely true? Because [he seems to have settled those](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/05/elon-musk-flight-attendant-sexual-misconduct-allegations). That’s why you don’t go around saying stuff about refusing the settle unjust cases.

He calls out Perkins because it’s so deeply connected to the Democratic Party and Musk’s fanboys are all breathing in the [John Durham delusions](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/fake-attorney-general-opines-on-fake-michael-sussmann-case-questions-dc-jury-of-uh-you-know-which-uh/) about Perkins sitting at the center of an elaborate plot against Donald Trump. Cooley, on the other hand, famously sided with its associate after [Musk threatened to pull his business from the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-firm-chooses-associate-over-elon-musk/) because the new associate had investigated Tesla while working at the SEC.

Neither firm is particularly “white-shoe” but whatever.

“There will be blood.” How does anyone take this guy seriously?

# Law Firms Are Worried About Their Money, Ability To Close Deals Thanks To Historic Bank Failures
## Is it time for law firms to say goodbye to smaller, regional banks?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I think that any law firm has to be concerned about whether or not their wires are going to go through, and what happens to the escrow accounts — are they given ready access to escrow to complete transactions? We have an erosion of confidence in the banking system, in particular in smaller, regional banks. What we don’t need now is an erosion of confidence in commercial parties, in their law firms, in being able to close their transactions. That would be the worst thing.

I don’t think we’re done yet. I think this is round one, to stop the bleeding. There’s gonna be a round two, which maybe requires some longer-term operation.

— [Joseph Cioffi](https://www.dglaw.com/people/joseph-cioffi/), chair of the insolvency and finance practice at Davis+Gilbert, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/03/14/signature-banks-failure-prompts-alarm-bells-for-law-firms/) on how [Signature Bank’s failure](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/signature-bank-law-firms-go-to-bank-closed-by-regulators/), the third-largest bank failure in history, is affecting law firms, and what may happen in the future thanks to its regulatory shutdown, the second bank to face the same fate within a week.

# Simpson Thacher's Gift To Associates Goes Over Like A Lead Balloon
## The irony was just too much to bear.

What? This *isn’t* the recommended way to catch up on sleep??

It’s unusual for a *gift* to go over this badly. Most times when Biglaw firms hand out various pieces of branded swag, associates are pleased — or at worst, indifferent — with the token. But when the gift calls attention to the problems with working in a Biglaw shop, well, folks are going to get annoyed.

As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-simpson-thacher-hands-out-tone-deaf-sleeping-kits) Roll on Friday, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett celebrated World Sleep Day (a holiday you probably didn’t even know existed) by handing out sleep-themed gifts. But touting the benefits of good sleep hygiene at a workplace that is likely responsible for the *bad* sleep you’re getting can sure feel like a gut punch.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Sources said the gifts were misconceived and that handing out sleeping aids was “ironic” given that STB’s corporate teams in London “are regularly made to work until 3am”.

To really rub it in, the “tone deaf” pack also included a Simpson Thacher branded silk eye mask and a pillow spray containing speed essential oils “known for their relaxing properties”.

Rounding out the goodies was a book, Why We Sleep, which argues that slumber is the “most important” factor for physical and mental health.

Like lot of work/life balance issues, Biglaw firms[ have to tread carefully](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/biglaw-firm-makes-big-joke-out-of-worklife-balance/). Certainly recognizing the importance of sleep is a good thing for Simpson to do! But lavender scented STB-branded oils isn’t getting the job done — getting partners to cut back on the unnecessary fire drills, on the other hand…

# Biglaw Compensation Trends: Milbank Pioneers With Associate Salary Increase
## Explore Milbank's bold salary increase shaping Biglaw's 2024 landscape and its impact on legal careers.

In a landscape of cautious optimism within Biglaw, Milbank has announced an increase in first-year associate salaries to $225,000, setting a new benchmark in legal compensation. This move reflects a confident outlook for 2024, despite the previous year’s volatility in client demand and transactional work. The adjustment, which represents a $10,000 increment, establishes a precedent in a market that has witnessed only conservative financial growth in recent years.

The upward salary revision, effective from January 2024, spans across the firm’s hierarchy, reaching up to $425,000 for more tenured associates. This decision coincides with the announcement of year-end bonuses that echo the figures from the previous cycle, asserting Milbank’s commitment to maintaining competitive compensation in a changing economic climate.

These developments, indicative of Milbank’s resilience and foresight, may serve as a bellwether for the sector’s financial health and the strategic positioning of legal talent. As firms navigate this evolving terrain, the need for astute career management and market readiness becomes increasingly apparent.

# 3 Tips For Home Productivity
## The default for productive IP lawyers remains centered on performance in the office environment.

To those who have had enough of hearing about the COVID-19 lockdown, please know that I am quickly falling into the same camp. At the same time, we have to accept reality. For many IP lawyers — we who are decidedly “nonessential,” unlike those heroes tending to the sick and working to keep the healthy supplied and fed — the need to work from home constitutes a major change. True, many of us have gotten better at using technology to work remotely, even on that (now long-forgotten) occasional event called a vacation, in recognition of the always on-call nature of modern legal practice. But even with the relaxing of face-time standards at many law firms, the default for productive IP lawyers remains centered on performance in the office environment. Since our responsibilities to clients, colleagues, and our families are unceasing, there is a communal challenge facing the IP legal community we now must confront. How to stay as productive as possible when working from home, in an environment where both the general economy and legal system — indeed our very lives — have been severely disrupted.

As I mentioned in last week’s column, I may have more practical experience than most in terms of working remotely — for a number of reasons. Part of the impetus for the need to stay productive at home from the earliest stages of my career arose because of my personal observance of the Sabbath and the Jewish holidays, which obviously had an impact on when the office was accessible to me. Another large piece was the fact that my children were born concurrent with my Biglaw career. My desire to be with them of course led to my putting a premium on productivity in the times I wasn’t with them. Hence the late night brief-drafting, on top of the other accommodations inherent in the life of a partner-track Biglaw IP associate. With all that, however, during my time in Biglaw I was definitely in the majority of IP lawyers who had an “office-first” mentality in terms of thinking about the physical divide between work and family life.

This microscopic virus has completely collapsed the divide for many of us worldwide. Since I have been getting much more practice at working from home over the past few years, I want to share three idiosyncratic tips about achieving optimal productivity that I hope can be of help to readers.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
First, let’s start with what not to do. Simply put, that means not adopting an extreme position on anything productivity-wise — without adopting an experimental mindset first. Just as deciding that you can necessarily work any less mindfully because you are now free from the distractions of the office is not conducive to remaining productive, so too is it important to avoid the temptation to turn as much of your newfound “free time” (e.g. former commuting time) into work time as possible. In short, now is not the time to show your employer or our colleagues what a superhero you are. It is a time for modesty, not aggrandizement.

At the least, for many the distractions of the office will now be replaced by the distractions of the home — sometimes severe ones that make our current experience very far away from a previously routine work-from-home Friday. Even for someone who lives alone, since the people they will be interacting as might not be. Cue up memes of underwear-clad toddlers (or even adults) wandering in the background of Zoom meetings if you don’t believe. So don’t pretend things are normal — you will be more productive by adopting that experimental mindset about this bizarre experience. At the same time, establishing some sort of routine is very important. I know that some tout the importance of getting dressed for the workday, but I am not sure how much of a difference that makes. In my view, it is better to find a reason to leave the house every day, if only to remind you of the broader world out there and the lessons you can draw from watching other humans from a safe six-foot (or 26-foot) distance. At a minimum, I would hope that leaving the house would be preceded by dressing in some kind of presentable attire.

Second, in addition to getting some air, it is also important to carve out at least a half-hour a day doing something work-related that you enjoy. Whether that means reading a decision in a case of interest, or watching an appellate argument, or just looking for an interesting article online related to an IP issue doesn’t matter. What matters is giving your mind the space to roam a bit, without the pressure associated with a work deliverable. We become better lawyers and people the more we indulge our curiosity, so take advantage of the work-from-home time to build such productive curiosity-seeking into your schedule.

Third, make sure you know going into each day what needs to get done on behalf of your clients. Ideally, the list of must-dos will be manageable, even as every day brings a set of one or two things that should really get done that day, without procrastination. While this may be harder to do if you are at the stage of your career where work gets dumped on you, there really should be fewer emergencies now that everything’s on lockdown. Either way, learning how to triage assignments into must-do, should-do, or can-do is always useful. More than ever now.

Ultimately, the most important thing for us to remember is that we can continue to serve our clients and practice our noble profession no matter where we are. Done right, we can be as productive as we want — no, need — to be in these trying times. We owe it to our clients, families, and colleagues to make the most of this situation.  More critically, we owe it to ourselves.

## Exciting news for associates.

There’s nothing that’ll start your day off on the right foot quite like a big bonus announcement from your firm. That’s exactly what happened this morning at Debevoise & Plimpton, a firm that’s ranked at No. 34 on the latest Am Law 100, having brought home $1,329,262,000 gross revenue last year.

The firm is of course matching the prevailing market rate on bonuses this year. [Peter Furci](https://www.debevoise.com/peterfurci), the firm’s presiding partner, had this kind message to share with associates in Debevoise’s bonus memo:

This has been another year of extraordinary challenges. Once again, you have performed at levels of the highest excellence of client service, maintained our cultural values, supported each other and served the broader community with many hours of pro bono.

Here’s the bonus scale, in case you’ve forgotten what it looks like:

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015+: $115,000
Congratulations to everyone at Debevoise!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Debevoise.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

What Biglaw had the most in gross revenue in 2017, according to data collected as part of the Am Law 100?

Hint: There’s a new number 1 (in gross revenue) this year, after Latham & Watkins (which held the #1 spot for three years) slipped to number 2.

# How Can Comedy Help Biglaw With Issues Related To Gender, Diversity, And Inclusion?

It’s no secret that America’s largest law firms are lacking in diversity. Studies have shown that minorities make up fewer than 7 percent of law firm partners, and men are two to five times more likely to make partner than women. In fact, less than 10 percent of top Biglaw rainmakers are women or minorities. These problems are no laughing matter, but in some cases, comedic intervention can be a useful way to solve them.

I recently had the opportunity to attend a series of workshops put together by [Second City Works](http://www.secondcity.com/works/), the B2B side of [The Second City](http://www.secondcity.com/), the world-renowned improvisation school and comedy theatre, which had to do with diversity, inclusion, and gender equality in the workplace. This “Creating a Culture of Inclusion” event was held at Caroline’s on Broadway and focused on identifying gender gaps and challenges within organizations while facilitating skill-building techniques and tools to empower more diverse leadership within corporate America. It was so much fun, and such a great learning experience.

I spoke to [Brynne Humphreys](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brynne-humphreys-2b532469), the VP of Client Services for Second City Works, about these workshops, and how they could be used in a law firm setting.

SZ: Congratulations on your work with Second City Works’ diversity, inclusion, and gender workshop programming. Having participated in the programs, I have to say that they were inspiring. Can you share with our readers what these workshops are about?

BH: These workshops are part of Second City Works’ overall diversity and inclusion (D&I) package, focused on building the skills necessary to practice inclusion and support in the workplace. Currently, we offer each of these workshops as stand alone sessions, or as part of our broader offering that also includes relevant videos.

For our D&I workshop, “Culture of Inclusion,” we focus on leadership-level skills and behaviors that give participants the tools needed in managing an inclusive team. We use techniques like Being Others’ Focused, Got Your Back, Looking Through Labels, and more. Ideas like: How does language choice affect inclusion? What do you do if you make a mistake? How can your cell phone or computer indicate to someone if you’re invested in them?

For our women in leadership workshop, “2095 Today,” we focus on leadership communication techniques (regardless of gender), Modeling Behavior + Mentorship, Taking & Supporting Risk, and more. Ideas like: Can you say Yes to get to No? Are the “rules” real, or are you making some of them up for yourself? What does it look like when someone really has your back?

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
SZ: In case you’re unaware, law is the least diverse profession in the nation, and law firms are constantly under fire for not doing enough to change that. How could a Second City Works workshop on these issues help?

We really believe every business in every industry should take steps to ensure that their workforce represents their client base. That is just good humanity, not to mention good business.

For those industries that have a lot of ground to make up (like law), we believe action can be taken on several levels. Often we find that there are uncertainties or inconsistencies in what “diverse” means to all people. Our workshops and videos can go a long way towards getting everyone on the same page and really starting a conversation about what a diverse organization looks like. Finding a way to level set that conversation goes a long way towards aligning on a solution.

Our workshops in particular can be a necessary part of the inclusion part of D&I — making sure that once the composition of the workforce begins to change, that the attitudes, behaviors, and mindsets evolve as well, and make room for new voices and ideas.

SZ: Women in law firms are battling gender bias on a seemingly every day basis. How would Second City Works’ full-day workshop on women in leadership shape the conversation on gender equity in the law?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
BH: Well, to start, we ask that men be a part of our sessions whenever possible. Part of the challenge with the current conversation is that it is viewed as a “women’s conversation” — one that is by women, for women, and focused on women building skills so they can compete better with men.

We see this as an organizational issue, not a women’s issue. Organizations need to take control of this conversation and enable women and men to be part of the solution. Our 2095 Today sessions build leadership and ensemble (team) skills, regardless of gender.

We focus on curriculum that we know is relevant to accelerating female success in the workplace: mentorship and sponsorship, risk taking and supporting risk, and communicating with intention.

SZ: Tell our readers more about Second City Works’ 2095 Today program, and how you think it could work in a law firm setting.

Our 2095 Today program is ideal for a law firm setting, regardless of size. We work with leadership/partners to establish goals that make sense for the organization (goals like number of women in leadership positions, number of female interviews for entry-level positions, etc.) and use our content and skill-building to drive a series of workshops with segmented teams. The outcome of these workshops is an action plan that breaks down the goals into incremental steps and assigns accountability to different teams.

We continue to work with the organization through webinars, and track progress against the action plan for the next 12 – 18 months.

By breaking the gender parity challenge into bite-sized pieces, and by skill-building alongside the workforce as we develop a road map, we set the stage for incremental success that ultimately can have an overarching impact.

SZ: Congratulations again to Second City Works for its educational, inspiring, and much-needed programming on diversity, inclusion, and gender equality in the workplace. Thanks for inviting me to take part!

If you think your law firm could benefit from workshops like these (sessions which likely qualify for CLE credit), please [get in touch](http://www.secondcity.com/works/what-we-do/legal-compliance/article/continuous-learning-for-legal-professionals/) with Second City Works as soon as possible.

We’ve talked a bit about how to spend your new salary — assuming you don’t work for Jones Day or some other firm trying to buck the trend. Last week we encouraged you to [give to charity](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/spend-your-pay-raise-to-support-a-good-cause/). Now that we’ve gotten the socially responsible stuff out of the way, let’s just blow this on you.

Here’s a nice little accessory for home or office: a [floating portable speaker](http://amzn.to/28JjOF8) by Crazybaby (affiliate link). It’s a speaker that has a gravity-defying floaty thing!

— [Farmida Bi](https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en/people/100141), global chair and chair of Europe, Middle East and Asia at Norton Rose Fulbright, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/12/as-currencies-fluctuate-law-firms-adjust-lawyer-pay-and-billing-across-the-globe-405-114437/), on how the firm is navigating the ever-fluctuating value of local currency in the UK. Bi went on to say that with its large presence in London, Norton Rose has been actively recruiting there for quite some time, and it has nothing to do with sterling’s current value.

# Business Partnering Is A Verb, Not A Noun
## Executive level leaders want active participation in the problem-solving process.

When I landed my first in-house position over 12 years ago, I believed that my role was limited to providing legal advice to my client. When presented with a legal question, I believed that it was my job to provide possible options and to provide an explanation as to what risks were associated with each option. If asked which option I would recommend, I would routinely respond by simply stating that it was a management decision and that it was beyond my purview.

As time went by, however, it became increasingly clear to me that my response was no longer acceptable. The executive level leaders with whom I worked wanted more. They wanted me to actively participate in the problem-solving process. They expected me to weigh in and make recommendations based on my understanding of the problem and the potential risk. Coming to that realization was transformative for me, and it impacted how I interacted with executive level leaders moving forward. I began shifting from more than just a legal advisor. I began to become more of a strategic business partner.

Recently, I came across a book called “A New Vision for Corporate Lawyers” written by Peter Connor, founder and CEO of Alternatively Legal Pty Ltd. Reading his book left me wondering if I needed to rethink my approach to being a strategic business partner. In his book, Conner points out that “[m]ost lawyers, and most commentators, refer to business partnering as ‘understanding the business and developing strong working relationships with … business clients.” However, as Connor also points out, “[b]usiness partnering is something you do, not something you are.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[I]t is much more than:

- being business minded or having business acumen
- understanding the business, or
- being a business partner (the noun).
You can be a business partner, as many in-house lawyers are, but not engage in business partnering at all. To put it another way, if you are business partner it means you probably have a “seat at the table” but business partnering focuses on what you do when you are at “the table.”

This is an expression sometimes used to describe a situation where you are considered part of the business team on an informal if not a formal basis.

Being a business partner is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to engage in business partnering.

When you are engaging in business partnering, you are “[h]elping your clients to solve/prevent business problems and to create/implement business opportunities by providing business advice or input.” Examples of business input or advice that Connor provide in his book include:

- decision support
- clarifying business objectives
- commenting on business discussions in meetings or by email
- raising potential business issues with proposals
- suggesting alternative ways to achieve better business outcomes
- pointing out nonlegal risks, especially reputational ones
- identifying business opportunities
- anticipating business problems
- referring to other analogous situations
- connecting colleagues with other colleagues who have relevant input
- highlighting personnel, resource, or process problems
- recommending courses of action
The “business input or advice may be, and typically is, provided in conjunction with legal advice. In fact, it may be difficult to separate the two. However, if you have business input to offer, you can and should do so even if there is no legal issue involved.”

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
After I read his book, Peter and I connected for an extended conversation about it. When asked why in-house legal teams should consider reading his book and adopting a new approach, Peter responded in this way:

“[U]nlike most other books, it has the potential to be game changing at a time when ‘the game’ really is changing big time! Anyone reading your column probably doesn’t need to be convinced that the game is changing, especially since everyone can now see how generative AI will increasingly encroach on traditional legal work.

Most people would say that, in a world of dramatic technology change, the key to change the game is to focus on digital transformation. However, that overlooks one fundamental and crucial question. How should lawyers change themselves and the work that they do? I call it human transformation and it is as important, if not more so, to find a way to change the game for people, not just systems and processes.

For individual lawyers, my book is game changing because it:

- shows you what other work you could be doing if work that you currently do is outsourced and/or impacted by generative artificial intelligence
- results in your work having more of an impact and, as a result, being more valued
- will completely change your approach to professional development and learning
- offers the prospect of addressing your professional frustrations and aspirations
- helps you become more adaptable and prepared for the future
For legal departments and legal service providers it is game changing because it changes your mission, strategies, products, and services offered, who you hire and how you develop them, what technology you deploy and how you deploy it and even your culture. In short it changes everything.

The new vision I propose applies to all stakeholders and, if adopted, can move the needle for the corporate legal industry as a whole in a totally new direction.  In fact, if you read my book and, afterwards, continue to work and develop yourself as usual, then I have failed to properly explain this new direction in the book.”

If you are as intrigued as I am about this idea, you should [consider downloading a free copy](https://peterconnor.legalbusinesslibrary.com/) of Peter Connor’s book.

UPDATE (12/7/16 1:28 p.m.): Maybe this visit was a bit premature… read on.

Tiffany Trump, the Trump daughter that Donald has never taken [terrifying Lolita pictures with](https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/donald-ivanka-trump-throwback-photo-lead-11.jpg?w=600), has made no secret of her legal-industry ambitions. Over the summer, while the rest of her half-siblings stumped for her father and [made racist pricks of themselves](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-faces-backlash-after-comparing-syrian-refugees-to-skittles-that-can-kill.html?_r=0), Tiffany hunkered down with her LSAT prep books. Over the summer, she informed the world via emoji that she “[got this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJoP153AgfQ/),” and if her visit to Harvard Law School is any indication… she did indeed get that. UPDATE: Or maybe not quite yet… while I assumed she took the test in September and has her results back, a tipster claims she took it on Saturday at CUNY in Long Island City. So she must be feeling pretty confident.

This is our real-life Legally Blonde, people! Except let’s go ahead and assume that Warner is the President-elect.

Eagle-eyed observers at Harvard inform us that the future First Daughter toured HLS yesterday with a Secret Service detail in tow. Oh, who are we kidding? She knows she’s not the “First” Daughter and she seems pretty OK with that:



Anyway, where were we? Right. The picture. It’s not a great shot, but you can’t blame students for wanting to keep their distance and play it cool when a prospective student brings a bunch of armed guards to the building:

And for those who will scoff and act like this is just Harvard extending a courtesy to the rich and powerful regardless of merit — you know, the affirmative action white people don’t complain about — don’t write off Tiffany’s academic chops. The 22-year-old daughter of Marla Maples followed a Trump tradition in attending Penn, but ditched finance and economics to major in sociology and urban studies, which instantly makes her more qualified to head up HUD than Ben Carson. Alas, the [Bobby Kennedy law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/3110) has robbed us of the most fashionable HUD Secretary since Jack Kemp and sent Tiffany back to the law school circuit. [Ed. Note: Some people have backchanneled me acting as if I’m suggesting that majoring in sociology and urban studies is a “bad” thing because it’s not finance and economics. Balderdash. Sociology and urban studies reflects a superior intellectual curiosity to the remedial B-school majors.]

Where else is Tiffany looking? If she stops by your law school, be sure to let us know.

In the meantime, congratulations to Tiffany Trump on her apparent LSAT success and her future legal career. Perhaps it’s time for the Trump clan to move a little closer to the legacy of Tiffany’s aunt, Judge [Maryanne Trump Barry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryanne_Trump_Barry), and a little farther from, well, whatever clan you’d associate with Steve Bannon.

# Gibson Dunn Names 13 New Partners; How Diverse Is This Group?
## They're diverse in terms of offices and practice areas, but not in terms of gender and race.

Okay, it’s not quite this extreme….

There’s no denying that [Gibson Dunn & Crutcher](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/gibson-dunn/) is one the nation’s greatest law firms. It offers a compelling combination of prestige, profitability, and public-spiritedness. Its lawyers undertake noble pro bono work, everything from fighting for marriage equality (Ted Olson) to [representing grieving families](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/the-abc-news-2020-segment-on-the-dan-markel-murder-case/) (Orin Snyder) to [defending victims of Donald Trump’s litigiousness](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-partner-will-represent-those-sued-by-donald-trump-for-free/) (Ted Boutrous). It comes as no surprise to me to see the firm near the top of the American Lawyer’s [A-List](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/what-firms-are-atop-the-a-list-2016/), which ranks firms based on financial success, pro bono commitment, associate satisfaction, and diversity.

Ah, diversity. That was the one A-List category where Gibson didn’t score in the 190s (out of 200). And it seems that it’s still an issue at the firm, as one GDC source pointed out to us:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Gibson Dunn just announced the new partner class: 10 men (all white, in LA, DC, NY, and London) and 3 women firm-wide (2 in NY and 1 in Paris). Probably not that surprising in Biglaw, but still pretty depressing to me as a young female associate.

I feel like in 2005/2006 the incoming class must have been pretty evenly split between men and women. It’s pretty disheartening.

You can flip to the next page to see the [13 new partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/gibson-dunn-names-13-new-partners-how-diverse-is-this-group/2/). They exhibit impressive geographic diversity, representing five different offices, and practice-group diversity, representing about a half-dozen different specializations (depending on how you count the litigators). But it’s true that, as noted by our source, they aren’t the most diverse group under the sun. Less than a quarter are women (although it should be noted that two of the women partners are diverse).

What does the firm have to say about these selections? Chairman and managing partner [Ken Doran](http://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyers/kdoran) issued this statement:

We are very proud of our new class of partners; each of them exemplifies the characteristics that we expect of our partners – excellence, integrity, professionalism and collegiality. We are particularly thrilled to welcome Anita Girdhari, Saee Muzumdar and Judith Raoul-Bardy to our partnership ranks. They will be terrific partners. We are actively focused on improving diversity and inclusiveness within the Firm and, while we have made significant progress in recent years, we acknowledge that this priority will require a sustained effort. We are confident that our steadfast commitment and consistent focus on this priority at all levels of the Firm will prove successful.

It’s certainly the case that GDC is focusing on diversity — see, e.g., its [response](http://www.vault.com/media/3873177/392.pdf) to the Vault/MCCA diversity survey — and hopefully these efforts will bear fruit in the years ahead.

In fairness to Gibson Dunn, one shouldn’t judge an entire firm by the diversity of a single partnership class (a point we made when discussing [Sullivan & Cromwell’s new partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/sullivan-cromwells-new-partners-impressive-yes-diverse-not-so-much/)). GDC has a fair number of women and minorities in its partnership, including some of its most prominent partners (such as former U.S. Attorney [Debra Wong Yang](http://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyers/dwongyang) — but note she might be leaving to [lead the SEC](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/morning-docket-12-07-16/) during the Trump Administration). And because the vast majority (more than 85 percent) of Gibson Dunn partners are equity rather than non-equity partners, these diverse partners are “true” partners.

Even though one shouldn’t read too much into the diversity (or lack thereof) in a single group of new partners, it’s important for firms to know that these subjects don’t go unnoticed. Diversity and inclusion matter — to a firm’s current lawyers, to potential recruits, and perhaps most importantly, to [clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/gcs-back-new-initiative-to-bring-diversity-to-the-legal-profession-will-it-make-an-impact/).

# Jones Day Is Divided Between 'MAGA Jones Day' And 'Lawyers Who Enable MAGA Jones Day'

Around legal journalism it’s almost cliché to note that Jones Day is the lawyerly face of the Trump movement. We’ve covered the firm’s rightward drift for years and, relatively recently, the rest of America [started hearing a bit about it too](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/). But most of the country is still unaware about this Cleveland law firm that transformed into an international conservative grievance engine.

David Enrich, author of the upcoming book [Servants of the Damned](https://amzn.to/3wDPzZc) (affiliate link), [wrote a piece in this weekend’s New York Times Magazine](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/magazine/jones-day-trump.html) about the role Jones Day played — and continues to play — in the Trumpist movement. There are a lot of wild details about how the Jones Day network turned the federal government into its personal playground, but what really shines through is how the firm’s right-wing hobby horse project is both one of the smallest and yet most important parts of the firm.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Enrich lays out the story of a corporate law firm that took its big bucks from representing [Big Tobacco](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/edu.ucsf.industrydocuments.artifacts/m/y/c/y/mycy0102/mycy0102.pdf#page=6) and [Savings and Loan charlatans](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/20/business/law-firm-settles-s-l-case.html) and decided to build an internal second firm devoted to reactionary causes. As Enrich explains, the ball really got rolling when Stephen Brogan took over as managing partner in 2003.

Brogan brought on a series of high-profile devotees of the Federalist Society — including leading Reagan and Bush administration lawyers like Michael Carvin and Noel Francisco — to work in the firm’s issues-and-appeals practice, which became a sort of in-house conservative think tank. Even as most of the firm’s lawyers remained focused on bread-and-butter work for big companies, Jones Day took on a growing list of ideologically charged cases and causes, including efforts by the ultraconservative Buckeye Institute to [prevent the expansion](https://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/research/detail/buckeye-institute-secures-win-in-legal-battle-over-early-voting) of early voting in Ohio and [challenge the legitimacy](https://www.jonesday.com/en/practices/experience/2018/10/buckeye-institute-submits-brief-in-support-of-cert) of the Obama administration’s newly inaugurated Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

On one hand, congratulations on spotting a new market. On the other hand, this work is clearly a drop in the bucket for a global law firm — it’s really just an opportunity to divert firm largess toward eroding constitutional order for funsies! Most firms have a nice charity they build pro bono work around, Jones Day has [throwing out Pennsylvania ballots](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/02/22/at-supreme-court-jones-day-loses-bid-challenging-pennsylvania-mail-in-ballots/). Potato, po-tah-to.

But this side project representing Republicans became more gravely serious when it morphed into creating the right-wing’s legal farm team ready to step in and yank the levers of power toward their own ends when Trump got into office. And, of course, [populating the federal judiciary with its non-qualified associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/shocking-no-one-aba-thinks-biglaw-associate-not-ready-for-federal-bench/)!

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Former Jones Day partner Mark Herrmann defended the firm [in his Above the Law column today](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/a-short-defense-of-jones-day/):

I have this to say about all of that: Jones Day has about 2,500 lawyers. How many of those 2,500 worked on Trump stuff? 20? 30? 50? I can’t believe it was more than that; 50 lawyers staffs up an awful lot of big projects.

So what’s the average schlub partner in the Cleveland, or Los Angeles, or London office of Jones Day thinking about while those 50-ish lawyers are off doing their Trump things? “That Trump stuff might be a little offensive to me, but I’ve got other things to worry about — like tending to big corporate litigation or mergers and acquisitions.”

True, if irrelevant. There are a ton of Jones Day lawyers out there doing entirely benign work. And their financial and reputational contributions are funneled into [voter suppression](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/oh-to-be-a-fly-on-the-wall-at-jones-day-as-dissension-at-the-firm-grows/) and [helping companies deny healthcare to women](https://rollcall.com/2013/01/24/unlikely-coalition-fights-contraception-mandate/). It’s like one of those multi-level marketing cults where novice acolytes pump in money blissfully ignorant of what the “Operational Tauntaun Level 7s” do with all that cash. If you want to keep your head down and say “I just represent harmless [opioid producers](https://www.jonesday.com/en/practices/experience/2017/09/purdue-pharma-asserts-patent-infringement-claims-u)” that’s your right, but that doesn’t make it true — you’re a cog in a machine built to enable the legal arm of MAGA.

Herrmann continues:

Moreover, be honest: Most of you would have an extraordinarily hard time turning down a high-ranking government job, even if the job were offered by an administration of which you were skeptical.

To be clear, if the Trump administration asked me to be Solicitor General, I’d have certainly taken the position if only for the LOLZ. The point is the Trump administration wasn’t going to ask me to be Solicitor General. Enrich isn’t criticizing individual Jones Day alums for choosing to join the Trump administration, his argument is that Jones Day deliberately positioned itself to be Donald Trump’s first call when looking for nominees. It may only be “50-ish lawyers,” but shrugging that off is akin to shrugging off a string of police shootings as “a couple of bad apples.”

But bad apples spoil bunches. Some of the most highly recruited attorneys in the Jones Day arsenal — with more liberal views than the firm’s most famous voices — [complained about the firm’s increasingly toxic brand](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/oh-to-be-a-fly-on-the-wall-at-jones-day-as-dissension-at-the-firm-grows/). Enrich reports that those folks have left. And the concerns have spread to some close to leadership:

Even some of Brogan’s allies told me they worried that the firm was approaching a point at which this would become a problem for clients. Big companies, after all, had been increasingly vocal about their opposition to Trump’s extreme policies and rhetoric. Brogan’s advisers suggested that he pull back. He forged ahead.

And that’s the real nut of it. As long as Jones Day brands itself as MAGA’s chief counsel, those non-partisan books of business are going to suffer. At some point rainmakers outside of the firm’s political arm — even if they’re also relatively conservative — are going to bolt just to avoid the headache.

And they should do it earlier than later because this issue isn’t going away.

# Magic Circle Firm Matches Cravath Scale
## The British invasion of salary increases begins.

‘Ello, what’s all this then? Appears as though a U.K. firm is getting in on the salary bump mayhem for its U.S.-based associates to make sure they are no longer undercompensated relative to the market. If in the 1940s Americans were “oversexed, overpaid and over here,” well now the U.S. Freshfields associates are… well, probably none of the three.

It was only a matter of time, any foreign firm trying to build a competitive practice can’t afford to find itself behind the times. Relatedly, we’ve not yet heard from Allen & Overy, Linklaters, or Clifford Chance. One suspects this announcement lights a fire under them.

Associates at Freshfields were treated to the [happy memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/magic-circle-firm-matches-cravath-scale/2/) from regional managing parter [Adam Siegel](http://www.freshfields.com/profiles/Adam_Siegel/) that adopts the Cravath scale up through the class of ’07 and up earning $325K (not the $315K for ’08 and senior where some firms top out). The firm also raised summer associate salaries accordingly, one more reason why Freshfields [boasts a fun summer program](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/is-your-firm-on-the-most-fun-summer-programs-list-2015/).

So put away those crates of tea, Freshfields Yanks, you’re getting your due.

Full memo available [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/uk-firm-matches-cravath-scale/2/).

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Mischief Makers
## Perhaps being a judge doesn't have quite the cachet it used to.

It never ceases to amaze me how people can be so careless of what they have worked their whole career for: that is, the transition from being a lawyer to being a judge. Perhaps being a judge doesn’t have quite the cachet it used to (given all the TV judges, whether they are real-life judges, have ever been so, or never were), but the seeming indifference to what the robe conveys astounds me.

One recent example is up in the far reaches of Northern California. The California Commission on Judicial Performance (CCJP) has filed a notice of [formal proceedings against Gregory Kreis](https://cjp.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2024/02/Kreis_NFP_02-02-24.pdf), a Humboldt County Superior Court judge. (Humboldt County is roughly 300 miles north of San Francisco.) Judge Kreis is charged with “willful misconduct in office, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute.” The notice alleges 19 separate charges of judicial misconduct.

The panoply of charges range from stupid, offensive behavior at a social gathering to much more serious offenses while presiding over various matters. Alleged misconduct includes having an affair with the court’s family law facilitator (at the time, Kreis was assigned to family law court), suggesting that he would report an attorney to the California State Bar for filing a motion to disqualify him, a failure to recuse himself in certain specified cases, a failure to disclose the existence of certain friendships between the judge and counsel in various cases, using cocaine, making inappropriate comments in court … the list goes on.

Kreis faced a primary challenge two days ago and lost to April Van Dyke, a contract defense attorney who won 60% of the vote. Meanwhile, the judge has denied the allegations of drug use, ethics violation, and sexual harassment in his [formal response to the CCJP](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2024/feb/23/judge-kreis-files-response-misconduct-allegations/).

The CCJP’s notice in the Kreis case makes interesting reading and provides a cautionary tale for all of us. Antics on the bench can cost you your seat.

Lawyers can create mischief that gets them fired. Even if you think that the judicial officer is not worth the robe she is wearing, it is drummed into us from our very first day in law school that judges are to be treated with respect, no matter what under-the-breath mutterings are made. Ben Aderholt obviously didn’t get the lesson, as [he took a judge to task](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/calling-out-a-judge-using-your-firms-letterhead-doesnt-really-help-out-its-reputation/), with the first insult in a letter to her being the use of her first name. The conduct proceeded downhill from there. “Who do you think you are?” may be an appropriate game show question, but asking the judge that question is bound to get the lawyer in trouble, and it did. How do you spell fired? What made it even worse was that the letter was written on the firm’s letterhead. Whoops. How do you explain that faux pas to future interviewing partners and corporate counsel?

Remember when we were just starting to practice and we heard the term “incorporation by reference,” which was a handy dandy way to avoid having to recite whatever  document or pleading needed to be included, but was too lengthy? So, we incorporated by reference. Mark Perry, a[ Biglaw lawyer, got benchslapped](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/court-scolds-weil-lawyer-for-brief-that-incorporated-by-reference-nearly-2000-words-from-another-document?utm_source=sfmc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weekly_email&promo=&utm_id=803922&sfmc_id=83087486) for doing exactly that. He tried to circumvent the page limitation by incorporating by reference 2,000 words from another document. Too clever by half? The Federal Circuit thought so.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Don’t try this in your case.

And another cautionary tale: if your opposing counsel is your former employer who terminated you for “work-related issues,” whatever you do, don’t treat that former employer (aka now opposing counsel) like a jerk, that is, if you value your law license.

Brian Manookian’s harassment included intimidating, demeaning, embarrassing, and harassing communications to opposing counsel and others. As one example, when Manookian and his partner learned that opposing counsel in a case had died, that same day Manookian filed a motion for default judgment. Nice, huh? The harassment targeted family members of opposing counsel and prompted fears for their safety, and it did not cease, even when there was new opposing counsel.

In disciplinary proceedings, a Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility hearing panel found that the purpose of the communications was to [intimidate opposing counsel](https://tncourts.gov/sites/default/files/OpinionsPDFVersion/Majority%20Opinion%20-%20M2022-00075-SC-R3-BP.pdf) in order to gain an unfair advantage in pending litigation. The Tennessee Supreme Court in its almost 80-page opinion was so appalled by Manookian’s behavior that it decided that only disbarment would be the proper remedy. “Victimizing the families of opposing counsel and causing concern for their well-being and safety is an especially grave offense and a profound dishonor as a lawyer.”

By the way, has anyone else noticed that there are more incidents about male judges and male lawyers misbehaving than of women judges and lawyers? Just asking.

Biglaw firm after Biglaw firm after Biglaw firm has been raising salaries to match the new market scale started by Davis Polk just last week. There’s a reason why these firms are so eager to increase their wages: the lateral market is insane right now, and keeping up with cash compensation is the number one way to retain and recruit associates. But it’s not just firms at the tippy top of the rankings that are upping their pay.

Yesterday afternoon, Kramer Levin — a firm ranked at No. 98 in the most recent Am Law 100, with $390,000,000 gross revenue in 2020 — announced that it would be meeting the new market standard. Co-managing partners Paul Schoeman and Howard Spilko had this to say about the firm’s money moves:

“Retaining and recruiting top talent is paramount to our ability to provide the highest levels of legal services to our clients. The salary increases recognize the valuable contributions of our associates and special counsel to the firm and our clients.”

Here’s what salaries will look like at the firm’s New York and Silicon Valley offices:

- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013: $365,000
- 2012: $375,000
Kramer Levin is one of the few firms that’s offering a salary bump up to $375K for ninth-year associates. We love to see it. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Kramer Levin.)

# How Much Should Associates Gift Support Staff?
## What *is* the industry standard?

Gift giving is one of those inexorable stressors of the holiday season. Whether you’re trying to figure out what to get your mom this year, how much to tip your door person, or what to give your child care worker — finding the perfect way to express your appreciation for the people that make your life easier takes a lot of thought.

It’s generally a tradition for lawyers at Biglaw firms to give gifts — usually cash — to the support staff that make their job smoother. And how much you should give to that essential paralegal is not always clear. Our network of tipsters has reported a wide spectrum of support staff gifts, from a measly $20 on the cheap end to an impressive $1,000 on the generous side. Previous iterations of Above the Law polling — assuming you’re a midlevel associate (and that amounts would scale up slightly as a senior or down as someone pretty junior), revealed [$300+ was the most popular answer.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/how-much-are-you-gifting-your-paralegal-admin-support-staff-this-holiday/?rf=1) But with the strange nature of the legal industry in 2022 — [layoffs and bonuses in the same day!](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/layoffs-and-bonuses-its-been-a-helluva-day-see-also/) — we wanted to check in and see if that’s still the industry standard.

We also know there are a variety of norms at different firms.

[](https://info.abovethelaw.com/embracing-cloud-technology)More than ever, law firms are looking at new ways of getting work done, with one industry analyst predicting that $1 trillion will be spent on cloud computing over the coming decade. But how and why should law firms [consider cloud technology](https://info.abovethelaw.com/embracing-cloud-technology)?

Cloud technology enables firms to be more flexible not only for their clients, but their staff as a means to accelerate workflows through customized workspaces based on the matters being worked on.

For many firms, determining how to continue to manage their practice with remote workers, as well as think ahead to how their legal practice and business model will undoubtedly change, is a massive undertaking.

– How do you work with anyone from anywhere?
– How can our firm manage custom apps?
– Where does the cloud investment end up?
– How do we look ahead through the clouds?

Now that the MoneyLaw phenomenon has taken root in all manner of [far flung U.S. cities](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/?rf=1) from Charlotte to Austin to Denver, there has been a lot of talk of moving. Lots of associate would — at least in theory — like to get some of that sweet, sweet money with none of the New York City costs of living.

With this big talk in mind, Law.com has compiled a list of the best places to live and work in Biglaw (or at least Bigish Law):

Here’s how: We took The National Law Journal’s NLJ 500 law firm branch offices info and paired it with U.S. News & World Report’s The Best Places to Live. U.S. News’ ranking was based on a strong job market and a high quality of life, among other factors. The ranking by the NLJ, a Law.com affiliate, is based on the number of full-time equivalent lawyers in each office.

# 72 Attorneys Have Left This Biglaw Firm In 2018, But Leadership Insists They Aren't Worried
## The firm is making some changes, but will it be enough?

Twenty-three partners, 31 associates and 18 of counsel have left Holland & Hart since the beginning of 2018. That’s [according](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/11/02/following-departures-holland-hart-looks-to-the-future/) to Law.com, but managing partner [Thomas O’Donnell](https://www.hollandhart.com/todonnell) doesn’t seem worried:

“We are in a profession that has not historically been known for our ability to adapt and change,” O’Donnell said. “And we are in a marketplace that is evolving and changing rapidly, and I think we pride ourselves for being in the category of law firms that are working hard on changing and adapting.”

The market for lateral partners is as hot as it’s ever been, and we’re on pace for 2,000 moves in 2018. And firms with comparatively low profits per partner (Holland & Hart rank 191st in the list of the Am Law 200 by this metric) are at a disadvantage. And H&H has been feeling the pinch:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This year, two notable groups departed Holland & Hart’s Salt Lake office for Dorsey & Whitney, the latter of which named a new leader last month. The first, a team of 10 intellectual property partners, departed in February and included brothers Grant and Brett Foster, Mark Miller and Bryan Pratt. In September, a seven-lawyer corporate transactions team, including partners Matthew Wells, Aaron Murdock, James Kelly, Craig Frame and Jeffrey Bowman, made the jump. Wells is one of three Band 1 M&A partners in Utah ranked by Chambers and Partners.

Polsinelli, a firm whose namesake announced his retirement this week, also picked up three former Holland & Hart partners in Colorado earlier this year in Scott Berdan, Chuck Cotter and Elizabeth Harding. In Las Vegas, litigator and former local managing partner Patrick Reilly joined Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck in late September.

But O’Donnell insists, that at least at the partnership level, everything is normal, if a little active. In addition to the hot lateral market, H&H has also weathered some retirements. And O’Donnell reports that of the partners that left, only 14 went to other “platforms,” while the firm picked up nine lateral partners this year. However, there’s concern at the firm the issues run deeper than the partnership level:

“They have so many good, quality people that are 10-, 12-, 14-year lawyers but aren’t partners,” said one former Holland & Hart partner who requested anonymity in discussing firm affairs. “They’re leaving to go be partners.”

In response to this sentiment, H&H has added a new, non-equity partnership. We’ll see if that’s enough to keep young attorneys at the firm.

# MoFo's Embarrassing Treatment Of A New Mother
## The firm is about to get dragged again for how it handles new mothers.

Sometimes, despite your best laid plans, life has a way of sneaking up and straight clowning you. Take, for example, this story that comes from the hallowed halls of Biglaw, at the firm of Morrison & Foerster.

MoFo, as you may have heard,[ is currently facing a $100 million pregnancy discrimination lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/mofo-hit-with-100-million-pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1). The complaint alleges the “mommy track” is alive and well at the firm and it will hurt your career trajectory if you have kids while at the firm:

When a female attorney at MoFo is pregnant, has children, or takes maternity leave, the firm’s standard operating procedure is to hold her back from advancement with her peers, denying her opportunities for greater pay and limiting her progression… MoFo has long been aware of these problems but has failed to take remedial measures to prevent or correct them.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The firm’s chairman, Larren Nashelsky, has felt the need to [publicly defend the firm and its policies for mothers](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/04/mofo-between-disappointed-and-angry-over-mommy-track-lawsuit/), saying they’re “somewhere between disappointed and angry”:

“It’s just not who we are, it’s not what we value and it’s, in fact, not how we operate,” Nashelsky said. “We are a diverse firm increasingly led by women lawyers that has been at the forefront of diversity of all kinds for decades now.”
….
The firm pays for child care for lawyers on trial and will pay to have breast milk shipped home for lawyers who are traveling. There are four certified coaches on staff to help lawyers returning from leave. “That’s a flavor for all of the things we do, and although it’s always unfortunate when someone brings an action against you,” Nashelsky said, “it’s why we are somewhere between disappointed and angry that the reputation of the firm [is being portrayed] as being anything other than a leader in the area of diversity and promotion and support of women lawyers and expecting mothers and fathers.”

Bold words. That’s why it must really sting that the firm is about to get dragged again for how it handles new mothers.

Yesterday, a post went up in the Facebook group Moms in Tech. It seems there was an event in the San Francisco office of MoFo and one of the speakers was a lactating mom. So far, so good. But when she actually needed to, you know, pump, she was denied access to the firm’s Mother’s Room because she was “not one of the attorneys,” she was merely a guest.

The speaker reports the firm was “adamant” in their refusal to let her use the accommodations they created FOR BREASTFEEDING MOMS. Instead, the INVITED GUEST was directed to an individual toilet.

I’d hate to see where you’d have to pump if you fell lower in the hierarchy than “invited guest.”

It’s not like this woman was some vagabond off the street looking for a clean place to do a line — because if she had been, MoFo wouldn’t have even let her use the bathroom. But that’s as close as you can come to the male equivalent; the firm telling a male speaker that the bathrooms are reserved for attorneys and directing them to go piss on the street. Of course, that would never happen, because letting a man invited to speak at the firm “use the facilities” is just a goddamned common courtesy.

The lactation room shouldn’t be any different. On top of the gross insensitivity and the archaic availability of proper facilities to express milk, the firm was just being straight-up rude to a guest.

Do you think this is the way MoFo would have treated a client? Or do you think that they would have found a way around their “only for attorneys” rule?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We reached out to Morrison & Foerster about this incident, and a firm spokesperson said they have apologized to the mother:

First and foremost, we’d like to apologize to [the new mother] for her experience. A partner from Morrison & Foerster’s leadership team has reached out directly to [the invited speaker] to discuss what happened. We are also looking into the details and will make it right. Morrison & Foerster is committed to providing a workplace that is supportive of all working mothers, including employees and guests, who require access to our mother’s room facilities.

There’s an entire societal shift that needs to take place. New mothers need clean places to express breastmilk while they are going about their professional lives. A common bathroom is not an acceptable substitute. Everybody needs to pitch in and figure this out.

# Why $180k Is The Wrong Way To Motivate Associates And Attract Top Talent
## Perhaps law firms should start thinking more holistically about what associates want in a workplace -- beyond the big paycheck.

All the recent headlines about law firms [increasing associate salary to $180,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) makes me wonder, what do the associates give up in exchange for that higher salary? While the other BigLaw firms scramble to match Cravath’s salary, what’s missing from the conversation is this — does the increased monetary compensation translate into attracting and retaining top talent?

It seems to me, throwing out an outrageous salary to attract and retain talent is an outdated model for building a successful business. What the data indicates is that what Millennials actually want isn’t a bigger paycheck but rather, [finding meaning, purpose, and satisfaction](http://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/millennialsurvey.html) in the work that they do. I actually do not believe these are traits that only Millennials seek. Of course, everyone wants to feel a sense of purpose in their work, however, Millennials are more willing to leave their job in order to find it.

According to [The Deloitte Millennial Survey 2016](http://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/millennialsurvey.html):

Forty-four percent of Millennials say, if given the choice, they would like to leave their current employers in the next two years. A perceived lack of leadership-skill development and feelings of being overlooked are compounded by larger issues around work/life balance, the desire for flexibility, and a conflict of values.

My Inbox is full of incredibly unhappy attorneys in Biglaw who are looking for an escape. It’s unfortunate because there is so much data about how to create a better workplace that uses the intrinsic motivation of its employees rather than extrinsic motivation (such as higher salary).

As discussed in this [FastCompany article](http://www.fastcompany.com/3048751/the-future-of-work/happy-employees-are-12-more-productive-at-work), “conventional wisdom holds that if only we pay workers enough, they’ll be productive. There may be more to it, though. Recent research hints there’s a link between employees’ happiness and their productivity at work.”

Google is a company known for making employee satisfaction a priority. Laszlo Bock, the Senior Vice President of People Operations at Google wrote a book, Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead. Google isn’t shy about discussing this issue.

At Google, we know that health, family and wellbeing are an important aspect of Googlers’ lives. We have also noticed that employees who are happy … demonstrate increased motivation … [We] … work to ensure that Google is… an emotionally healthy place to work.

Lara Harding, People Programs Manager, Google.

Another company that is putting a heavy emphasis on employee wellness is Ernst and Young:

Supporting our people must begin at the most fundamental level – their physical and mental health and wellbeing. It is only from strong foundations that they can handle … complex issues.

Matthew Thomas, Manager – Employee Relations, Ernst and Young.

Law firms must start focusing on creating a better work environment and stop viewing happiness and satisfaction as things that can be fixed with higher salaries.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Although law is usually slow in adoption, law firms are recognizing this reality that employee satisfaction, happiness, and wellness matters.

Recently, [Kirkland & Ellis](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/05/03/kirkland-ellis-lawyers-to-get-emotional-fitness-training/) started offering mindfulness training, firmwide. Partner Linda Myers, who sits on Kirkland’s 15-member management committee, shared the reason for the mindfulness program:

The business case for the program dictates that healthier employees are more productive, making “them better for your army, if you will,” Myers said. Young lawyers now stay at firms for shorter periods than previous generations…

Google also offers mindfulness training to its employees as part of their wellness program. The program was so successful that it is now an independent company known as [Search Inside Yourself](https://siyli.org/) and affectionately called “SIYLI.”

As Bock explains in a recent podcast episode of [Hidden Brain](http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=480976042), at Google, the basic belief for creating a happier workplace is this: it starts with a presumption or an assumption that people are fundamentally good and giving people a sense of ownership creates a more caring environment.

Bock shared:

[W]e have a lot of vehicles where people can exert their freedom, feel ownership for things. We give them a lot of channels to express voice, whether it’s through, the particulars ways we do surveys or ask people for input, but also by encouraging people to feel like the company is less hierarchical.

Of course, employers aren’t solely responsible for employee’s sense of happiness, belonging, and purpose. There are [many simple and practical](http://www.fastcompany.com/3048751/the-future-of-work/happy-employees-are-12-more-productive-at-work) ways for you to increase your own own feeling of happiness at the workplace. According to Shawn Anchor, author of The Happiness Advantage:

Research suggests there are some simple ways [employees can boost their own happiness](https://hbr.org/2012/01/positive-intelligence/ar/1), like helping out co-workers, [meditating for at least two minutes every day](http://www.fastcompany.com/3035250/hit-the-ground-running/the-new-habit-challenge-meditate-for-20-minutes-a-day), and reflecting on three things to be grateful for at work.

Perhaps law firms should start thinking more holistically about what associates want in a workplace — beyond the big paycheck.

I want to hear from you! What is your law firm doing to increase work satisfaction? What are your thoughts about happiness at work? I invite you to drop me an email at [hello@jeenacho.com](mailto:hello@jeenacho.com) and share your thoughts.

Amici are 368 individuals but they speak for many more of the past, present, and future members of the legal profession who have, like one in four American women, terminated a pregnancy in their lifetimes. As members of a profession that, in its shining moments, has allowed those with legal training to stand up for those who cannot advocate for themselves, amici feel uniquely empowered, equipped, and, indeed, compelled to come forward with their names and stories on behalf of those who still cannot do so.

Amici submit this brief, some at immeasurable personal and professional cost, for the countless others who may not have the tools to navigate the legal system to secure all that the Constitution and the Court have rightfully promised them.

Summer vacation season may be over, but the holidays will be here soon enough. Many in-house lawyers are able to completely unplug — able to leave their computers and work phones at home (lucky!). Others, however, may still need to bring their laptops or at the very least, their phones. These tips are for you.

Trust The Away Message

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In my most recent post about vacation, I shared the importance of having a detailed away message. I believe that importance still rings true. Recall that there are three key parts. One is obviously sharing that you are away and setting the expectation of when you will be able to substantively respond to messages. The second part is sharing who the sender can reach out to in your absence. (Obviously, you set that up beforehand). The last part is sharing why you are out.

After you have set your away message, trust it. Resist the urge to respond to emails while you are out. Otherwise, you are setting the contrary expectation to your message and encouraging more emails. Channel Disney’s “Frozen,” and do your best to let it go.

Take Your Phone With You (And Leave Your Computer At Home If You Can)

This advice may seem counterintuitive, but hear me out. If you have ever come back from a two-week vacation to hundreds of emails, that is where my advice comes from. Depending on your personality, there can be stress associated with FOMO — fear of missing out on an important email from a client (ahem, chief legal officer) or the stress of returning to the office with hundreds of unread or unfiled emails.

Personally, as in-house counsel, I prefer to have my phone with me so I can check and file emails — but I don’t want the laptop so I can resist doing any substantive work. I don’t actually carry my work phone with me the entire day. Rather, it’s at the hotel room or house I have rented, and I only check at certain times.

Set Times For Checking Email And Stick To Them

To resist working on your vacation, determine a time (and how long) you will spend checking your email daily and stick to it. It may depend on your time zone. If you have family, consider making this determination with them. For me, when I was vacationing in Florida, an hour ahead of the office, and my clients were either Pacific Time Zone or Central Time Zone, I checked my email in the afternoon (after beach or pool time) and after putting the kids to bed and spent no more than 30 minutes, skimming and filing, with an occasional forwarding of an email to a colleague who had graciously agreed to cover me while on vacation. The role is not to substantively respond to email but rather to “direct traffic.” It is not lost on me that you may want to respond to clients from a relationship-building perspective but keep it short — and focused on directing them to help without compromising your vacation.

While these tips are not “work-free,” hopefully they will allow you to intentionally enjoy your time off while ensuring your return is less stressful.

[ [1]](#reff1) While my column is focused on tips for in-house counsel, I collaborated with my friend, Niloy, who is at a firm, to create some “universal” tips, regardless of your practice.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Won't Reopen Its U.S. Offices Until February 2022
## The Delta variant has really thrown a wrench into this firm's plans.

Biglaw firms were once so hopeful that they’d be able to launch full-scale office reopenings this year. Welcoming lawyers and staff back to the office in September was the goal for many firms. Some were able to make it happen, but many others decided to delay their proposed reopenings until October. Now, with October less than a month away, several firms have opted to call 2021 a loss, aiming to get back into the office in early 2022.

That’s what’s happening at West Coast mainstay Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. The firm has now set the latest 2022 reopening date of any law firm yet.

The firm originally planned to [reopen its U.S. offices on September 20](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/wsgr-reopening/), complete with full services and amenities. Although all of the firm’s offices would be open, no one would actually be required to return in 2021; a physical presence in a WSGR office would be completely voluntary. Then, COVID-19’s Delta variant quickly trashed those carefully laid plans, leading the firm to announce that its full reopening would instead [take place on October 25](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/wsgr-delays-opening-delta/), with a new requirement that anyone hoping to return to the office would have to be fully vaccinated. With vaccine hesitancy and COVID infections still running high, the firm has decided to postpone its full reopening to February 1, 2022.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Doug Clark, Wilson Sonsini’s managing partner, sent out a firmwide memo (available in full on the next page) yesterday afternoon detailing the latest plans:

The reasons for postponing the October re-opening date are straightforward. We remain in a volatile situation in many of our U.S. locations, in terms of COVID-19 transmission due to the Delta variant. We also remain subject to various restrictive regulations and guidance concerning COVID safety protocols, including masking, social distancing, and remedial measures in the event of infections. It is an unfortunate landscape, but the best thing we can do is to continue to focus on the health of our firm community and support virtual work. Our offices remain available, of course, to those who need to access them in order to serve our clients most effectively.

Why February 1? While it remains theoretically possible that we could reopen sooner than that, we wanted to give people stability and predictability as to our timing through the holiday season. In addition, we wanted to align the reopening of offices with the task of implementing measures arising from the work of the Office of the Future Task Force….

What, exactly, has the firm’s Office of the Future Task Force been working on? Some new measures WSGR employees can look forward to seeing include the implementation of “hoteling in a thoughtful way” and working with attorneys and staff to “identify[] local norms that may influence the frequency of office attendance.” Next week, the firm’s “Project Hybrid” will be discussed.

It certainly sounds like a lot of innovative work has been going on behind the scenes at Wilson Sonsini to create the Biglaw workplace of the future. Attorneys and staff will have to wait until next year to see what their new hybrid office life looks like.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

It’s becoming both easier and more popular to make a geographic lateral move to another Biglaw firm as an associate. This is the result of a few trends:

- The expansion of the [Uniform Bar Exam](https://bit.ly/3LuKl8h) (UBE) to more states across the country means that it’s easier for lawyers to get admitted into multiple states at once and/or transfer bar exam results from one state to another.
- More associates are motivated to move than ever.  The pandemic has accelerated a variety of personal and professional reasons to change where and how Biglaw associates are working.
- Practice groups at Biglaw firms are also “nationalizing,” meaning that if a firm has demand for talent in a particular legal service, they will look to staff up across multiple offices. 
But when it comes to considering a geographic move as a Biglaw lateral associate, it is hard to know where to start.  Here are answers to some FAQs on the process:

How do I find a legal recruiter for my geographic move?

Most legal recruiters are identified through personal referrals. But if you don’t know any attorneys in your target market, this might not be possible. Conduct an online search and take a look at some legal recruiter directories. Most recruiters are clear on their websites about who they work with and where. (Through [Gridline Search + Consulting](https://bit.ly/3S4aHQV), for example, I primarily work with New York City firms, DC firms, Boston firms, and Bay Area firms, using recruiter connections and industry knowledge I gained through my time as a law school career advisor.)

I like my current firm. I just need to move geographically for personal reasons. Should I just ask for an office transfer?

Maybe. But does that other office have the practice area that you work in? Is the culture of the other office the same as your current one? Do you know anyone in the new office that would be interested in advocating for your office transfer? Will your current team help you make the move or will it be hard for them to let you go? If the answers to these questions present complications, it may be best to look for a new employer in your target market.

When is the right time to make a geographic move?

As a Biglaw associate, you are most marketable for a lateral move with two to five years of experience. This is generally true whether you are looking to stay in the same market or make a geographic move.

I am expecting a year-end bonus from my current firm.  Should I wait until I receive it to start looking?

No.  When making a geographic lateral move, you want to take advantage of opportunities when they exist.  If you wait several months before you even start looking, you may miss out on a key opening or need.  Additionally, your recruiter can help you navigate the timing of a start date or possibly negotiate coverage of any lost bonus by the new firm.

What if I am not admitted into the state where I plan to move?

Start by taking a look at the bar admission resources provided by the [National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE)](https://bit.ly/3Lwgtbv). If you are a junior associate admitted to a UBE state, you may still be able to port that score to another UBE state. If you are a senior associate, you may be eligible for “admission by motion” to the new state based on your years of continuous practice in your current state. If something is unclear from a website or written resource, don’t rely on word of mouth. Reach out to the state’s board of bar examiners directly.

Firms will require that you eventually be admitted into the state where they are located. If you ultimately need to take a new bar exam, sometimes the firm will even give you time off and cover expenses while employed at the new firm. (This is more often provided to corporate associates making a lateral move than to litigation associates).

Will the firm fly me out for an interview? Will they pay the expenses?

When interviewing a candidate from another market, most large firms will start with a video screening interview. After this, there will be at least one round of full interviews, with most Biglaw firms also doing these interviews virtually. If the firm requires an in-person interview, most large law firms will pay for reasonable expenses related to this trip.

Will the new firm pay for my relocation expenses?

In most cases, yes they will. In terms of the exact amount and method, this is something that typically gets negotiated when an offer of employment is made through your recruiter.

My spouse got a new job already, so I need to make the move as soon as possible. How long does the process typically take?

Timing for a geographic move as a lateral associate depends on a lot of factors – your target market, your level of experience, your practice, your current firm, your credentials, etc. It could take a couple weeks to move or it could take several months or more. You will want to talk with your recruiter about the urgency of your timing and what you can expect for timing.

# Democracy Or Dictatorship? You'll Tear Your Hair Out Either Way

Consider first a dictatorship:

“You say this.  He says that.  I can’t bear the quibbling.  We’re doing X.  Go execute it.”

That’s the dictatorial style.  It has its advantages:  You have a decision; you know what you’re doing; you can carry out your marching orders.

But you will, of course, tear your hair out over it:  You must get to the dictator first.  When the dictator is about to say something silly, you must influence the dictator quickly.  If the dictator makes the wrong decision, you must meet with the dictator privately, and convince the dictator that the dictator didn’t mean what he (or she) said.  Meetings with the dictator are likely to be uncomfortable.  Why should a person have to deal with this?

Consider next a democracy: 

“You say this.  He says that.  We don’t seem to have yet reached a consensus, even among ourselves.  Please send out an email to some people explaining what the positions are.  After you send the email, we’ll look at the responses.  Then we’ll schedule a meeting to discuss this.  See what time is open on all of our calendars a couple of weeks from now.  I understand that the issue requires a quick decision, but I want to come to agreement among ourselves before I make a recommendation to management.”

That’s the democratic style.  It has its advantages:  All opinions are respected; everyone gets to express themselves; if you do reach an agreement, everyone will be happy.

But you will, of course, tear your hair out over it:  We need a decision, for heaven’s sake!  Opportunity is passing us by!  It doesn’t really matter if we do X or Y, so long as we know what direction we’re heading in.  We’ll never reach a consensus, and now we have to waste time writing emails and having meetings, even though that process won’t take us anywhere.  Why should a person have to deal with this?

I have some bad news for you:  You pays your money and you takes your choice.  You can have type one:  the boss (or partner) who’s decisive and moves things forward.  Or you can have type two:  the boss (or partner) who strives for consensus.  But you can’t have both simultaneously.

So:  Hope for a happy medium.  Hope for a boss who listens to a decent amount of debate, closes the debate, and then makes a decision.  That’s all you can ask for.

And don’t be too offended by the person you’re working with.  Everyone will occasionally be a little too dictatorial, or a little too democratic, for your taste.  That’s life.

Don’t ask for perfection.  Don’t ask for someone whose taste for discussion will always, precisely match yours.  That won’t happen.

Just ask for someone who’s reasonable; understand that people’s tastes will always vary; and accept the fact that you’ll always think that the boss was unreasonable in one way or the other.

Today’s a helluva day, isn’t it? As the eagerly anticipated election day unfolds, there’s a lot of anxiety floating around. Yes, the polls have consistently shown Joe Biden with ~8 point lead, but well, 2016 left a mark. People have a lot of feelings, I mean, I could cry hot tears of anger and frustration if I think about it too hard.

What I really need atm is some light, yet uplifting content to distract. With that in mind, let me direct you to a charming little interview DLA Piper partner (on a sabbatical) and wannabe Second Gentleman of the United States of America Doug Emhoff did with [Fatherly](https://www.fatherly.com/).

The interview gives you some insight into Emhoff’s culinary predilections (he’s totally right about the apple pie, btw), super hero thoughts, and what’s in his future if (hopefully) his wife becomes vice president.

Enjoy!

Kids ask [@DouglasEmhoff](https://twitter.com/DouglasEmhoff?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) (you might know him as Kamala Harris' husband) questions about food, superheroes, and, sure, politics. [pic.twitter.com/GNwlok7tMM](https://t.co/GNwlok7tMM)

# Intro To Social Media For Lawyers
## A brief overview of my favorite social media platforms.

In recent weeks, I’ve been having a lot of conversations about lawyers on social media. Lots of people want to post content or build relationships online because it can be a great way to do business development, find a new career opportunity, or network with peers. The problem is that most people don’t know how to get started or can’t figure out which platform to focus on. So today I’ll share a quick rundown of the four platforms I’m most familiar with:

LinkedIn: Humblebrag Your Way To Riches

This is, hands down, the most commonly used platform by lawyers. Probably because the platform started off as a place to brag about your professional accomplishments. Most people are accustomed to using LinkedIn to find new jobs, but over the past few years, it’s emerged as a place where you can find interesting content and conversations related to the professional world. Having said that, it’s still full of humblebrags and cringey content so be prepared for that.

The good news is that most people there are extroverts and *want* to connect with each other, so you can build your network quickly. Some [entrepreneurial lawyers have even built entire businesses](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/overnight-success-2-decades-in-the-making/) around their audience there. I think LinkedIn is different from most other platforms because people on there have to use their real names and job titles, which lends a certain level of accountability to the interactions. There are fewer trolls on LinkedIn than anywhere else.

Twitter: The Best Way To Impress Other Lawyers

This is the best platform for lawyers to share thought leadership. There’s a ton of quality posts on Twitter, especially when it comes to the latest legal developments. You can build your professional network there too, although it’s a bit harder than on LinkedIn. That’s because Twitter lawyers are generally less interested in networking for its own sake, and more interested in learning or joking around.

What are the challenges? Well, the bar for quality content is pretty high on Twitter. It’s difficult for your posts to stand out from everyone else’s. Those who are successful on LinkedIn try to bring the same type of positivity and earnestness to Twitter but it often receives a lukewarm reception. It’s a tough game. But if you are able to build a following on Twitter, you’ll gain a certain level of credibility that you can’t get anywhere else.

Instagram: Make Them Jealous Of Your Life

This is the platform for showing your personal side on social media. Historically, Instagram has been a place to share curated, aesthetically pleasing image — whether they’re of your family, your travels, or yourself. I still remember when I created my account. Back then, it was all about posting pictures of your food. In recent years though, the content has evolved to include other types of material. In fact, some of the [biggest legal memelords](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/the-making-of-a-biglaw-memelord/) out there built their reputations on Instagram.

Having said that, most of what I see from lawyers on the platform is still curated images. If LinkedIn is the best way to brag about your professional life, then Instagram is the best way to brag about your personal life. One major change I do see coming to IG though, is that there’s going to be less of a focus on pictures and more of a focus on short form videos — the [platform is prioritizing Reels](https://www.engadget.com/instagram-2022-priorities-video-creators-transparency-messaging-adam-mosseri-213020718.html) as a way to stay competitive against TikTok.

TikTok: Are You Cool Enough? 

This is the Wild West of social media. Most of TikTok’s user base is still relatively young, but it’s still pretty useful for [some lawyers to market themselves or their practices](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/should-lawyers-use-tiktok-for-marketing/). The algorithm is incredibly good — [it relies on “watch time”](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-tiktok-algorithm-for-you-page-works-watch-time-report-2021-7) to determine what other types of content to show you, which ends up being a pretty strong predictor of what you like. Plus, the way that it’s designed makes the videos easily shareable by others on competing social media platforms and group texts.

The challenge there though is that your videos have to be engaging or entertaining or else the content won’t get very many views. Most lawyers are unaccustomed to the video format — we’re more comfortable with text and writing. Which is kind of an opportunity, too. Like Twitter, it’s kind of tough to win over the crowd, but if you can pull it off — the organic reach you can achieve is unparalleled. The [fourth video I ever posted on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@legaltechbro/video/6892094649180212486?is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=6892094649180212486&web_id=7055824250150454790) received over 2 million views even though I had zero followers at the time.

Conclusion

When it comes to social media, there’s no single best platform. It all comes down to what your ultimate goals are. Not everyone needs to go viral (but if that is your goal, you should check out this breakdown I wrote about [how to create viral posts](https://www.alexofftherecord.com/p/targeted-virality)). And not everyone needs to have a social media presence, but given how many potential clients, hiring managers, and lawyers are active on various platforms today, you should probably at least dip your toe in the water.

# To JD Or Not JD ...
## Among the good news this week, a woman won the Nobel in economics (and got a check for the same amount as the men did).

The Department of Education recently announced [new rules](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2021/nfrgeunofficialcopy.pdf?utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery&utm_term=) that will increase transparency for graduate programs — including law schools. Now, peeps considering law school will have a much better sense of how much that J.D. is going to cost them and [whether the juice is worth the squeeze](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/but-wait-how-much-does-going-to-law-school-really-cost/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=277255839&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_5MTkOj89HihWeQABC5V1ZtEopIig_wvZw4tckje9p_xZ-PQpuusU5RafVnA40OyibbGAI1iZwqhrYv5nGIan-cl2O0Q&utm_content=277255839&utm_source=hs_email), especially given how long and hard it can be to find that first job after passing the bar. Collection of the data begins next year.

Combine that information with bar passage rates, and prospective students should be able to make informed decisions about whether — or not — to go for the degree. Most readers of this column know all too well that law school is a huge investment of both time and money. Any information that helps peeps decide is a step in the right direction. Otherwise, some unfortunate law students may end up like the characters in John Grisham’s novel “[The Rooster Bar](https://www.amazon.com/Rooster-Bar-Novel-John-Grisham/dp/1101967706/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1696809446&sr=8-1),” which I found true to life, hilarious in spots, but sad in others.

Should prospective law school students be able to use AI in law school applications? There seems to be [a split of authority](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/law-school-wannabes-dont-think-you-should-be-able-to-use-chatgpt-to-get-through-the-application-process/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=276915911&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-937kdHUQeahVT2qOUGTW_tsrKwG6yPO1ssH0KMJkukAslPTeqVJJqHTUJaJFMnd9uYB4pGQx2XC1-R4_S8YH1Lv_bJDQ&utm_content=276915911&utm_source=hs_email), with Michigan nixing its use. However, if you want to apply to Arizona State, you are free to use it. The silence you hear from other law schools is deafening.

How would you define “greed” today? There’s penny-ante greed when some client pleads poverty and can’t pay the lawyer’s bills (we’ve all been there}. There’s greed on another scale altogether when Elon Musk claims that the law firm that represented him in his acquisition of Twitter (now X) is the poster law firm for greed. Musk is trying to keep his [fee dispute with Wachtell out of arbitration](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/elon-musk-accuses-wachtell-greed/?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=277133406&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Xa3YsHtsW39tPVwwYBgTA_urlq5evBPPGHSE0ux4zJfGgwEhDwVuX7qM1qRxk7WU5OqQPOLEXblDyWRva0Uz_FKfVBw&utm_content=277133406&utm_source=hs_email).

Does the concept of “greedy lawyers” (and where have we heard that term before?) preclude the fee dispute being heard in arbitration? Discuss.

Who is a “victim?” Ron DeSantis, presidential wannabe and Florida’s governor, is bewailing his Ivy League education as detrimental to his ambitions. His [graduations from Yale and then Harvard Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/ron-desantis-claims-victimhood-for-having-attended-yale-and-harvard-law/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=277101481&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kwHosdxG1kNn7X4guoUyCGWiFKMALlGlP3ZxzRB5ebrqOvQGdOkYe0mHMt278_0hwQ3FWR6hD9Ik2fTMvzVHFKQ5SGQ&utm_content=277101481&utm_source=hs_email) have placed, in his mind, a “scarlet letter” on his forehead with the voters he seeks to wrestle away from The Donald. We should all be such victims.

How many lawyers would happily trade places for those pedigreed degrees? I see too many raised hands to count. How hilarious that those assets are now seen as liabilities.

A New Jersey P.I. lawyer is calling himself the “[funniest lawyer in New Jersey](https://www.funniestlawyernewjersey.com/),” so dubbed after winning “contests sponsored by the bar association at Rascals Comedy Club.” I leave it to you to decide if that title is apt. His website doesn’t indicate which bar association and/or how many contests. Wouldn’t you want to know the answers to those questions?

Some good news for women general counsel. (About time). According to one 2023 report, [women GCs are making approximately 8% more](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/women-are-actually-winning-at-this-gender-pay-gap/2/) than the men.

Encouraging for sure but there’s still a long way to go for overall gender pay parity in our profession.

What’s even better news is that the [2023 Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to Claudia Goldin](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/business/economy/claudia-goldin-nobel-prize-economics.html), a Harvard economics professor. What did she win for? Her research into reasons for gender gaps in the workplace, due to labor participation and earnings. She’s only the third woman to win this prize, and it serves as recognition, finally, of what women have known for years:  having children penalizes women both in earnings and the ability to move forward in their careers. Nothing new there, but at least the Nobel adds credibility to what women have been saying for decades. As the New York Times reported, “Dr. Goldin has shown that most of the earnings difference is now between men and women in the same jobs, the Nobel Committee said. Notably, it kicks in after the birth of a woman’s first child.” Calling Captain Obvious.

Meanwhile, Biglaw is seeing [an exodus of women lawyers](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/has-the-summer-of-powerful-women-left-biglaw-behind?source=newsletter&item=headline&region=digest) for several reasons including mistaking women for paralegals (does that ever happen to men?), having children (see above), and the old — but clearly not forgotten — issue of sexual harassment, which still takes many forms.

Anyone remember the [Lewis Brisbois spinoff Barber/Ranen](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/aftershocks-barber-ranens-racist-sexist-email-disaster-2023-06-08/) and how that firm imploded when emails of the labor and employment name partners became public knowledge? And that was just a few months ago.

And this is definitely good news: the NextGen bar exam, scheduled to debut in July 2026, will be a whole three hours shorter! Good news for everyone, especially those who need breaks or have physical issues that make sitting for long stretches difficult or impossible. We dinosaurs remember [the three-day bar exam](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/new-bar-exam-shaves-three-hours-off-testing-time-2023-09-12/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Issue:%202023-09-15%20Legal%20Dive%20%5Bissue:54543%5D&utm_term=Legal%20Dive), which was a test not only of legal knowledge, and how to pass the multi-state, but a test of endurance.

Those three days were not only a “write” of passage, but a rite of passage as well. (Pun intended.) Driving a stake through the heart of an unnecessary marathon is long overdue.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Why My Kids Don’t Want To Be Lawyers
## Success in work and family comes down to choices.

I have two young kids, aged 5 and 7, who I love with all my heart. No matter how busy work gets, I’m usually able to get home in time to tuck them into bed. As part of our routine, I tell them that if they use their minds and work hard, they can do anything they want. I then ask them what they want to be when they grow up. On any given evening they might tell me they want to be a doctor, a paleontologist, an engineer, or an American Ninja Warrior. There’s one profession that’s never come up, though: lawyer.

Law runs in my blood. Even as a little boy, I remember wanting to be a lawyer like my dad. My father was a government lawyer for much of his career, and a good one. I was proud of him. I thought he did amazing things, and I wanted to be just like him. From as far back as I can remember, I was aiming to be an attorney. I worked as a summer file clerk at a law firm in college to get legal experience. I went straight to law school out of college. After earning my J.D., I went back to the firm I’d started at, put my nose to the grindstone, and started working my way through the ranks. Today, I find myself in my dad’s shoes, raising young children, trying to give them the world, and perhaps holding more than a flicker of hope inside myself that they, too, might want to grow up to be a lawyer like me.

But they don’t. And it leaves me wondering why.

Why Would You Want To Be A Lawyer?

There are plenty of reasons for a grown-up to not want to become a lawyer in today’s marketplace. Law school is expensive, and job opportunities are nowhere near what they were before the Great Recession. The legal market is changing, becoming more competitive and business-like. The classical notion of the revered, noble lawyer is fading away, and with it much of the romance associated with the profession. Plus, the population of lawyers tends to have an overrepresentation of people who struggle with stress, depression, and substance abuse.

But my kids don’t care about any of that. Grade schoolers aren’t considering ROI on their student loans, potential take-home salary, or the mystique of the [sage attorney](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/the-war-on-law-firms/). They want a job that sounds fun and interesting, like finding dinosaur bones. I can tell myself that law doesn’t have that same level of fun and cool to a kindergartener’s eyes. I can try to take some comfort in the notion that they’re not old enough to see the profession for what it really is.

But if I’m being honest, deep down, I fear they may see the profession perfectly. I worry they see it for how it impacts our family and our lives, and that’s why they want no part of it.

Screen Time Limits Aren’t Just For Kids

My family just got back from a long-planned vacation to remote parts of Idaho, and at the end of it my iPhone was kind enough to pop up my weekly screen time calculation. Over seven days of travel, family time, and relaxation, I managed to average four hours of screen time per day — and that’s not including time on the laptop or making calls.

That’s a sobering statistic, but for where my career is now it makes perfect sense. I manage a practice and an NLJ 250 law firm. Until my term as managing partner ends or I collapse, I’ve got two full-time jobs, neither of which stops just because I’m not around. This is hopefully the most demanding time my legal practice will ever see again.

That four hours of screen time felt like the bare minimum needed to keep the plates spinning in my absence. I checked emails on a lake. I typed responses on a raft. I would steal a glance at my phone any time I was somewhere it seemed like I could get a signal to make sure no crises had arisen in the 30 minutes since I checked it last. At one point, I drove our rented electric blue minivan to the top of a mountain so I could handle a conference call.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I don’t take pride in this story, nor do I consider myself unique. Most attorneys in private practice are well aware of how demanding this job can be. The business of law is intense, and succeeding requires focus, diligence, and time. Building and managing a practice is challenging and will consume every second of your life if you let it. Knowing that your decisions can impact the livelihood of other people only adds to the pressure to remain available.

We Aren’t Who We Used To Be

There’s also the basic problem of inertia. I, like many attorneys, went to law school and began my practice without a family. When I was a young lawyer with a girlfriend, I could devote virtually as much time as I wanted to work. The balance I struck in those early days seemed to stick around over time, even as my girlfriend became my wife, and as my wife and I became parents. I’m comfortable learning new areas of law or new concepts in management and business. Learning a whole new way to be a lawyer, striking a new blend of my work and home lives, is turning out to be a tougher task.

All is not lost, however. The first step to addressing a problem is identifying that it exists. I’ve known for a long time that I need a better approach to blending my work and home lives. I suspect many people reading this article know that feeling. Making the decision to change is a start.

As much as tech is part of the problem, it can also be part of the solution. My cell phone kept work at my fingertips for my entire vacation, but without it I can’t imagine being comfortable taking that vacation in the first place. I can work remotely on weekends when needed, if only so I can sneak in a few minutes for tee ball practice or to watch part of The Incredibles with my kids. Technology is good and evil, so we need to make it work for us — not enslave us.

Choosing Better

Success in work and family life comes down to choices. I can, and will, choose to keep work from destroying my family life. I also can, and will, choose to encourage others in my firm to do the same, to care for and balance their lives so that they’re better lawyers and better people. And as a profession, I hope we can stop viewing masochistic work schedules and related blood on the ground as a badge of honor — especially when the blood comes from our families and loved ones. We’ve worked hard to get where we are. We owe it to ourselves to make this profession a sustainable one.

I don’t know if my kids will ever want to be lawyers, and I’m genuinely fine if they don’t. There are great reasons to be a lawyer, and plenty more to not be one. As long as they can support themselves and the lives they choose to live, I’m happy.

I’ve come to understand how odd of a duck my dad really was. He was a successful lawyer, but he always ate dinner with us. He made every school event I had as a kid, every bike race, every game. He made his business life adjust to the needs of his home. He worked so he could live, while so many of us do the opposite.

I set a goal a long time ago to be like my dad. At the time, I thought it meant being a lawyer. Today, I see how much more there is to it. I’ve got a lot of job left to do, but when I start a job, I aim to finish it.

Will you join me?

Elie is deeply concerned about the media’s willingness to cave to every request of a public relations firm, mostly because some people never get to hire one. And the gang talks about other legal stuff o’ the week.

# The Next Big Announcement In Biglaw: The End Of The Office Work Week
## Don't worry, you'll still have to bill constantly.

For most of its existence, Biglaw has remained relatively conservative in outlook. Cravath would announce annual bonuses, others would follow in lockstep, partnership tracks would run eight years, and salaries would be set and then stagnate for years at a time. But the past handful of years have brought considerable upheaval. [Baker McKenzie offered the first bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-bonus-chart-2020/) last year. [Milbank’s pushing the salary envelope](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/). And the [rise of the non-equity partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/non-equity-means-non-partner/) has thrown the whole game into turmoil.

As we speak, we’re in the midst of an impromptu supplementary bonus war [kicked off by Willkie Farr](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) and then [blown out of the water by Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) — following a 2020 special bonus where Davis Polk went over the top of Cooley. It feels like everyone is jockeying to be [recognized as a market leader](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-market-leader/).

And where big, tradition-shattering announcements are the coin of the realm, what will be the next big move? At this point, you’ve got to think it’s a permanent end to the five-day office work week.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
After a year and change of working from home, and commercial real estate already reflecting [a sharp decline in office space](https://www.globest.com/2020/09/24/office-market-could-shed-145m-square-feet-in-the-next-two-years/?slreturn=20210302101630), law firms are starting to wonder if they really need to be bringing everyone back full-time. We’ve already seen [offices built with the concept of telecommuting in mind](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/biglaw-firm-designs-new-office-around-the-reality-of-telecommuting/) with cutbacks in personal office space in lieu of more [situational and collaborative spaces](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/a-look-at-boies-schillers-brand-new-offices-in-new-yorks-hottest-new-neighborhood/). As firms eye their next lease, it wouldn’t come as a surprise to see more leniency toward working from home coupled with trimming square footage.

And lest anyone think this is a bridge too far for the staid world of Biglaw, we’ve already heard rumblings. A couple of Biglaw firms have already communicated to associates that they are “considering” a permanent end to requiring full-week office attendance. Obviously, “considering” is not a final decision, but when firms not accustomed to leading the pack to mull the idea out loud, it indicates momentum is already underway among firm managers across the industry.

Now, working from home may come as cold comfort to some associates. It’s less a four-day work week than an invitation to wear sweats during your ongoing seven-day work week. But it’s still better than nothing. There’s also an advantage that I had never thought of until someone brought it to my attention the other day: normalizing working from home benefits working mothers who sometimes opt for work from home schedules and get subtly (or not so subtly) marginalized for it.

Of course there’s the possibility that Biglaw will walk away from this experience determined to seamlessly return to the pre-COVID world. Firms that only recently committed to long-term leases on glittering corporate palaces would welcome that. But it’s hard to imagine the bulk of firms staring at the remote working infrastructure they’ve built and successfully leveraged for the past year — a year in which many firms saw record revenue — and not think about trimming office space overhead.

# Biglaw Merger Mania Sweeping The Midwest
## Biglaw gets bigger.

Okay, maybe the “mania” in “merger mania” overstates the trend a tad bit, but well, we’re *still* in the middle of a freaking pandemic, and any law firm actively expanding is going to get outsized attention. Doubly so when there’s a burgeoning trend afoot.

So, what, exactly is going on? Well, Dinsmore & Shohl announced a merger with Wooden McLaughlin that became official on January 1. That gives the newly expanded Dinsmore three new offices in Indiana (in Indianapolis, Evansville and Bloomington), and it’s being [touted by the firm](https://www.dinsmore.com/news/dinsmore-completes-one-of-largest-legal-mergers-of-covid-19-pandemic-by-opening-3-offices-in-indiana/) as “one of the largest such deals of two domestic-only firms in the legal industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.” It brings the firm’s headcount to 630+, which is over a 7 percent increase. Not too shabby.

Dinsmore Chairman and Managing Partner George Vincent had this to say about the merger:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“I’ve always believed in having a renewable five-year plan and working back from where you want to be. Five years ago, we wanted to be in Boston, Florida and Indiana, and we’ve done all of those things. We are in every state surrounding Indiana, so it is a natural place for us to be. There are significant opportunities for new and existing Dinsmore clients there, and Wooden has a great legacy.”

But as observers have[ pointed out](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/01/04/midwest-merger-push-continues-in-2021-as-dinsmore-announces-acquisition/), it isn’t the only midwest push for Biglaw. [Just last month](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/dentons-continues-golden-spike-expansion-as-it-announces-combination-with-iowa-law-firm), megafirm Dentons announced a combination with Iowa law firm Davis Brown. That merger is part of Dentons “Project Golden Spike,” which is a dual-partnership model that allows for local decision making. The new law firm will operate as Dentons Davis Brown.

Elliott Portnoy, Global CEO of Dentons, [said this](https://www.dentons.com/en/whats-different-about-dentons/connecting-you-to-talented-lawyers-around-the-globe/news/2020/december/dentons-announces-combination-with-davis-brown-iowas-leading-law-firm) of the merger:

“We are delighted to be combining with Davis Brown in Iowa, a major financial services and insurance hub, and a key and growing market for our clients with Des Moines’ external legal spend exceeding that of the entire country of India. Like Dentons, Davis Brown and its lawyers are repeatedly recognized for the quality of their legal service and their focus on inclusion and diversity and our combination means we can connect clients to leading talent in Iowa and in 77 countries around the world.”

Joe Andrew, Global Chair of the firm, noted the combination makes Dentons “the first global law firm in Iowa and gets us one step closer to becoming the first truly national US law firm.”

Thanks to Project Golden Spike and other expansion initiatives, Dentons announced an eye-popping 28 new offices around the world in 2020. Impressive indeed.

Early in the pandemic, the video conference provider Zoom had taken the legal industry by storm, according to a survey [released this week](https://www.iltanet.org/resources/publications/surveys/2020tsparticipate?ssopc=1) by the International Legal Technology Association.

The platform was listed by 71% of law firms that participated in the ILTA’s 2020 Technology Survey as video conferencing (desktop, laptop, and phone) software that they use, up from 34% in 2019. Microsoft Teams followed at 48%, an increase from 12% the prior year, and Cisco WebEx placed third at 30%, unchanged from 2019. 

The same three platforms led law firms’ web conference and webinar hosting preferences, with Zoom at 71% — up from 27% the prior year — Microsoft Teams at 38%, and WebEx at 32%, a drop from 34% in 2019.

But a[ report in Legaltech News](https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2020/10/27/6-things-we-found-interesting-from-the-2020-ilta-tech-survey/) detailing the ILTA survey notes that it “hasn’t been all good news for Zoom”:

The platform’s boost in activity has also been accompanied by some fairly public cybersecurity incidents, some even[ taking place](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2020/07/10/hacker-streams-porn-into-florida-court-hearing-by-infiltrating-zoom/) inside of legal. So why did Zoom still take the top spot in ILTA’s survey? [Beth Anne Stuebe, director of publications and press at ILTA,] pointed out that the survey was conducted just before and during the early days of the pandemic. ‘[Zoom] is what people were already using. They didn’t want to deviate immediately when the pandemic hit,’ she said. However, Stuebe predicts that Zoom will continue to be popular through the end of the pandemic now that the platform has had a chance to adjust to the increased traffic.

# Biglaw Firms Are Now Offering Menopause Support Packages To Employees
## Hopefully your firm will decide to offer important benefit policies like these soon if it’s not doing so already.

Here at Above the Law, we regularly cover news concerning the way Biglaw firms address their employees’ journey into parenthood, from the expansion of family-planning benefits to include fertility treatments to enhanced parental-leave for new parents and compassionate-leave plans for those who have experienced miscarriages or failed fertility treatments. It’s rare, however, that we’re able to cover programs that cater to employees who are the opposite end of the spectrum — those who are experiencing menopause.

Progress is now on the horizon, as several Magic Circle firms have adopted menopause policies and support packages — and the latest to do so is making them available on a global basis.

While Freshfields and Clifford Chance offer these opportunities to their UK employees, Linklaters recently announced menopause programming that extends to all employees in all offices. Not only is the firm offering access to an app called Peppy Health that will provide support to menopausal employees, but insurance coverage for specialists who treat conditions related to menopause will now be available. [Law360](https://www.law360.com/publicpolicy/articles/1491702/linklaters-is-latest-uk-firm-to-implement-menopause-policy) has more information:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“Menopause symptoms can have a detrimental impact on anybody living with them, and their working lives are not exempt from that,” said Jessamy Gallagher, executive committee champion for age and life stage at Linklaters, in a statement Tuesday. “It can also indirectly affect anyone, including those supporting a partner or family member living through the menopause.”

The firm is expanding its menopause support group and creating learning modules for management and anyone in a supervising role.

“People should not have to navigate the menopause in silence,” Gallagher said. “I hope that our policy and enhanced support will encourage open discussion and further strengthen our culture of openness and our commitment to caring for our people at every stage of their lives.”

According to Gallagher, Linklaters hopes to “retain and support women of all ages into senior roles,” and this is certainly a benevolent way to do so.

Will other firms be willing to step up and assist menopausal employees? This is something we’ll keep an eye on. Hopefully your firm will decide to offer important benefit policies like these soon if it’s not doing so already.

# Biglaw Partner Rebuked Over Road Rage Incident
## Not exactly behavior becoming a lawyer.

Willkie Farr partner [Boris Bronfentrinker ](https://www.willkie.com/professionals/b/bronfentrinker-boris), who works in the firm’s London office, was rebuked by the Solicitors Regulation Authority following a road rage episode. Bronfentrinker was convicted of dangerous driving for a 2019 incident in front of his daughter’s preschool when a judge says he aimed his Mercedes at a pedestrian, Peter Bullen. Bullen says he was trying to photograph Bronfentrinker’s car that was over a double yellow line, when the event occurred.

[RollOnFriday describes](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/willkie-partner-rebuked-after-aiming-merc-pedestrian) what happened:

Bronfentrinker, who was then a partner at Quinn Emanuel, told the jury he was attempting to drive around Bullen, and had only been travelling at two or three miles an hour. But the judge said he aimed at the man “to scare him”.

Following Bronfentrinker’s conviction, Judge Bartle said, “You did not, as you claimed”, veer away from Bullen “immediately” or “after a short period forward go immediately into the road”.

“He was standing in front of your car and you drove your car at him, and he would not have known what you intended to do. I’m sure he was scared by what you did”,

The judge concluded that Bronfentrinker did not intend to run Bullen down or injure him, although “he would not have known that”, reported the Mirror.

For the conviction, he was fined £5,000 and barred from driving for a year.

The SRA, which administers the code of conduct for lawyers in the U.K., found Bronfentrinker “failed to behave in a way that maintains the trust the public” in breach of the SRA Principles. He was assessed £420 to cover the SRA’s investigation costs.

Willkie Farr has not commented on the rebuke.

# Another Biglaw Firm To Implement Salary Cuts Due To COVID-19
## Am Law 200 austerity cuts never really end.

It seemed it was relatively quiet on the Biglaw COVID-19 austerity measures front for the last week or so. But it turns out at least one firm was busy making announcements about their cuts.

The latest firm to enact cost-cutting measures in the wake of COVID-19 is Stroock, Stroock, and Lavan. The firm, which made $258,000,000 gross revenue in 2019 making it [122nd on the Am Law 200](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=296&name=Stroock), announced last week that they were slashing salaries.

So, what’s exactly going on at Stroock? Effective June 1, monthly draws for equity partners will be reduced by 20 percent and monthly draws for contract partners will be reduced by 15 percent. All non-partner lawyers will see a salary cut of 15 percent, and staff making $75,000+ will also see a 15 percent cut.

But there is good news for busy associates — they’ll have the opportunity to make back that cut with their billable hours:

However, those attorneys annualizing at 1,800 or more client billable hours on any of June 30, September 30 or December 31 will have any prior compensation reductions repaid within thirty days after the applicable quarter-end date.

One note a tipster had about the firm’s austerity plans (which also applies to partners at other firms deferring or cutting partner draws):

Will be interesting to see what PPP is like at all of these firms come year end.  Cutting partner draws is not the same thing as cutting partner pay.  If PPP doesn’t drop at least 15%-20% when all is said and done, then it will become clear that these salary cuts are just a cash grab to cushion the blow for highly paid partners at the expense of associates and staff.

A firm spokesperson provided the following statement about the cuts:

Like many of our peer firms have already done over the last three months, Stroock is now implementing certain reductions for staff and attorneys due to the global recession resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. We are grateful that we have been able to forgo this action for 12 weeks and have fully paid all employees, even those who have been unable to perform their duties remotely over the past three months.
We hope that these measures will be temporary in nature. At this juncture, we deemed it prudent to take certain measures to insulate the firm and its workforce from the economic havoc caused by the pandemic. While salary reductions are never ideal, we prefer to be proactive in light of unprecedented economic challenges in the industry and across the globe.
We are also mindful that some associates are busy and we have taken care that they will be “made whole” via recurring hours reviews and restored compensation on an ongoing basis. In addition, we have let staff and attorneys know that, subject to firm needs, we are open to reduced schedules for individuals who voluntarily elect to go that route.
Stroock also introduced a generous buyout program for employees who may wish to retire early or who may not wish to return to the office when remote work concludes.
We believe that the measures we have introduced are fair, and we have used the preceding three months to take a mindful approach to ways in which we can responsibly navigate the current economic challenges.

Subject: COVID-19 Announcement

 

Stroock is a special place. We have a strong culture made up of intelligent and caring people who are committed to our collective success. Remaining strong in times of human and economic crisis is critical to our primary job as stewards of the firm – one that takes into account the needs and interests of our attorneys, staff and clients. At the outset of the pandemic, we took immediate steps to keep people safe, reduce expenses and rationalize operations, and continue to deliver outstanding legal service. However, we are not immune from the effects of the continued economic disruption to our clients and the broader economy.

 

As a result, we have made the difficult decision to further reduce expenses in order to ensure that we are better able to navigate an uncertain future. Being proactive is prudent, but not easy. Our decision was made with the best interest of the collective in mind and on the basis that each part of the firm would share in the temporary sacrifices that will allow us to better manage the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 crisis.

 

Effective June 1, 2020, the following changes will be put in place for the balance of the year. We will assess developments at year-end to see if any steps taken should be re-evaluated.

 

- Monthly draws for equity partners will be reduced by 20% and monthly draws for contract partners will be reduced by 15%. The June partner tax draw will also be reduced by 20% and, consistent with current IRS filing guidelines, the April and June partner tax draws will be paid in July.
 

- Base compensation for all non-partner lawyers will be reduced by 15%. However, those attorneys annualizing at 1,800 or more client billable hours on any of June 30, September 30 or December 31 will have any prior compensation reductions repaid within thirty days after the applicable quarter-end date.
 

- Base compensation for all staff will be reduced by 15%. Raises and promotions for staff will be frozen.
 

- The above 15% reductions will not apply to any employee whose full-time salary is $75,000 or below (and we will ensure that any reduction will not result in a full-time salary going below that level).
 

Discretionary year-end bonuses will continue to be awarded based on current eligibility criteria. Performance reviews will continue in the ordinary course.

 

We recognize that people have been affected by the pandemic in different ways, and some may want to explore alternative work arrangements. Accordingly, we are willing to discuss voluntary buyouts or reductions in workload for staff, and reductions in workload for lawyers, dependent of course on the needs of our practice groups and the firm generally.

 

Please know that we will make it through this crisis and that Stroock will emerge poised to continue its growth trajectory and ready to handle new challenges, just as it has for the last 144 years. Know also that we are available to discuss any of your concerns and questions. We appreciate your continued understanding as we navigate these unprecedented times.

 

— The Executive Committee

# What's The Best City For Lawyers?
## Get ready to move to... Birmingham, I guess.

It’s always a fun thought experiment to imagine that there’s some better city for lawyers than New York. Sure, there may be [more purchase power](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/) in other cities and some parts of the country don’t vacillate sharply between oppressively hot and will-sappingly cold, but if you’re looking to build a long-term career at the highest levels, New York is the best market for that.

But it’s still possible to be the biggest fish in a smaller pond and it might be a tad more comfortable too. If you wanted comfort, then you probably shouldn’t have become a lawyer, but here we are.

[AdvisorSmith](https://advisorsmith.com) has a new list of [the best cities to go a-lawyerin’ in](https://advisorsmith.com/data/best-cities-for-lawyers/) and the methodology makes a good deal of sense, ranking cities based on a) the cost of living index for each city, (b) the average annual salaries for lawyers in the city, and (c) the density of jobs for lawyers in each city.

So what did they find?

The #1 city for lawyers is our nation’s capital, Washington D.C., which has the highest concentration of jobs for lawyers of any city in our study, with over 3 times the national average. The city also offers average salaries for lawyers of $179,980, which is 25% above the national average.

Well good for Washington. It’s not a secret that we’ve long thought D.C. lawyers are a bit [soft](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/why-are-d-c-lawyers-such-frigging-babies/), but maybe it’s because they’ve been coddled by the city where they practice being such a delightful cesspool. Houston checks in at second, which makes some sense as a booming market in a relatively low-cost city.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
The best cities for lawyers are large cities, with 9 of the top 10, and 38 of the top 50 cities being cities with populations of 500,000 or higher. Major cities have higher concentrations of businesses and organizations in need of legal assistance, creating more opportunities for attorneys and their careers.

That tracks. It’s actually astounding that big cities don’t make up the whole top ten. The lone outlier in the top ten of this survey is Tallahassee, which clocks in at 3. Apparently, the best way to get on this list without being in a major city is to be in a state capital, which makes some sense because lobbying is a thing, but living if Floribama is really one of the top three cities to be a lawyer in, then it’s time to find a new profession.

You can [check out all the numbers here](https://advisorsmith.com/data/best-cities-for-lawyers/), but for ready reference, here are the top 10 cities:

1 Washington, DC
2 Houston, TX
3 Tallahassee, FL
4 Chicago, IL
5 Miami, FL
6 Birmingham, AL
7 Philadelphia, PA
8 Atlanta, GA
9 Pittsburgh, PA
10 Richmond, VA

New York is apparently 11th. When you consider the role cost of living plays in this survey, that’s actually quite impressive.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 07.25.16
## * If Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump wins the election, he may be the first president-elect to be standing trial for fraud prior to taking the oath of office. Judge Gonzalo Curiel has tentatively refused to dismiss one of the two pending Trump University cases, saying plaintiffs had met requirements for the case to move forward for a jury to decide whether Trump ""participated in a scheme to defraud"" students. [[San Diego Union-Tribune](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/jul/22/judge-not-dismissing-trump-university-lawsuit/)] * After being served with a class-action suit alleging she rigged the Democratic primaries and the release of emails in the latest Guccifer hack showing her favoritism for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz is resigning as the Democratic National Committee's chair after this week's convention. [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/22/politics/dnc-wikileaks-emails/); [Observer](http://observer.com/2016/06/debbie-wasserman-schultz-served-class-action-lawsuit-for-rigging-primaries/#.V5O4ezD1zQM.facebook)] * Five senators, including Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Cory Booker (D-NJ), have introduced the Student Loan Tax Relief Act, which would exempt forgiven loans from being taxed as income. Law school grads on IBR, ICR, or PAYE should pray this bill is passed. [[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2016/07/22/no-more-gotcha-bill-would-exempt-student-loan-forgiveness-from-tax/#3de342592cc7)] * In an announcement made before markets opened, Verizon said it would be purchasing Yahoo for $4.83B. It's rumored that Faiza Saeed, Cravath's incoming presiding partner -- who was appointed to a committee to explore Yahoo's sale -- was the driving force behind the deal, which is expected to close in early 2017. [[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-m-a-verizon-idUSKCN1040U9); [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/is-cravaths-new-leader-behind-verizon-and-yahoos-reported-talks/)] * Law firms are apparently in a ""weak spot"" when it comes to the detection of money laundering operations. That may be how Shearman & Sterling got mixed up with an alleged Malaysian plot to siphon funds from its trust account to purchase luxury items in a scheme that's turned into an attempted $1B DOJ asset forfeiture.

* Five senators, including Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Cory Booker (D-NJ), have introduced the Student Loan Tax Relief Act, which would exempt forgiven loans from being taxed as income. Law school grads on IBR, ICR, or PAYE should pray this bill is passed. [[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2016/07/22/no-more-gotcha-bill-would-exempt-student-loan-forgiveness-from-tax/#3de342592cc7)]

* In an announcement made before markets opened, Verizon said it would be purchasing Yahoo for $4.83B. It’s rumored that Faiza Saeed, Cravath’s incoming presiding partner — who was appointed to a committee to explore Yahoo’s sale — was the driving force behind the deal, which is expected to close in early 2017. [[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-m-a-verizon-idUSKCN1040U9); [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/is-cravaths-new-leader-behind-verizon-and-yahoos-reported-talks/)]

* Law firms are apparently in a “weak spot” when it comes to the detection of money laundering operations. That may be how Shearman & Sterling got mixed up with an alleged Malaysian plot to siphon funds from its trust account to purchase luxury items in a scheme that’s turned into an attempted $1B DOJ asset forfeiture.

# Prove You’re A (Good) Lawyer! The Double Whammy of Being A Minority Lady Lawyer
## The game is rigged, and it’s pretty clear against whom it is rigged. And minority women know the score.

We’re back again.   This time, based on popular demand, we are back to discuss the unique challenges that women of color face in the legal profession.  And by challenges we mean the double-whammy of racial and gender bias.

Let’s start with the [National Association for Law Placement (NALP) 2018 report](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/2018NALPReportonDiversityinUSLawFirms_FINAL.pdf) on diversity in U.S. law firms to line up some depressing figures:

- 51.42 percent of summer associates are women; 45.91 percent of associates are women; and only 23.36 percent of partners are women.
- 35.04 percent of summer associates are racial/ethnic minorities; 24.22 percent of associates are racial/ethnic minorities; and only 9.13 percent of partners are racial/ethnic minorities.
- 20.83 percent of summer associates are minority women; 13.52 percent of associates are minority women; and only 3.19 percent of partners.
“[A]t just 3.19 percent of partners in 2018, minority women continue to be the most dramatically underrepresented group at the partnership level, a pattern that holds across all firm sizes and most jurisdictions.”

It is no wonder that minority women face higher barriers.  They are not seen in the profession.  The barriers to entry set up a self-fulfilling prophecy and a false meritocracy.  Minority women can’t get their foot in the door.  And even if they do, someone is going to slam that door against them (maybe even repeatedly).

To borrow from our [last co-written column](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/obsess-about-the-dress-suit/): “The reason that women don’t seem to ‘conform’ to what a lawyer ‘looks like’ is because the stereotype of a lawyer is a man.”  We should have added the term “white” to the term “man.”

A recent ABA Report “[You Can’t Change What You Can’t See](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/women/you-cant-change-what-you-cant-see-print.pdf): Interrupting Racial and Gender Bias In the Legal Profession,” discusses some of the barriers minority women face to a greater degree than any other group.  To get the same recognition as their white male peers, minority men and women and white women “reported that they have to go ‘above and beyond’ to get the same recognition and respect as their colleagues.”   Minority women are more likely to be mistaken for janitors “at a level 50 percentage points higher than white men.”  Women of all races reported doing more administrative tasks than their male colleagues.  Gender and race also appear to affect the type and quality of work lawyers receive, depriving minority women of opportunities to interact with clients and develop practical skills (and meet their required billable hours).

These experiences confirm what the data suggests:  Substantial barriers prevent minority women from garnering top slots in the legal profession.  We’d call it a glass ceiling, but there is more than one barrier and those barriers are hardly invisible.

Part of the problem is the perception of what needs to change in the legal profession to deal with these barriers.  Not surprisingly, the typical answers require the minority lady lawyer to either change herself or to bear the burden of effectuating actual change.  For example, “[t]he most commonly used training materials and leadership courses focused on how individual lawyers could overcome barriers in the workplace . . . rather than on removing those barriers,” writes the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/us/lawyers-bias-racial-gender.html).  And when it comes to removing those barriers, [another ABA study notes](mailto:https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/marketing/women/visibleinvisibility.authcheckdam.pdf) that “many firms overburden women of color through diversity committee assignments, recruiting assignments and other such efforts that marginalize the diversity efforts and place women of color in conflicting roles that compete for limited time.”

To a minority lady lawyer candidate, the whole process might sound like this: Please prove to us that you are worthy of employment by overcoming these barriers.  We definitely won’t change them and might exacerbate them by relying significantly on referrals and hiring pools lacking diversity.  Once you do overcome them, well, you might have to work twice as hard to get exactly where your white male peer stands.  We will reward that with lower pay, but we’re still going to question whether you really do belong by asking you to prove it again.  Then you get to encounter [biased performance evaluations](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/women/Updated%20Bias%20Interrupters.pdf) with vague criteria where you will need to defend yourself against unsupported critiques.  And once you do all that, we can claim that we aren’t biased because, look, you’re here!

It’s a neat trick.  Except:  Minority women aren’t in the legal profession, to any great degree.  And that’s largely because of the double whammy they suffer of racism and sexism.  And double whammy isn’t accurate because the negative effects of race and gender don’t just add up.  The effects of intersectionality are often compounded.  There’s a reason minority lady lawyers are even harder to find than just lady lawyers or minority lawyers alone.

It might be convenient to just blame the firms for this problem.  Sure, they have barriers that need to change, even those firms that acknowledge these issues exist.  For example, firms that have diversity programs might treat those associates as tokens, stigmatizing them and constantly reminding others that the associate is “different” and was hired through a different process.

But other institutions also have a way of entrenching the familiar, no matter how sexist and racist. It’s not like law schools have been great about assuring diversity of the legal profession by accepting droves of minority women.   The barriers facing minority women before they even take the LSAT, combined with the law school singular quest to assure U.S. News Rankings, combines to block all but a small number of minority women from entering law schools.  Institutional bias trickles down, and flows upward.  [The game is rigged](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3339527), and it’s pretty clear against whom it is rigged. And minority women know the score.  All they have to do is look at the [faculty bios](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/your-law-schools-predominantly-white-male-faculty-profile-pics/), law firm bios, and notice who isn’t there to any great degree.  As the ABA’s most recent report on this issue notes [in its title](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/women/Updated%20Bias%20Interrupters.pdf), “You can’t change what you can’t see.”  Until we start seeing more minority women in law schools (as students and professors), as summer associates, as associates, and as partners, it will be difficult to change what we frequently fail to see:  Time and time again minority women have to prove their worth when their peers get by on the same — or worse — credentials.  And every time they are asked to prove their worth again, minority women have to fight harder to stay in a profession that should value their voices.

# Quinn Emanuel Filed A Complaint To Save An Artist's Life... Sadly, It Came Too Late
## Star art world litigator Luke Nikas filed suit to protect an elderly artist. Now the fight is over Indiana's legacy.

Most of us don’t know the name Robert Indiana. Yet, the artist looms in every American’s subconscious like the proverbial splinter in their mind. Robert Indiana was an artist, the man behind the “Love” image that famously appears throughout the country. He also produced a wealth of art beyond that image — so much so that the Whitney put on a show of his works in 2013 titled “Robert Indiana: Beyond Love.”

Robert Indiana died last week. [Quinn Emanuel](https://www.quinnemanuel.com) partner [Luke Nikas](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/nikas-luke/) is litigating over his legacy.

Nikas, who lateraled to Quinn from Boies Schiller in December, filed this lawsuit on behalf of Indiana’s long-time patrons a week ago Friday. They hoped to win a case freeing Indiana from opportunists they claim sheltered the artist from outsiders and used his name to produce forgeries and approve licenses to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. After Nikas filed the complaint, the defendants branded the charges as preposterous and proclaimed that Indiana was in fine health and “[quite sharp](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-art-robertindiana-lawsuit/legacy-of-love-artist-robert-indiana-is-subject-of-new-lawsuit-idUSKCN1IJ2Q9).”

They admitted he was already dead days later.

The story that the complaint tells — while tragically incomplete, written as it was before knowing of Indiana’s passing — paints a sad picture of the end of an artist’s life. Indiana, as the complaint explains, fell out of the art world after producing one of the most iconic images of the latter half of the 20th century, until Morgan Art Foundation Limited and its advisor, Simon Salama-Caro, reached out to Indiana in the 1990s with a plan to bring him back into the mainstream.

Indiana’s work enjoyed a renaissance after that, culminating in the Whitney exhibit. Unfortunately, the complaint alleges, Indiana’s reclusive lifestyle and his rediscovered success drew outsiders eager to capitalize on his renewed fame.

The complaint says:

But Robert Indiana’s health has deteriorated. He can no longer create art or manage his financial affairs. And this decline has enabled something sinister to occur. On May 7, 2016, Indiana signed a power of attorney appointing Jamie L. Thomas, who is a fisherman from Maine with no art expertise that Indiana had employed to run errands and do work around the house. He was not a friend or acquaintance of Morgan Art Foundation, Salama-Caro, or others who have helped revive and protect Indiana’s financial well-being and reputation for the past two decades. Instead, Thomas has deliberately isolated Indiana from Morgan Art Foundation, the Salama-Caro family, and Indiana’s other long-time friends and supporters. He controls and intercepts Indiana’s emails and telephone calls. He refuses to permit visitors to Indiana’s home. He writes aggressive and threatening emails from Indiana’s email account—including an email sent to Marc Salama-Caro shortly after Marc visited Indiana at Indiana’s request, telling Marc to “FUCK OFF” and to never return to Vinalhaven.

According to the complaint, this fisherman worked with another art company to produce forgeries and collect on unauthorized licenses while Indiana’s health declined. Tragically, the complaint came too late, but the fight to protect Indiana’s legacy going forward will go on.

The complaint paints a picture that is both disturbing and all too familiar. We’re not long separated from the surprise publication of Harper Lee’s “[Go Set A Watchman](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/standard-of-review-go-set-go-set-a-watchman-on-your-shelf-and-never-read-it-again/),” a work that got literary world observers talking about elder abuse. The official inquiry in that case turned up no evidence of abuse, but many still wonder if Lee would have dropped off her “Atticus Finch Is Now A Racist” manuscript without encouragement from people who stood to benefit from the old woman’s estate.

Those are the concerns that brought Morgan Art to Luke Nikas for help.

Nikas, who despite his youth is recognized as an international leader in the world of art litigation, is a poster child for the argument that no one can predict how their legal career will shape up. A star at Boies Schiller, Nikas started representing the Warhol Foundation in a 2014 matter involving the theft of an [Elizabeth Taylor portrait by a former Warhol bodyguard](https://www.bsfllp.com/news-events/warhol-foundation-sues-bodyguard-over-liz-taylor-painting.html). Nikas never set out to be an art world attorney, but sometimes fate opens doors. His representation of the Warhol Foundation continued, including the high-profile case [over a Prince photograph turned portrait](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/warhol-foundation-strikes-first-photographer-complains-copyright-922025). His Warhol work led to representing [Ann Freedman in the matter of a forged Rothko](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/arts/design/knoedler-gallery-director-settles-lawsuit-over-fake-rothko.html) and [the Tisch family over a stolen Picasso](https://news.artnet.com/market/hendel-tisch-picasso-lawsuit-478832). The next thing Nikas knew, he was the sort of guy who [helps found an arbitration tribunal in The Hague](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/court-arbitration-art-1281932) dedicated to resolving art disputes at a fraction of the cost.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
How does something like this happen? Nikas told me that what the art world fundamentally needs are generalists. There’s a good deal of litigation and a good deal of transactional work — but what the players in this world want are top-notch attorneys willing to represent them more than someone who took three art law classes in law school.

One of the earliest lessons a lawyer learns is that they can control what they don’t do, but not necessarily what they will do. Few people walk into law with a passion for bankruptcy… they’re just litigators hoping to get court time faster and then four years later realize they’re experts in the Code. Early in my career, I had the good fortune to work with Peter Herbert, a former SDNY prosecutor who never sought out the life of an entertainment lawyer, but found himself taking a sleigh ride through New Jersey with Bruce Springsteen at 2 in the morning because he’d happened to win a precedent-setting entertainment case while working as a general commercial litigator… and it begat a career. Just like [becoming an entertainment lawyer](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/2015/05/network-law-on-television/), the key to being a good art lawyer has a lot more to do with being “good” than coming into it with a mastery of art history.

Nikas is following a similar path. As a partner with Boies Schiller, Nikas relished his career as a high-stakes commercial litigator. But when his work with prominent art world figures kept leading to more “one-off” cases, he realized he had a unique book of business that didn’t match Boies Schiller’s fundamental business plan built around core, institutional clients. Quinn Emanuel, on the other hand, affords partners more freedom to pursue their passions. It’s the same quality that [attracted Alex Spiro](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/quinn-emanuel-pulls-off-coup-with-big-time-criminal-defense-hire/) too. The firm culture at Quinn Emanuel is custom-built for young hotshots seeking some extra breathing room to pursue niche practices.

What kept drawing Luke Nikas to his art practice, and to litigation generally, is the opportunity to tell stories. With the Robert Indiana complaint, Nikas provides a sad and compelling story of an elderly artist’s final days and one that he’s eager to flesh out through discovery. His adversaries have already set up an interesting deposition by telling the media that Indiana was in fine health and then immediately revealing that he’d died.

Perhaps the most tragic question Nikas will have to ask is if Indiana really died only last week?

# Hiring Freezes And Stealth Layoffs Hit Top 50 Biglaw Firms
## Yikes! Sorry, but the party's over....

Aspiring Biglaw lawyers: left out of the cold?

Earlier this week, we discussed the legal sector’s [loss of nearly 9,000 jobs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/legal-sector-loses-almost-9k-jobs-in-august-but-is-rightsizing-to-blame/) in August. At the time, we wondered if law firm rightsizing could possibly be to blame. On top of that, legal recruiters are saying that “demand for associates no longer exceeds supply,” and that the frenzied hiring we saw last year is [simply no more](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/want-a-big-signing-bonus-with-your-biglaw-lateral-move-not-in-this-economy/) thanks to a slowdown in work. Now, news of law firm hiring freezes and stealth layoffs at top Biglaw firms has come to light, and we’re no longer wondering.

According to a report from the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/09/08/hiring-pauses-stealth-layoffs-at-top-50-law-firms-signal-industry-austerity/), numerous firms in the Am Law top 50 have implemented austerity measures when it comes to controlling their attorney headcounts. Here are the details:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Cooley has implemented a freeze on hiring associates, sources close to the firm have told The American Lawyer. Leaders at Cooley declined to comment for this story, but a spokesperson denied the existence of an “official hiring freeze” at the firm. …

Meanwhile, sources close to Reed Smith said the global law firm is dealing with profitability gaps between its London office and lower-performing locations, including its oldest office in Pittsburgh, leading the firm to let go of more senior lawyers without significant books.

While Cooley didn’t offer much of a statement other than to deny that an “official hiring freeze” was in effect (something we haven’t heard of from Biglaw in more than a decade), a spokesperson for Reed Smith offered the following: “We continually evaluate all aspects of our business in order to best support our clients and ensure the continued strength of the firm. In the normal course of our business, we routinely make personnel decisions. These decisions are consistent with personnel actions we have taken in the past as we prudently manage our business.” As many of our dedicated readers know, talk like this really smacks of stealth layoffs.

Stealth layoffs are the disturbingly popular method used by Biglaw firms to cull the associate (and partner) herd. For those who might be hearing the term for the first time, stealth layoffs allow firms to cut headcount without confirming that there were any financially based layoffs. Firm frequently couch the reductions in performance review terms that coincidentally happen in the midst of a downturn — whether economic- or demand-related — often making those let go doubt their lawyering skills. By their secretive nature, they can be challenging to confirm in specific numbers, but insiders slowly find out something is amiss.

Now that the cat is out of the bag and we know that firms are trying to manage their attorney ranks, we think we’ll be seeing many more of these stealth layoffs as firms desperately try to avoid the incredibly negative publicity that goes hand in hand with outright layoffs.

# Attorneys Are Reacting To Email From Biglaw Chair About His Summer Vacation
## Some associates are mad about it, but it's actually great to see.

The summer’s almost over, and despite the less than ideal weather experienced across the country, it is generally a time for vacations and relaxation — two things that aren’t the most common in Biglaw. But it’s good news when attorneys can participate in the annual tradition.

Everyone at Crowell & Moring received an email this morning from chair Philip Inglima (available in full on t[he next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/crowell-vacation/2/)) about his summer vacation. What may seem like bragging actually reads like a gentle reminder that everyone needs vacations. He writes that because of the teamwork at the firm he was able to get away for two weeks:

[T]he world (somehow) kept turning. I know, that’s hard to believe, but Crowell and the rest of the cosmos remained in balance, without me. That’s because everything we do here is a team effort, and it works best that way. So I leaned on lots of other colleagues to make it possible for me to really pull away. (And I send thanks again to all of you who carry me – both when I’m around, and when I’m not!)

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And that getting away is essential for mental health:

I needed it. We all pride ourselves on being able to “power through” the pressures and demands of our work; in our business, that’s become almost a badge of honor. But taking the time to refresh, recharge, and refocus is essential to our well-being, and helpful to our professional effectiveness. I came back from my break with a lot of work awaiting me, but also with a level of energy and enthusiasm that was waning in the days before I left. And as the fall season approaches, and with it the increased work that always seems to coincide with the “back-to-school” period in September, I’m glad to have my tank refilled.

Inglima means truly getting away too — not just sitting in a beautiful location while still doing your job, “We’re lucky to be part of a generous community, with colleagues who really want to make it possible for us to unplug. Whether the break is for two weeks, one week, or even less, the key is pulling away, with others covering your duties so you truly can be ‘away.'”

Which is a lovely sentiment. But not everyone is pleased. Above the Law received intel from tipsters at the firm practically seething with rage about the “clueless email,” that was “crowing about his lovely and relaxing 2-week vacation to the entire firm, where most lawyers don’t have such a luxury.” With some writing, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite like this in my long legal career.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
But is Inglima really that out of touch?

I am sympathetic to the tipster’s anger. It’s tough when you’re in the weeds, on a case or a deal that is taking up all your time and the thought of taking two weeks off seems preposterous. And even if you could get away you feel you’d just be slammed when you get back anyway so it’s not worth it. But the only way that harmful attitude changes is by seeing emails like this from the top. The firm administration is demonstrating that mental health and well being is a priority.

The way that junior partners internalize the message that taking a break is important is by seeing firm leaders do it — walking the walk, not just talking the talk. And the way senior associates see that vacation is possible is by watching partners do it. And junior associates get the message about what is acceptable by mimicking the older associates. It all rolls downhill. If you want the culture of a firm to change, senior leadership must buy in.

Inglima is showing there’s a better way to Biglaw. We can only hope more firms have this well-balanced attitude when it comes to vacations.

And take that vacation — you really do deserve it.

* Disbarred defense attorney F. Lee Bailey — who you may remember as being part of O.J. Simpson’s “dream team” — filed for bankruptcy in an attempt to escape $5M+ of debt owed to the IRS. He says the IRS previously turned down his settlement offers because he’s “a celebrity, and it would look bad for them.” [[Portland Press Herald](http://www.pressherald.com/2016/06/24/disbarred-attorney-f-lee-bailey-files-for-bankruptcy-in-maine-federal-court/)]

# Early Adopters Of The Associate Raises Continue To Make Moves
## What to do about Simpson Thacher (via special bonuses) and Cravath (via bumps for senior associates) beating them at their own game?

Every associate — and there are a tons of you out there — that’s about to receive a raise or special bonus owes a debt of gratitude to the powers that be at [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/), as well as the early adopters of the new associate compensation scale. They were instrumental in getting firms to consider upping the base salaries and creating the momentum for change.

Unfortunately (for them), the raises they first announced are no longer at the top of the compensation heap. So, what’s a firm that’s trying to be an industry leader to do?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Well, we have updates from three different early movers trying to figure out what to do about [Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/) (via special bonuses) and [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) (via bumps for senior associates) beating them at their own game.

First up: Milbank. The firm announced today they were meeting the increased Cravath scale PLUS they are giving all associates in good standing special summer bonuses in accordance with the prevailing market rate (ranging from $5,000 – $25,000, depending on seniority).

Next up are two boutiques that were quick to match the now outdated Milbank scale. Both [Selendy & Gay](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/selendy-gay-raise-associate-salaries-and-i-cant-wait-for-the-quinn-emanuel-response/) and [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-first-firm-has-matched-the-new-milbank-scale/) have announced they are meeting the more generous Cravath scale. No word (so far) about special bonuses.

The demise of Toys R Us, the retailer that fueled our childhoods, is a complex and sad tale. It was never as simple as getting crushed by Amazon’s online sales as some suggest. Certainly failing to build an online empire of its own while Amazon prepared to eat Geoffrey the Giraffe’s lunch didn’t help, but neither did a [string of private equity owners](https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/15/news/companies/toys-r-us-closing-blame/index.html) who treated the store as their private capital loss.

It turns out the “R” in the name was as backward as the business model.

Speaking of private equity, it shouldn’t shock you to learn that Toys R Us was in deep with Kirkland & Ellis — the megafirm that’s fueled its meteoric rise to the top of the Am Law 100 [by becoming the go-to private equity shop](https://www.ft.com/content/13696928-86d5-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2) in the world.

In a sense, Kirkland is the last one to pick up something cool from Toys R Us, in this case $56 million for a little over a year of work. Not a bad haul, but [not as cool as Omega Supreme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrwHldNDK-s).

Now that the firm has some cold hard cash lying around, perhaps Kirkland will [join Gunderson in offering some summer bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/gunderson-announces-summer-bonuses-your-move-am-law-100/).

# Law School Has Failed The Profession
## Too many Biglaw lawyers are financially illiterate -- putting their practices and firms at risk.

I had a mildly terrifying experience a few months back. I attended a seminar on law firm leadership. The audience was primarily composed of the managing partners of large national and regional law firms. During the presentation, the speaker discussed the need for law firm managers to take a hard look at their firms’ income statements as the economy starts to tighten up.

Across the room, the managing partner of a major firm put up their hand. This individual, who shall remain nameless, is in charge of a $100 million+ enterprise and is personally responsible for the professional well-being of hundreds of people. They asked the speaker, “Can you define ‘income statement?’”

Look, I try to believe that there aren’t any bad questions. I champion [intellectual humility](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/getting-it-right-when-we-get-it-wrong/). I believe strongly in identifying what we don’t know and doing our best to educate ourselves, gracefully and gratefully. But come on — seriously? This is not an acceptable gap in a managing partner’s knowledge base.

Ignorance Fuels Biglaw’s Broken Business Model

Unfortunately, I would wager that the brave soul who raised their hand and cured their ignorance that day wasn’t the only person in that room with that same question on their minds. Far too many people in law firm management don’t have the training to even understand the categories on their balance sheet without resorting to Google. That should not happen in a firm with $100,000 in annual revenue, much less one with $100,000,000.

This lack of basic financial literacy has been holding back the management and growth of the legal industry for decades. Many large law firms are only now starting to adopt the financial analytics tools that have long been commonplace in the broader business world.

Plenty of national firms are still struggling with the basic concept that [big revenue does not necessarily equal profits](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/sedgwick-death-by-billable-hours/). At those firms, a partner’s compensation is still entirely pegged to the revenue they generate, without sufficient — or any — consideration of the overhead it takes to bring that revenue in the door. This creates fundamentally bad incentives. In that kind of system, it makes sense for a partner to spend $1,000 of the firm’s money to bring in $500 of new business. The expense gets split among the entire partnership, but the benefits of that new business are concentrated in the originating partner. This “sell it at a loss, but make it up in volume” mentality is a dangerous business practice, but it’s still a dominant strategy at too many law firms across the country.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This isn’t just a concern for law firm management; it’s a concern for competently representing our clients. Our clients pay us to be their experts on call. If we can’t even speak the same language, how can we effectively counsel them on their business decisions? This problem isn’t limited to the world of private practice. Attorneys working in the public sector, like prosecutors, public defenders, legal activists, and the like, all will likely need to review and understand financial documents at some point in their careers. Deficiencies in basic business competence impact every attorney practicing law.

The source of this financial illiteracy certainly isn’t that lawyers lack the intelligence to understand business finance. Some attorneys joke that the legal profession is made up of people whose math scores weren’t good enough to get into medical school, but in reality we’re mostly pretty sharp people.

Law Schools Have Let Us Down, But We Can Fix It

The problem is one of training. Most of us didn’t get any formal training on business, accounting, or finance at any point in our careers. Law schools don’t generally require business classes, since it’s assumed we’ll learn the business side of the practice on the job, if we even end up in private practice to begin with.

By the time we get out of academia and into our first years as attorneys, however, most of us spend so much time just trying to stay above water that there’s no time, or incentive, to dig down and learn the finer points of [P&L statements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plstatement.asp), [accrual vs. cash basis accounting](https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/cash-basis-vs-accrual-basis-accounting.html), or what [a cash-flow statement](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/what-is-a-cash-flow-statement/) is. We tend to just pick up what we have to, when we have to, and muddle along on a piecemeal basis until we need to learn some new tidbit to muddle a little further.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
For those of us already out in the wilds of practice, there are resources available to start getting caught up to speed. I’ve taken courses through [Harvard Business School Online](https://online.hbs.edu/), read as many business books as I can get my hands on, and am contemplating signing up for an executive MBA program. I’m not doing this because I need a new hobby or out of any need or desire to spruce up my résumé; I’m doing this because if I wasn’t, I think I’d be failing at my job.

On a more global level, I think law schools need to look at incorporating mandatory business finance training into their curricula. Most business schools have a required law course; why shouldn’t we return the favor? Especially given how widespread the belief is that [the final year of law school is a waste of time](https://www.businessinsider.com/whats-wrong-with-the-third-year-of-law-school-2013-8). Every law student would likely benefit from a comprehensive introduction to the concepts that underlie every private organization in the world. And by forcing our incoming classes of attorneys to step up to a higher level of financial knowledge, we increase the literacy and competence of the profession as a whole.

Goodbye, Easy Street

Law firms had it easy for decades. We made enough money that we could afford to be sloppy with our business practices. Those days are long gone, and most firms have already tightened their belts as much as they reasonably can. Law firms need to remain lean, efficient, and intelligent to survive in the new economy, something that’s impossible to do if we can’t even read our own accounting statements. We owe it to our clients, our firms, and ourselves, to do better.

# Federal Judge Demands Resignation Of 'Eat A Bowl Of Dicks' Lawyer

For the maybe two people in the legal world that somehow missed the exploits of [Christopher Hook](http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Licensee/Detail/255080), a plaintiffs’ lawyer in California, let me catch you up. Hook is squaring off against a legal team at Sheppard Mullin, led by partner [Peter Klee,](https://www.sheppardmullin.com/pklee) in an insurance dispute over about $200,000. But Hook’s bold language in settlement negotiations made him an Above the Law star. Hook’s bon mots include “eat a bowl of dicks,” “let the long dick of the law f*ck [your client],” “cumstain,” and  “limp dick mother f*cker.” From Klee’s declaration in support of a motion for sanctions:

Now that we’ve got that fun refresher done, we can focus on the latest development. Yesterday there was a hearing in the case, and U.S. District Judge Otis Wright II of the Central District of California told Hook bluntly, “You just trashed your profession.” He went on to demand Hook resign from the profession, [as reported by](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2019/12/16/judge-demands-resignation-of-lawyer-who-wrote-profanity-laced-emails/) Law.com:

Wright, a former deputy sheriff in Los Angeles County and a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, told Hook he had acted “like a gangster.”

“Tell you what, slick, this profession does not need you,” the judge said. “I am going to do what I can to remove you from this profession.”

He then asked Hook to resign.

“I will not do that,” Hook responded, prompting Wright to interject.

“Shut up,” the judge said. “I want you to resign from this profession.”

Judge Wright also took issue with Hook’s assertion that his emails were protected by the First Amendment and the litigation privilege:

“You honestly believe the First Amendment extends to anything?” Wright replied. “You did go to law school, right?”

As you might imagine, Wright ordered Hook to pay fees and costs:

At the end of the hearing, the judge told Sheppard Mullin’s lawyers to submit the fees and costs they want from Hook. Hook said he would agree to pay them.

“You’re going to pay for this,” the judge told Hook. “You’re going to write a check. That’s just the first thing. This is not going to be over.”

As he left the courtroom, Hook reportedly apologized for his actions, but it just might be too little too late.

# Stat Of The Week: Big Cos. Win On Billables
## Smaller rivals, not so much.

The world’s biggest companies successfully pushed back on Biglaw billing rates in 2020, but law firms still came out ahead by upping the tab for smaller clients, according to a new report. 

[Thomson Reuters’ 2021 Legal Department Operations Index](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/reports/legal-department-operations-index-sixth-edition-2021) reveals growing scrutiny of legal bills, with “controlling outside counsel costs” identified as the top priority by corporate law departments. 

The companies with the most buying power even moved the needle — those with annual revenue over $10 billion saw rate decreases across the board in 2020. But their smaller competitors were left holding the bag, as overall law firm rates generally rose. 

The largest companies “significantly pressured rates in 2020 and realized decreases across all timekeeper types,” the report said. “In fact, this is the first report in which we saw decreases of this magnitude.”

“Perhaps in response, law firms overall were able to generally increase rates and realize significantly greater year-over-year increases from work for companies of smaller sizes.”

# The First Biglaw Firm To Match Becomes The Latest Firm To Match... It Makes Sense, Trust Us
## It took some 24 days, but Proskauer is matching in full.

Proskauer calls.

When Milbank unveiled the new $190K salary scale, [Proskauer became the first Biglaw firm to hop aboard](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-match-the-new-associate-raises/), jumping on the very next day. In a June 5 memo, the firm raised associate salaries in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and D.C. (which excludes Proskauer’s offices in Newark, New Orleans, and Boca Raton).

And then… nothing. While Simpson tossed in summer bonuses and Cravath raised senior associate salaries a bit over the Milbank scale, Proskauer’s initial match faded into memory.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Now, on the cusp of the July 1 effective date of the new raises, Proskauer has dispelled any anxiety among their associates with an updated memo confirming that they will be matching the Cravath-adjusted salary figures and offering the Simpson summer bonuses.

Loyal Proskauer associates doubtless expected this, but it’s still good to get the announcement out of the way.

(Check out the full memo on the next page.)

Recall that it’s reader tips that allow us to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Individualized Bonuses Can't Hide The Lack Of Special Bonuses At This Biglaw Firm
## No special bonuses for you!
By [Kathryn Rubino](https://abovethelaw.com/author/krubino/)

There’s a reason why the gold standard at law firms is lockstep bonuses — hell, that’s true for all Biglaw compensation. It engenders collegiality, avoids potential problems of black box compensation (like favoritism and unconscious bias), and makes it makes it really easy for associates to anticipate what they’ll make in any given year.

But, alas, that’s not what’s meant to be at Perkins Coie. It’s been a bumpy year at the firm, with[ the firm announcing in April that ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-biglaw-firms-rolling-out-good-news-for-now/)the partnership was deferring ~19 percent of their compensation. Then [beginning with their June paychecks](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/am-law-50-firm-slashes-associate-salaries-indefinitely/), non-partner attorneys saw a 15 percent salary cut, staff making $200,000+ took a 15 percent cut, and staff making $125,000-$200,000 saw compensation cut by 10 percent. But things really seemed to be turning a corner when, [in October, the firm announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/salary-rollbacks-and-full-restoration-payments-for-am-law-50-firm/) the salary cuts were over and full restoration payments were the order of the day.

So, many associates thought they just might get full market bonuses. And while *some* associates did receive the year-end market rate, the special bonuses that became [all the rage among elite Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/) starting in the fall, given in appreciation of associates’ hard work during the pandemic, were nowhere to be found. Those special bonuses range from $7,500 to $40,000, depending on class year, and, at other firms, are in addition to the year-end bonus numbers — so there’s a lot of cash Perkins Coie associates are missing out on compared with their peers at other firms.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And the reaction from tipsters has been understandably upset:

Individual memos were given to each associate with some making market bonuses and others not. The big headline is that they aren’t paying the special Covid bonuses that the other firms are offering. Also no additional dollars for top billers. Associates are pissed.

As has been done in years past, Perkins Coie is sending out individual bonus memos to all of its associates. While I’m pleased with my market bonus (though I’m not sure everyone is on the Cravath scale), Perkins Coie did NOT issue a special Covid bonus like so many of the other firms have done. As the 54th highest grossing lawfirm in the world, I’m pretty disappointed that they couldn’t pay the Covid bonus.

But like any firm with individualized bonuses, we depend on our readers to help fill out the details. So, are you a Perkins Coie associate? What do you think about bonuses this year? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

# Guess Which Biglaw Leader Is Raising Salaries Now...
## Another (white)shoe falls.

UPDATE (6/9/16 1:06 p.m.): Now we know about the summers… read on.

It’s amazing how quickly partners can get something done once Cravath’s pushed them to do it. Two days after [Cravath set the new bar](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) for associate compensation, firms are falling all over themselves to hand out raises to their associates. Biglaw partnerships are notoriously cautious and slow-moving, but Cravath has a way of moving that process along whether it’s bonus season or associate raises.

Now Davis Polk joins the mix, announcing the full adoption of the Cravath pay scale. Too bad they weren’t willing to go over the top — like [they did in bonus season](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/associate-bonus-watch-davis-polk-beats-simpson/) a couple years ago — and get us to $190K

The [memo is here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/guess-which-biglaw-leader-is-raising-salaries-now/2/). A few items of note:

1. Much as Simpson Thacher indicated that it would provide comparable raises to “[English law qualified associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/simpson-thacher-finally-announces-its-new-salary-scale/),” Davis Polk also takes the time to recognize its foreign-based attorneys with a promised increase based on their seniority.

2. This scale goes to ’07/$325K as opposed to topping out with the class of ’08/$315K. Right now this is the big divergence point between firms issuing raises.

3. Counsel compensation is being “addressed separately.” Another subject we’ll revisit in a future post.

Also no word in this memo about summers, but it’s not been uncommon for summers to get their news from a separate email so we’ll let you know if and when we hear about that. UPDATE: Summers will be enjoying this raise too. Managing Partner Tom Reid announced the move at a breakfast Q&A with summers.

Congrats DPW!

With the last Scantron bubble filled and ExamSoft countdown complete, thousands of law students will soon take to the streets in an attempt to show off what they have learned to their (hopefully) future employers during their summer employment.

While much has been written on how to excel as a Biglaw summer associate (do whatever is asked of you, do it well, and don’t get drunk at the outings) or with a judicial clerkship (research well, use big words appropriately, and don’t get drunk… well ever), less is authored on how to succeed during a summer spent in-house. Although each in-house department may vary, there are some universal truths which, if followed, may help in-house students turn their summer position into a full-time job post-graduation.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In a world where the going rate of a summer associate at Biglaw is actually included in marketing materials, it is easy to think this loose-lipped approach to salary is accepted in the in-house world as well. Think again.

My law students regularly work with non-legal team members from all departments across our network. Team members who stereotypically think all lawyers are loaded and who have no concept of a $200,000 student loan. Team members who may barely make above minimum wage despite working at the company for over twenty years. Even good-natured attempts to empathize with a non-legal team member about being a “poor” student will fail.

Lamenting you make 25 percent of what your friend who is spending the summer with Biglaw makes still lets the team member know you make roughly 500 percent more than they do as a mere summer employee. Not only did you fail at making a new friend by making them feel devalued, they likely will have no problem letting their colleagues, including those with the ability to hire, know how arrogant and/or overpaid they think you are. In the in-house world, even the lowest member on the totem pole can affect your potential to be hired.

Take Every Assignment with a Smile

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Time and resources are often few and far between in any in-house legal department, as we are tasked with sifting through endless issues routed for legal review because it mentions something vaguely legal0sounding. Case in point, I was asked to review a popcorn machine rental agreement a department manager was bringing in for their team since they heard all contracts needed to be reviewed by legal. While this particular contract fell a few million dollars shy of the legal review threshold, I wanted to encourage their willingness to seek out legal input and happily obliged to review it. As you might guess, this review was promptly delegated to a law student.

Believe me when I say I understand you believe reviewing a popcorn machine rental agreement is a waste of your time, but keep it to yourself. Your cubicle will likely be located wherever we have space available and you just may be seated in the very department of the manager who requested legal review in the first place. Mocking your assignment might not only discourage that department from sending over the next contract which may actually need legal review, it will again make you appear arrogant and above the team members whose opinion the hiring manager will seek out before extending an offer.

As a summer associate in Biglaw, you have to best your peers while displaying your intellect.  As a judicial clerk, you must demonstrate your command of the English language and your mastery of the Bluebook. While in-house, of course your intellect is important, but if you want to make a lasting impression, show me you can get along with anyone in the company on down to the janitor.

An in-house counsel’s office can only be successful when other departments and non-legal colleagues feel comfortable reaching out for help. You have to work hard to build the relationships necessary to effectively perform your job. After all, you can only advise and counsel on issues that you know exist.

As an in-house manager, show me you can engender the trust of your colleagues, no matter their title, and you can bet your résumé will receive special consideration. Dismiss the importance of your assignments and loudly complain of being a poor student while still managing to fly to every summer destination wedding and you can bet neither I, nor any of my colleagues, will see you at next year’s Christmas party.

# Morning Docket: 08.31.23
## * Ron DeSantis rammed through massive tort reform in December to the delight of Florida residents who barely understand torts. They're about to find out what it all means when insurance companies refuse to pay up for Idalia. [[Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/08/hurricane-idalia-desantis-home-insurance/)] * Remember the Second Amendment exists to protect your right to hide guns in your belly fat. [[People](https://people.com/2-people-injured-after-woman-concealed-gun-in-her-belly-fat-chicago-white-sox-game-report-7963527)] * NY AG says Trump overinflated his net worth by upwards of $2.2 billion in a shock to absolutely no one. [[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/30/politics/donald-trump-wealth-new-york/index.html)] * Texas GOP's ""Death Star"" legislation, designed to give the state legislature the power to strike down local laws and ordinances destroyed like all Death Stars because of tiny, yet fatal, flaw. In this case it's because it's entirely unconstitutional. Wow... that's much bigger than the womp rats I used to target in my T-16 back home. [[Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1716640)] * Alex Murdaugh loses phone privileges. [[NY Post](https://nypost.com/2023/08/31/alex-murdaugh-loses-prison-phone-tablet-privileges-after-lawyer-records-phone-call-for-documentary/)] * Squire Patton Boggs partner set to take break from violent, rough and tumble Biglaw world to referee Rugby World Cup. [[LegalCheek](https://www.legalcheek.com/2023/08/squire-patton-boggs-partner-set-to-referee-rugby-world-cup/)] * In new phase of Hollywood strike, workers have filed comments with the FTC asking it to probe industry consolidation. And while fair compensation is a great reason to break up Hollywood, at least someone has to be mad about WarnerBrosDiscovery doing... any of the things it's done.

Earlier this week, [Apple’s earnings](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/26/apple-reports-fy-second-quarter-earnings.html) came out. The company made “only” $50.56 billion, and compared to last year this is lower – omygosh! As I write this, the stock is down by about 8 percent. Apparently this is a “bad” thing?

A recent American Lawyer [article](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755430908) has negative spin in pointing that there are signs of a slowdown in the Am Law 100 because “growth” has slowed from last year. It says that total gross revenue for the Am Law 100 “inched up” 2.7 percent to (only?) $83.1 billion and net income increased 3.3% to $32.8 billion. The article says that that “represents a significant slowing across the market compared with the previous year, when revenue grew 4.6% and net income [grew] 7.5%.”

The article – and [others](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/?rf=1) now being published – looks at which firms had good or bad years based on their year-over-year growth or non-growth. Indeed, Quinn Emanuel had an “off year” because its profits per partner [dropped by 10 percent to $4.4 million](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/). When I read this, I immediately started a fund at Duval & Stachenfeld to raise money for the Quinn Emanuel partners. Four point four million in profits per partner is close to the best any law firm has ever done in the history of the world (with I think only one law firm even doing better, other than Quinn itself last year). I congratulate Quinn on an incredible year. Is Am Law serious that this is an “off” year?

And to be fair to Am Law, they do mention that over the past years Quinn has enjoyed “meteoric” growth.

My question for consideration is why we have this pre-occupation with year-over-year “growth” as the most critical metric for businesses, and law firms, when we know intellectually that it is statistically certain that the one thing that will never happen is that earnings or profits will “grow” in a slow and steady upward trend on an annualized basis. It not only rarely happens, I don’t think it “ever” happens.

So if we know that steady upward year-over-year growth is like a unicorn, why is it that the media, and hence ourselves, measure ourselves against this metric?  Why do we do this?

Well, of course growth in profits and earnings is “good,” so it makes sense for us to keep seeking this as a goal — and of course I have no beef with that. And if you are the managing partner – or any partner – you can point to “growth” as a measure of your success.

Also, long-term growth or decline (over, say, a five- or ten-year period) is certainly valuable – but artificially whacking up the analysis every year by comparison  to the prior year and making determinations that the business is doing “good” or “bad” based on that one year comparison seems to me to be “dumb and dumberer.”

I wonder – why doesn’t Am Law publish the last five years trend for its law firms instead of only comparison to the prior year?

My answer to the question as to “why” we put such emphasis on year-over-year comparison is very simplistic. I think it is just that we all (i.e., people) fell into this pattern long ago and we just think this way for no particular reason except that is what we have always done. And the media, always seeking to say something interesting to capture the attention of readers, leads the way by “spinning” year-over-year growth as a good thing and year-over-year shrinkage as a bad thing. Readers don’t really have the time to deeply evaluate what they read on a consistent basis, so we all fall for this media bias.

Consider – we get depressed in the United States when we have the highest standard of living mankind has ever seen in hundreds of thousands of years because one year is “worse” than last year. If our economy expanded 10 percent one year (in an incredible boom) and then fell 3 percent the next year (a modest drop), our country would freak out. Investors get upset with Apple for “only” earning more money than any corporation has ever earned in history. And we find we are concerned about poor Quinn Emanuel for having what I think is the second-best annual earnings of any law firm in world history.

Or consider a firm that hits a major one-time contingency fee one year. Should it be proud that its earnings rose that year or be upset that they fall the next year when there is no such contingency fee?  Of course not – and no one would make this argument because it is so obvious as a one-time event. But it is no different when a firm’s clients are more – or less – active in any given year, which means profitability rises or falls commensurately. A single year doesn’t mean anything is particularly wrong or right.

Ultimately, if we measure our success against an idiosyncratic and unreliable measuring stick, expectation of continued year over year growth, we are bound to be incorrectly disappointed, or incorrectly uplifted, and possibly make decisions based on our belief that there is something “wrong” when things are possibly just fine or based on the belief that things are “good” when they are really not good at all.

Indeed, falling earnings for a law firm when its client base and brand are strengthening, or it is investing for the future, may mean the firm us doing just fine. Commensurately, rising earnings based on a single client having a one-time growth spurt may mask defects in the firm.

So – to all of you managing partners – and all of you partners in law firms – and all of you attorneys employed by law firms – and all of you administrative personnel employed by law firms – I say that there is nothing “wrong” with celebrating year-over-year growth if you want a reason to have a party now and then; however, don’t mislead yourselves in falling for such growth or shrinkage as telling the whole story or even a large part of the story. You may be on the last stage of growth for a firm that is about to fall apart, or you may be shrinking in revenues while investing prudently and intelligently for the future.

To conclude, there is no reason to look at year-over-year growth as anything more than a mere metric for comparison purposes. Growth or shrinkage can be a useful metric for sure, but it should be looked at as a trend over longer time increments – five years – or even ten years – as a part (but never the whole) analysis of how your law firm is really doing economically.

# The First Biglaw Firm To Match The New Associate Raises
## Is $190,000 the new Biglaw normal?

California litigation boutique [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-first-firm-has-matched-the-new-milbank-scale/) was the very first firm to match the new $190,000 scale, but it takes Biglaw firms longer to make these decisions. It took a day, but the top of the Biglaw world has responded to the Milbank raises announced yesterday with raises of their own. Proskauer has just announced (via an associate town hall, a full memo will be forthcoming this afternoon) it will be matching the new compensation scale, meaning associates at the firm can now expect raises in the range of $10,000 – $15,000, depending on class year.

For those who haven’t memorized it yet, the new market scale is as follows:

Classes 2018/2017: $190,000
Class 2016: $200,000
Class 2015: $220,000
Class 2014: $250,000
Class 2013: $275,000
Class 2012: $295,000
Class 2011: $315,000
Class 2010: $330,000

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
UPDATE 6/5/2018 4:48 p.m.: The Proskauer memo is out! The offices getting the raises are: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and D.C. And, yes, summer associates also get to share in the largesse.

Milbank’s surprise salary raise is predicted to draw a clear line between the haves and have nots of Biglaw. Though the 2016 salary bump, spearheaded by Cravath, led to near universal adoption of a new market scale, there’s a lot more financial pressure on the bottom have of the Am Law 200. For this set of raises, many are predicting firms will be a lot more careful before they get on board, and it may even lead to a bifurcated market. Oh, the horror of not every Biglaw associate making the same amount of money that awaits us all.

But for now, the associates at Proskauer can rejoice. Their firm is safely on the top side of the compensation mountain.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Fishbowl Is A Great Gossip App And Website For Legal Professionals
## The legal profession is stronger when there is transparency on the happenings at legal workplaces.

Earlier this year, I got an alert that my name was mentioned on a website and app called [Fishbowl](https://www.fishbowlapp.com/), which I hadn’t heard of before. Someone posted that I was the worst writer on Above the Law (with a fifth-grade proficiency), and a bunch of people wrote responses agreeing with the original poster or voicing support for the opinions expressed in my articles. Let me conclude that argument by saying that I am definitely the worst writer at Above the Law (but I think my articles are at least at a sixth-grade level!). However, participating in the exchange, and reading all of the comments people wrote, introduced me to Fishbowl and all of the benefits that app and website can have on the legal profession.

Let me first say that if people want to gripe about happenings at their law firms or other legal workplaces, and the matter is newsworthy, they should email Above the Law at [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Tip). Above the Law has a much wider audience than a discussion board can ever have, and this website with all of its commentary and curation may have a larger impact than an anonymous forum. However, for smaller matters, there is real value to voicing concerns about the happenings of workplaces, asking for advice, and just participating in online discussions about a profession without revealing one’s identity.

I have always been interested in the power of anonymous communications. Shortly after I started college, Honesty Box was a big app on Facebook, which allowed users to submit anonymous comments to people. I used this app all the time providing feedback that I thought would be useful in various contexts. Juicy Campus, an anonymous online forum, was also popular when I was a college student, and I found value in some of the posts on that website (although much of the content was pretty toxic). Later in my career, I used anonymous email applications to provide tips to Above the Law and others in order to inform them of news stories that I thought were important to expose.

Anonymity has a long history in American culture, and Benjamin Franklin, John Marshall, the authors of the Federalist Papers, and other founding fathers used anonymity to have more flexibility when expressing their views. It is generally recognized that people will be more forthcoming when they can present views anonymously since individuals might not receive the same blowback if they say something anonymously than if they use their real identities. This is why anonymous speech receives considerable protection, and some of the most forthcoming columnists on this website were anonymous authors who presumably had more flexibility with what they could publish.

On Fishbowl, anonymity also means that people are more open to sharing gossip and other news about the legal profession than they might in other contexts. In addition, people also feel more emboldened to add to the story on Fishbowl anonymously and increase the amount of information people have about a given situation at a law firm or other legal workplace, which can be extremely helpful to other legal practitioners. People can also ask questions more openly on anonymous forums since they may not want to expose themselves if their identities could be revealed.

Transparency is really important in the legal profession. For far too long, law firms have kept salaries close to the chest so that people might not discover that they are getting underpaid, or that salaries are based on illicit criteria rather than merit. Stories of improper behavior at legal workplaces have also been swept under the rug for years since people could not often convey such stories in public and confirm with other people that there is a common problem at a given shop. Moreover, a desire not to be the subject of gossip on an anonymous forum like Fishbowl might compel people to act better towards their subordinates.

Of course, there are downsides to anonymous forums. Some of the content on Fishbowl can be snarky, and downright mean. I can tell you from firsthand experience, it does not feel great to be the subject of harsh and somewhat cruel criticism on an anonymous forum, although it is awesome to see so many people come to my defense. But the benefits of anonymity far outweigh the costs. Cruelty is just a part of being on the internet, and if anyone wants to see some real anonymous meanness, they can read any of the comments on Above the Law articles before the feature was wisely disabled years ago.

In any event, the legal profession is stronger when there is transparency on the happenings at legal workplaces, and this website is a good outlet for the larger stories. If legal professionals wish to gossip about less newsworthy happenings at law firms and seek candid advice on a given subject within the legal industry or other professions, Fishbowl is a solid outlet for this activity.

Another day, another ranking for lawyers to ogle in a search for meaning as they attempt to get through the day’s billables in this “post-pandemic” world we’re living in. Despite all the unrest and change in the world thanks to COVID-19, this is still the life of a Biglaw attorney, always on the hunt for confirmation that their firm is the best firm, the one that’s hitting all of its essential metrics year after year. If that sounds like you (and you might as well admit it, it probably does), then you should check out the latest offering from the American Lawyer, the annual A-List ranking.

Are you unfamiliar with this ranking? Here are all of the metrics that it measures to determine which Biglaw firms are the best of the best:

The A-List recognizes firms based on a combination of factors, both financial and cultural: revenue per lawyer, pro bono commitment, associate satisfaction, racial diversity and gender diversity (the percentage of equity partners who are women), with RPL and pro bono given double weight. Each metric measures Am Law 200 firms’ relative performance—a firm’s score in a given category is based on its ranking among all 200 firms. Each category, as well as the overall score, is based on a 100-point scale.

Baker McKenzie has eliminated 46 staff positions — all in the London office in professional and business roles — and another 33 jobs are still at risk as part of a firm-wide assessment. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/06/25/baker-mckenzie-cuts-46-london-staff-positions-405-39544/) American Lawyer, a total of 97 roles were placed under review by the firm. Eighteen employees in those positions resigned, and 46 have been eliminated so far (15 were identified as redundant, while there remain 31 cut altogether). The remaining 33 jobs, which are across the human resources, finance, business development, marketing and communications, and knowledge management departments, are still at risk.

The firm offered the following statement on the cuts:

“The ongoing review in London is part of the firm’s three-year global reorganization of our professional business services functions, which includes the creation of new roles, growth in our service centers and investments in new technologies and new services,” a firm spokesperson said in a statement.

“We are grateful to our people in London and globally for their engagement, professionalism and patience throughout this process to date,” the statement said. “We continue to work with those still in roles at risk and in cases where suitable alternative roles are unavailable will offer an enhanced redundancy package.”

Another big change on the way for the London office is smaller — though potentially nicer — digs:

“Like every law firm, we’ve concluded we can probably do with less space,” a London partner at the firm said. “One option is to refurbish the current building and add another floor on top, but everyone would like to move to a nice shiny office. We’re in a good location but the space is tired, and clients want the wow factor.”

Baker McKenzie is reportedly looking to downsize its office space by 10,00 sq. ft.

We immediately initiated all necessary steps to protect employees, clients, courts, and business partners on the basis of an action plan. … [T]he virus test started within 24 hours after our partner’s illness became known. We conducted it on our own initiative and at our own expense in order to obtain certainty. Last Friday, in a first wave of testing, over 200 employees were tested, and this Monday an additional 80 employees were tested.

— a statement from Austrian firm Wolf Theiss, commenting on its [ailing partner’s coronavirus diagnosis](https://www.vindobona.org/article/coronavirus-vienna-law-firm-tests-three-employees-positive). The 72-year-old lawyer fell ill in February and since then, the firm has been trying to protect the rest of its employees. Thus far, three other employees have [tested positive for coronavirus](https://www.vindobona.org/article/coronavirus-vienna-law-firm-tests-three-employees-positive) and have been placed in quarantine. “[D]ue to the immediate continuous testing of our employees,” the firm noted, “it is ensured that client, court, and employee contacts are only made by employees who have tested negative.”

# More Big Bonus Bucks Are Being Handed Down At This Biglaw Firm
## And the firm's youngest associates don't need to worry about meeting billable requirements!

As another hour passes by, another Biglaw firm announces a special bonus. This time around, it’s Schulte Roth & Zabel — a firm that brought in $465,177,000 gross revenue in 2019 — that’s matching the Davis Polk scale.

The firm is offering special bonuses to associates all the way up to the class of 2012, while bonuses for elder classes and counsel will be communicated separately (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/srz-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Associates at the firm are expected to meet (or exceed) the firm’s customary hours requirements to get these bonuses in hand, but not to worry, because catch-up payments will be available in December to those who miss the mark for the June payout date. The class of 2020 will not be expected to meet any hourly requirement in order to receive the June bonus. How nice. Congratulations to everyone at SRZ!

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/srz-special-bonus-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Schulte Roth & Zabel.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for all of your help!

# Don't Be 'Idiotic' -- Yes, Law Firms Really Have To Change

The whole profession is changing rapidly, and to just drift along, make incremental changes and not have a dedication to innovation in some way seems idiotic to me. And the more vexing thing from a firm standpoint is the bigger-sized firms are doing more and doing it faster. But there isn’t anything they are doing that smaller sized firms couldn’t do, realistically. Mostly all of the innovations available in the way you serve clients are available to everyone.

–Thomas Clay, principal at Altman Weil and co-author of the recent [Law Firms In Transition](http://www.altmanweil.com/LFiT2018) survey, [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/2018/05/21/managing-partners-frustration-mounts-as-law-firm-innovation-stagnates/) that more law firms need to commit to innovate and make changes to how they deliver client services. According to the survey, only about a third of firms were pursuing innovative solutions, with Biglaw firms much more likely to embrace change than their Small Law counterparts.

According to a new report from [Public Citizen](https://corporatepresidency.org/biglaw), the Trump administration has 76 different lawyers in key positions (or nominated for key positions) from either Biglaw or the legal departments of top corporations.

# Guess Which Biglaw Firm That's NOT In The Top 25 Just Matched While So Many Others Twiddle Their Thumbs
## The top of the Am Law 100 revenue rankings feature a bevy of firms that haven't matched. And the bottom of that features one that has.

Now comes Kramer Levin.

Managing partner Paul S. Pearlman just informed U.S. associates — the firm has offices in New York and Silicon Valley — that they would be receiving a raise to match the Biglaw market effective July 1. Summer associates aren’t included in this memo, but presumably they’re getting a separate communique.

The firm is fully matching the market numbers for associates and paying out the summer bonuses that have become standard. Kramer is offering a couple of avenues to earn the summer bonus — either meeting the firm’s billables requirement on an annualized basis for the first six months of the year, or meeting the billables requirement for the year dated July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018. That’s more fair than some firms, who have offered to prorate the billables requirement for the first six months, leaving attorneys who bill more in Q3 and Q4 out in the cold.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


Back in 2016, Kramer Levin provided a salary scale that went beyond the top class (then the class of 2007), offering $5000/year raises for associates beyond that threshold. It looks like the firm has abandoned that approach with this set of raises, opting instead to offer every associate beyond the class of 2010 $10K more than the top of the Cravath scale. That said, $350K is still more than any of those attorneys were getting under the old scale, so they can’t really complain.

Wow. It’s sooooo amazing that Kramer Levin, a firm sitting at 93rd on the Am Law 100 gross revenue ranking, can offer up raises when firms like Latham at 2nd can’t bring themselves to announce. Or that Reed Smith at 25th [claims they can’t afford](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/another-firm-announces-it-will-only-be-hiring-cheap-and-desperate-associates-this-fall/). Really amazing.

(Full memo on the next page, which you probably assumed if you’ve ever read one of these posts before.)

# Looking At Supply And Demand To Pinpoint Why Outside Counsel Rates Continue To Rise

It’s official: Outside counsel rates are high and getting higher, according to a [CounselLink 2023 Trends Report Mid-Year Special Edition.](https://ln-counsellink.lexisnexis.com/trends/mid-year-edition)

In 2022, year-on-year statistics showed that the average partner billing rate rose by 4.5%, the highest increase in the 10-year history of the CounselLink Trends Report. January to July 2023 data, compared with the same period the previous year, show an even higher increase in average outside counsel billing rates: 5.7%.

The continued climb in partner billing rates could be a surprise, until you look at these obvious culprits:

Law Firm Billing Rates And Supply And Demand

In [this Above the Law article](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/biglaw-firms-have-too-many-lawyers-with-attorney-productivity-at-an-historic-low/) citing a Wells Fargo’s Legal Specialty Group survey of 130 firms, including 66 of the Am Law 100, during first-half 2023 “lawyer headcount is up 3.9 percent, but demand is down, leading to a decline in productivity to the tune of 4.1 percent.” It seems that law firms are opting to wait out a drop in demand by clients for law firm services, which only delays the inevitable for associate deferrals and terminations.

Over the summer, we saw the deferral of associate start dates at some big law firms. Those in the technology sector fell victim to the slashing of thousands of corporate jobs which directly influenced incoming associate positions and technology practice areas. These productivity fluctuations, also seen in mergers and acquisitions, most certainly affected supply and demand.

With the unemployment rate hovering at 3.8%, recruiting top law firm talent is a significant investment in a firm’s future success. This also means that the coveted billable hour is sliced and dispensed among senior lawyers and their associates. To justify worth, everyone needs to document billable time, which suggests that some associates are left holding the bag with few billable hours inside to support their own performance — a tick-tick of the time bomb to termination.

Taking Action

The continuing rise in outside counsel rates is not sustainable.

Our symbiotic relationship runs in cycles, fluctuates with the economy, and depends on how we coalesce. As law firms continue to identify ways to maintain profitability, general counsel and chief legal officers focus on mitigating risk to their legal spend (while protecting the organization from the influence of negative market factors).

To manage during disruptive times, here are several suggested ways to control rising outside counsel costs:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
- Set up a preferred provider program. Work with the law firms that want to collaborate with you to develop a more balanced relationship.
- Use an enterprise legal management solution to approve timekeepers, monitor timekeeper billing, and ensure that an unapproved timekeeper doesn’t bill five hours or less without adding value.
- Develop a rate-review process audited twice annually.
- Mix up relationships: consider hiring midsized law firms with equally astute lawyers to manage legal matters. Many smaller firms offer billable rates lower than those of larger law firms.
- Incentivize the law firm that accomplishes previously set goals, brings home a win, and has the philosophy of being accountable for litigation outcomes.

# The Struggle: Will Past Alcoholism And DUIs Prevent You From Being Admitted To The Bar?

Welcome to the latest installment of [The Struggle](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-struggle/), a series where we examine the mental-health issues that students encounter during the oftentimes grueling law school experience. We are posting these stories because sometimes what law students really need is to know that they’re not alone in their pain. Sometimes what law students need is to know that they’ve got a friend who is willing to share not just in their triumphs, but also in their struggles. These are real e-mails and messages we’ve received from real readers.

If these issues resonate with you, please reach out to us. Your stories need to be heard. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=The%20Struggle), text us at (646) 820-8477, or tweet us [@atlblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog). We will share your stories anonymously. You may be able to help a law student who needs to know that someone else has been there before and survived.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
I got sober during law school over four years ago and I wanted to share that, in my experience with the New York Bar, they were extremely accepting of my status as a recovering alcoholic. I disclosed on my application that I had received so many citations for drinking-related offenses (including a DUI) that I couldn’t even remember all of them or track them down. I was expecting a litany of questions in my character and fitness interview (all New York applicants have a character and fitness interview).

They simply said, “Congratulations on your sobriety. Welcome to the New York Bar.”

I encourage anyone who believes they are struggling with alcohol or drug addiction to get help. Dealing with it now will greatly reduce the chances of serious consequences down the line. Getting sober (and going to 12-step meetings) during law school was the best thing I’ve ever done. I’m now at a Biglaw firm and see colleagues who may have issues themselves, and I’m incredibly grateful that I had the opportunity to handle it before it could adversely affect my legal career.

I’d also encourage students to reach out to their local lawyers assistance program, which will likely be able to connect them with someone who has gone through what they’re going through and come out the other side a happier and more successful lawyer.

Thanks again for shining light on this important issue.

Most colleges and universities have counseling and psychological services resources that students can turn to if they are in crisis or would like counseling, even after hours. If these services are not available at your school, and if you’re depressed and in need help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline ([1-800-273-8255](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org)) or a [lawyer assistance program](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/resources/lap_programs_by_state.html) in your state. Remember that you are loved, so please reach out if you need assistance, before it’s too late.

# Am Law 200 Firm Hires COO In Order To Adopt A Biglaw Success Model
## Will a COO be able to help this firm revamp its practices and increase its profitability?

Biglaw firms across the country used the first month of the new year to solidify their business strategies for 2024, and at some firms, that included hiring essential personnel to handle operations.

Eckert Seamans Cherin & Mellott — a firm that brought in $139,650,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 187 in the most recent Am Law 200 — recently hired a chief operations officer after going for 10 years without one. Eddie Raychaudhuri, who formerly served as practice group director at DLA Piper and pricing manager at several other Biglaw firms, has taken the job, and plans to hit the ground running.

“Being a holistic manager is appealing to me,” Raychaudhuri told the [Legal Intelligencer](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2024/01/30/eckert-seamans-brings-on-first-coo-in-10-years/). “I could tell [when I was interviewing with Eckert] there was a real appetite for understanding how larger international law firms practice and manage their firms. I’m looking forward to bringing that kind of sophistication [to Eckert],” he concluded.

Why is the firm interested in a COO after going without one for a decade? Here’s more from the [Legal Intelligencer](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2024/01/30/eckert-seamans-brings-on-first-coo-in-10-years/):

[CEO Scott] Cessar added that as he assumed the role of the firm’s CEO, he and the firm’s management team realized the 300-lawyer firm could benefit from adopting Big Law strategy as it continues to compete in a consolidating market.

“We wanted to see what we can learn from [larger firms] to improve our management structure, our financial performance,” Cessar explained. “Just going through the process of interviewing, we learned a lot of things.”

In particular, Cessar and the firm are looking at Raychaudhuri to help increase profitability, analyze collections, and evaluate client intake processes, for a start.

Congratulations to Raychaudhuri on landing the role, and best of luck to Eckert Seamans as the firm attempts to upgrade its operations practices.

# Am Law 100 Firm Raises Salaries... And Infuriates Associates
## It takes something special to make people boo a raise.

We’ve been waiting on [Hunton & Williams](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/hunton-williams/) to make a move. A month before Cravath turned over the apple cart, Hunton was crowing about raising associate salaries to [put everyone on the $160K track](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-a-biglaw-firm-moves-to-market-across-america/). Apparently, it was all well and good to wildly throw money around offices that had no business matching New York scale, but when the top of the market moved, the firm had to take several weeks to figure out what happened.

Well, the good news for Hunton & Williams associates is that the firm [is adopting a $180K starting salary](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/am-law-100-firm-raises-salaries-kind-of/2/) for its New York, McLean, D.C., Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco offices. Other offices will remain where they were as of the raises in May. This change takes effect on September 1.

So most people are happy, right? Think again. The second paragraph of this memo drops a hammer:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In addition, effective April 1, 2017, compensation for associates in all of the firm’s US offices other than entry level associates will be determined on an individual basis taking into account individual performance and market factors.

No more lockstep at all? Sure, that’s a crowd pleaser.

Hunton & Williams is moving to $180K starting salary in NYC, DC/McLean, CA, and TX, keeping $160K everywhere else, but ELIMINATING LOCKSTEP. Associates pissed.

I’d imagine so. The end of lockstep ushers in the sort of [black-box nonsense](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/jones-day-finally-raises-help-us-open-up-its-black-box-of-compensation/) that firms use to keep everyone just slightly undercompensated and unwilling to talk about it for fear that they’re the only ones who didn’t do a good enough job to earn the full check. It’s actually how companies get away with discrimination. This isn’t to say any black-box law firm is trying to discriminate, but it is troubling that a firm would embrace a practice with such an odious reputation. Especially in an industry where transparency is the norm.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Well, good luck, Hunton & Williams folk. And remember to send us your compensation details in April so we can blow up this black box just like [we did with Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/).

UPDATE (2:40 p.m.): A tipster points out that the third paragraph is also super shady. Apparently, on September 1, the firm is going to start fiddling with associate salaries and raising or — quite possibly — lowering them, as the firm sees fit. Now that’s a kick in the teeth.

(Memo on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/am-law-100-firm-raises-salaries-kind-of/2/)…)

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

During a time when health and wellness have finally been taken off the legal profession’s backburner, many firms are trying to help lawyers come to grips with mental health. Lawyers are more likely to suffer from depression than any other profession, but they often suffer in silence for fear of alerting their colleagues about their mental health disabilities and being stigmatized for the rest of their careers. One firm is trying to put a stop to that.

In a partnership between its Wellness Works initiative and its Mental Health Task Force, Reed Smith recently launched the #stopthestigma campaign, with the goal of helping lawyers get the assistance that they need without fear of any career repercussions. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2020/03/04/reed-smith-launches-mental-health-stop-the-stigma-campaign/) has the details:

Campaign events and activities include:

- An educational program Wednesday led by Mettie Spiess, a certified psychological health and safety adviser and founder of A World Without Suicide.
- A video series featuring lawyers and professional staff at the firm and mental health allies sharing their stories.
- A U.S.-wide mental health and safety leadership training session for firm managers.
- “Wear Green Day” on March 19 to raise awareness of the #stopthestigma campaign.
- An educational program March 26 led by Kelly Rentzel, general counsel for Texas Capital Bank, who will share her compelling story of living with bipolar disorder.
March is Mental Wellness Month, and it’s a perfect time to seek treatment if it’s something you’ve been avoiding doing. Stopping the stigma is an extremely worthy cause within the legal profession. Please take care of yourselves and you’ll find that not only is it possible to survive with a mental health setback, it’s possible to thrive.

Remember these?

At Bloomberg BNA, we often talk about how the Bloomberg Law platform enables our users to leverage technology, data and analytics, and AI to change the way they practice law and engage in the business of law. We are not alone. A number of companies innovating in the legal space are developing tools that they contend will alter in some fundamental ways how lawyers work.

As part of our rollout of a [new Bloomberg Law search and interface this month](http://www.lawsitesblog.com/2017/04/major-redesign-bloomberg-law-streamlines-search-interface.html), I’ve been speaking with a number of law firm leaders and their clients about how we are changing the way people work in the legal market. And as I say it more and more, I feel the need to hold myself accountable. It is a bold statement to say that your company and others are changing an industry for the better, and without specific examples, it sounds a bit grandiose and superficial. I wonder how such lofty phrasing sounds to attorneys who have been busy doing deals and litigating cases for the last 15 years. To someone so close to their work, change can be difficult to perceive. That’s true even when growth is happening fast. An analogy is an adolescent who doesn’t feel that much taller when her birthday comes around, but when her mom measures her against the kitchen wall, everyone can see the progress.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
So for anyone inclined to dismiss folks like me who talk about the changing practice of law (I remember recording my time in a red, hardcover diary as a first-year associate, so I can always point to that), let’s get out a ruler and see where we’re at. Consider these five specific examples of how the practice and business of law have truly changed over the last 10 years:

- Selecting outside counsel: Once upon a time, corporate clients chose their counsel primarily on the basis of pre-existing relationships. If you were on the outside looking in, your firm might get lucky to participate in a beauty contest. And yes, a decade ago corporate clients had the guidance of Chambers and scattered other rankings services to assist with the task. But today, the wealth of information available has changed the nature of the selection process drastically. Today’s analytical tools allow clients to see which firms have represented clients in different jurisdictions and in front of different judges as well as the type of transactions and cases they have worked on. As a general counsel, when my company was sued in a jurisdiction outside of the norm or if we were doing a deal involving a unique type of target or state or local law issues, I would call my contacts and ask for referrals. Now, in a matter of minutes, I can figure out the two or three most experienced choices to fit my fact pattern. This type of hard data has made choosing counsel a significantly more scientific process.
- Research: Conducting a 50-state survey was an initiation rite of the junior associate that could easily take the better part of a week. I still remember sitting in my firm library surrounded by a tremendous number of books (there used to be a lot more printed versions of those too) and typing page after page of memo after memo. It was even worse for my predecessors who had to rely on Liquid Paper in order to correct their mistakes in long memos rather than on Microsoft Word. Now, chart builders, trackers, heat maps and other tools allow lawyers to generate charts and other deliverables answering a research question in all 50 states in as little as a few minutes. The work product is even better and more compelling than before due to data visualizations that make analytics and trends that much more understandable.
- Document Production and Review: This is probably the most obvious of all. You don’t have to be old enough to remember Bates stamps to know just how dramatically document production and review have changed over the last 10 years. A [New York Times story meant to assuage fears](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/19/technology/lawyers-artificial-intelligence.html?_r=0) that artificial intelligence is going to replace lawyers included a statistic that would shock anyone who last practiced a decade ago: only four percent of lawyers’ time is now spent on document review. The fact that such a formerly significant aspect of Biglaw work has been automated and outsourced is the ultimate proof of how quickly the practice of law can change.

- From Service to Strategic: In an always-on era of commoditization and shrinking budgets, it is more important than ever for in-house groups and their advisors to position themselves as strategic partners rather than merely service groups. Data and analytics enable attorneys to create and distribute (often in an automated manner) strategic deliverables ranging from industry, company and competitor analyses (geopolitical risks, large deals, litigation, etc.) to daily or weekly dashboards that provide a holistic view of legal, finance, business and compliance issues impacting their internal and external clients.
- Enabling Smaller Firms to Grow: Columns like this tend to focus primarily on large law, but the practice and business of law at small to medium-sized firms is also rapidly changing. Historically, two of the largest obstacles to growth in these firms were the amount of time they had to spend on administrative work, as well as the lack of breadth and depth of expertise that caused them to have to refer out work that they would have preferred to keep in house. Virtual receptionists, CRMs and automated newsletters leave small-law practitioners with more time to practice law, and therefore grow their firms. Practical guidance and form documents that are easily searchable and discoverable in legal workflow platforms have eliminated the need to have file cabinets filled with relevant (and irrelevant) prototypes, and enabled these attorneys to keep more business at their firms rather than referring it out.
These are a few of the many tangible examples of how the practice and business of law continue to change. Technology, data and analytics, globalization and other factors will continue to accelerate change in the legal industry over the coming months and years, and more concrete examples will exist to support the lofty statements about changing the way attorneys practice and succeed in business.

# Vault Ranks The Best Summer Associate Programs (2024)
## Which law firm do summer associates love most?

Summer associate programs are still underway at Biglaw firms across the country, but in just a few weeks, early recruitment interviews will begin for next year’s eager crop of would-be summer associates. With current summers itching to receive their offers, what better time to release Vault’s closely watched rankings for the best summer associate programs?

Hot on the heels of Vault’s rankings of the [most prestigious](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/vault-100-rankings-2024/) law firms and the law firms with the [best quality of life](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/vault-best-firms-quality-of-life-2024/) comes the career website’s ranking of the best summer associate programs in Biglaw. Junior associates (first- through third-year attorneys) who summered at their current firms were asked to rank their experiences on how much fun the program was and how well it prepared them for life at the firm through six different categories (attorney interactions, substantive assignments, training and mentoring, preparation for associate life, quality of events, and satisfaction with firm-sponsored social opportunities and social interactions). From those ratings, Vault ranked the best summer associate programs in three categories: Attorney Interactions, Career Development, and Social Experiences. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that some of the firms that made the Top 10 list for having the best quality of life made the Top 10 for having the best summer associate program.

There was once again a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the [Top 10 Firms With the Best Summer Associate Programs](https://firsthand.co/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-summer-associate-programs) based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2024:

- Williams & Connolly

# Two Visions Of Trump's Future
## Only the coming of 2023 will defog my crystal ball.

As Yogi Berra once said:  “It’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.”

Donald Trump’s future is particularly opaque to me.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Here’s the first version of the future that I can imagine:

All of the prosecutors investigating Trump decide that he didn’t do anything wrong, or they doubt they can convict him. The prosecutors don’t indict. Or, perhaps, a prosecutor (or maybe two) charges Trump, but it proves terribly difficult to pick a jury. A secret Trump supporter ends up on the jury, refuses to convict, and the jury hangs. Trump stays out of jail.

Trump’s financial problems are overblown. Sure, many of his outside advisors have quit on him, but there are always more advisors where they came from.  Sure, Trump owes, and has personally guaranteed, a couple hundred million in debt that comes due over the next few years. But Trump’s brought in hundreds of millions in political contributions recently, and he’s become a very famous person. Overseas banks are delighted to do business with him; many folks will still pay for the privilege of having the Trump name on their properties; Trump’s good at surviving financial peril. Trump stays rich.

Trump’s civil liabilities are overstated. Any civil case can be settled by paying money. Trump settles the [pending defamation cases](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/97921430784324254); and the case brought by his niece, Mary; and whatever cases arise out of the storming of the Capitol on January 6. It’s just money; a few tens of millions and Trump’s civil woes are behind him.

The Republican Party rallies behind its obvious leader. Trump successfully supports primary challenges to most of the members of Congress who supported impeachment.

Four years from now, it’s 2016 all over again.

But here’s the second version of the future that I can imagine. I think it’s slightly more likely to occur than the first, but I’m terribly uncertain:

Several of the prosecutors pursuing Trump choose to indict him. It’s relatively easy for prosecutors to pick juries in New York City, Atlanta, or Washington, D.C. Those are heavily Democratic cities; any “12 good men and true” (sorry for the sexism, but [the quote’s from the 17th century](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/97921430784324254)) would be happy to convict on the appropriate evidence. The prosecutors conduct the trials of the century. We all enjoy the spectacle on television. Trump spends the rest of his life behind bars.

Trump’s financial problems are, of course, insurmountable. Trump’s largely in the entertainment and hospitality businesses; those businesses were crushed by the pandemic. All of his outside advisors quit on him. Massive debts are coming due. Nobody’s willing to gamble on the chance that Trump will survive by financing him. Trump stumbles into ruin.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Civil cases pose enormous risk to Trump. Trump has to testify under oath in multiple proceedings. He has to pay defense costs. Folks injured in the storming of the Capitol choose to name Trump personally in many lawsuits.  Plaintiffs, encouraged by counsel who want to make names for themselves, choose to roll the dice rather than settle. Trump is hit for massive verdicts.

Trump is bankrupt and imprisoned, and the Republican Party shuns its disgraced former leader.

Others try to replicate Trump’s style, but they’re all a mere shadow of the original. The Republican Party doesn’t go back to what it had been historically, but is driven by new policies meant to protect the working class more than the rich: high tariffs, low immigration, few foreign entanglements, and perhaps a more generous view toward universal health care or a higher minimum wage.

The party survives. Trump does not.

Frankly, I can imagine a future that looks like either of those visions. I can imagine other alternative futures, too. Only the coming of 2023 will defog my crystal ball.

# Data Security And Data Breaches: What's A Lawyer To Do?

Another day, another data breach. Major data breaches at major corporations show up in the headlines on what seems like a constant basis. What can lawyers do, both to protect their clients from breaches and to respond to breaches once they occur?

At last week’s last week’s [Global Privacy Summit](https://iapp.org/conference/global-privacy-summit-2018/sessions-gps18/), hosted by the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP), I attended two panels relevant to this subject:

Data security is more important than ever, as reflected in how it’s a legal requirement across industries. But it’s a very challenging issue for lawyers, as Kirk Nahra of Wiley Rein explained. Information security issues require a different mix of skills and knowledge compared to typical lawyerly work, and they also require lawyers to depend on the individuals who have the detailed technical knowledge that lawyers lack.

A law like HIPAA or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act might require a company to take “reasonable” or “appropriate” measures to protect data security. How can a lawyer, who is not a technologist or computer programmer or other IT professional, advise clients as to whether they’re in compliance?

Reliance of IT and cybersecurity professionals is essential, according to Holly Brady of Altria. Lawyers need to build relationships with these professionals and explain complex legal issues to them. Strong interpersonal and communication skills are essential, especially since some IT professionals might not be thrilled about lawyers getting involved in their work.

Another complication, identified by Tanya Forsheit of Frankfurt Kurnit, is the existence of multiple sources of law and multiple regulators in this space. These include, but aren’t limited to, state data security laws and the FTC’s [Section 5 authority](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/what-we-do/enforcement-authority). New regulators enter the space all the time, as do new lawsuits seeking to hold companies liable for data breaches (e.g., recent shareholder litigation involving companies like Yahoo! and Home Depot).

In this challenging climate, what’s a lawyer to do? The panel offered these recommendations:

1. Educate yourself about technology.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The lawyer’s duty of competence includes a duty to be competent not only in the law and its practice but also in technology, as a [growing number of states](https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2015/03/11-states-have-adopted-ethical-duty-of-technology-competence.html) have made explicit in their ethics rules. This is especially true, of course, for lawyers who work on issues relating to information security and data breaches.

Lawyers need to know enough about technology to ask the right questions of IT professionals and to oversee their work. Lawyers also need to understand enough of the terminology in this area so they can effectively communicate with IT professionals. (Familiarize yourself with the five core functions of the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.secmatters.com/blog/how-to-comply-with-the-5-functions-of-the-nist-cybersecurity-framework) if you don’t know them already.)

2. At the same time, accept what you don’t know.

You will never know enough about the technology as you might like or be as comfortable with data security issues compared to other aspects of your job. Just accept this and figure out how to make it work for you. You can still be an excellent lawyer in this area, as long as you can ask the right questions and communicate effectively.

3. Physician, heal thyself: make sure your own firm’s cybersecurity is strong.

Law firms have been [victims of hacking](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/beware-of-big-hacking-in-biglaw/) — and clients are paying more and more attention to how well their outside attorneys protect their data. So make sure that your own firm’s security protocols are robust.

Let’s say that, despite your and your client’s best efforts, a data breach occurs. What then?

For starters, for lawyers who have been practicing in the data-breach space or a while, you can’t just take the same old approach. Aravind Swaminathan of Orrick explained how incident response has changed over time.

Incident Response 1.0 was fairly straightforward, an exercising in sending out letters notifying affected parties of the data breach. Incident Response 2.0 was more robust, including forensic investigation into how the breach occurred and how future breaches can be prevented.

The phase we are in today, Incident Response 3.0, is far more complex and comprehensive. It includes not just breach notification and forensic investigation, but also brand and reputational management, navigation of regulatory concerns, and protection of privilege. There’s also a much greater focus on the part of regulators on individuals and their culpability — which is one way to get directors and officers very interested in issues of cybersecurity.

Jason Smolanoff of Kroll identified three main components to an incident response:

1. Investigation. This could last for anywhere from a week to two months.

2. Remediation. This includes a tactical aspect, which happens very quickly — deny the attacker further access to the network — and a strategic aspect, which involves repairing shortcomings in how your network was structured. The strategic aspect can take quite some time, since structural problems in a network can’t be fixed overnight.

3. Disclosures. These might be to clients, employees, or regulators, and they must be carefully structured to protect the corporate brand and the attorney-client privilege.

“You’re doing things you’ve always done,” Swaminathan explained, “but one thing that’s very different today is the storytelling aspect. What is the narrative we want to tell the public, the regulators, and others after the incident?”

Another factor that makes dealing with data breaches more complicated than ever has to do with technology. According to Swaminathan, it’s increasingly common to see hackers having “keys to the kingdom” — i.e., the right to access pretty much everything on a network. Responding to such an attack is especially difficult because of a lack of forensic evidence.

“The bad guys look like your people because they have the same access,” he said. “How can you determine what systems were accessed and what data was accessed when you don’t have all the forensic evidence?”

This is where forensic experts come in. As Jason Smolanoff explained, when Kroll gets called into an investigation, it focuses on the attackers’ [“TTPs”: tactics, techniques and procedures](https://www.optiv.com/blog/tactics-techniques-and-procedures-ttps-within-cyber-threat-intelligence). Through studying these TTPs, investigators can identify behaviors specific to the attacker, allowing them to deny the attacker further access to the network and to review what the attacker might have taken or damaged in terms of data.

Any response to a breach must also be designed with regulators in mind. Regulators in this area are more sophisticated than ever, so companies need breach response strategies and information security programs that are defensible. The crucial issue today is how quickly a company can detect an incident — because incidents are inevitable in this day and age — and how quickly a company can respond. The general standard here is reasonableness; a company cannot prevent all threats or reduce risk to zero, but it must take reasonable efforts to protect against breaches.

And what about the issue of individual liability for directors or officers related to a data breach? There are a number of possible theories.

There could be possible securities fraud, such as [insider trading before public disclosure of a breach](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/what-were-you-thinking-equifax-gc-probed-for-executive-stock-sales-before-public-learned-of-breach/), or material misrepresentations in a securities filing about a breach (including failure to disclose a breach if material). There could be wire fraud, if the data breach affects users of a company’s telecommunications or IT service. Individual employees, directors or officers are also sometimes named in consumer class actions arising out of data breaches. There’s no end to creative theories imposing criminal or civil liability on individuals related to data breaches.

“All you need is an AUSA [assistant U.S. attorney] who says here’s my theory and here’s the case I’m going to make my name on,” said Swaminathan, a former federal prosecutor himself. “And in three years I’m going to leave and become a law firm partner.”

Notifying affected individuals of a data breach could even give rise to problems under [Reg FD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_Fair_Disclosure), which requires publicly traded companies to disclose material information to all investors at the same time. Say there’s a data breach that affects only a certain number of customers or employees. The company has an obligation to notify the affected individuals — but if the breach is material, then it might also have an obligation to make a public disclosure, through a press release or [Form 8-K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_8-K) filing.

Not every incident is material and therefore reportable. But when an incident does rise to the level of materiality, then it must be disclosed — because the consequences of a failure to report are more grave than ever.

Ever wonder what Lex Luthor would do if he were a state judge? What kind of shenanigans would he get into as he tried to use the full powers of the judiciary for his own nefarious purposes? Would he try to coerce defendants in his courtroom to have a sexual relationship with him in return for lighter sentences?

This may seem like a random thought experiment, but in light of the recent allegations — which seem to reach almost soap-opera levels of evil — against Cross County, Arkansas, District Judge Joseph Boeckmann, the question has moved to the forefront of my mind. Yesterday, Arkansas state judicial ethics regulators filed charges against the judge, alleging he used his position and authority over defendants in front of him to receive personal and sexual favors — oh, and there’s also an allegation of kiddie porn possession.

The Arkansas Times [reports](http://m.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2015/11/17/ethics-charges-say-district-judge-joseph-boeckmann-traded-court-favors-for-work-and-sexual-favors) on the charges, which include having cases before the judge that involve men he’s been intimate with and influencing the cases against his sexual partner’s family members. But some of the more egregious claims include allegations that Judge Boeckmann made a habit of targeting younger men who were sentenced to community service and offering them some alternative “community service.” From the Arkansas Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission’s filing:

The ‘work’ usually consisted of picking up cans either alongside city roads in Wynne, or actually picking up cans at Boeckmannn’s residence, wherein Boeckmann would photograph the buttocks of the men as they were bending to retrieve the garbage. Multiple male litigants have been photographed by Boeckmann during these ‘community serivce’ type sentences. Boeckmann maintained these photographs of male litigants’ buttocks in his home for his own personal use. In addition to the illegal sentences, Boeckmann has used his judicial status to form relationships, personal and sexual, with male litigants. Beockmann has engaged in a consistent pattern of seeking out young Caucasain male litigants before Cross County District Court for the purpose of forming personal sexual relations with the litigants, thus creating a self-imposed conflict of interest for himself in his role as Cross County District Court judge.

Those that were targeted for these “substitutionary sentences” were also frequently solicited by Judge Boeckmann for sexual relations in exchange for a reduction in their sentence or dismissal, according to court papers. One such victim also indicated he assisted the judge in removing child pornography from his computer. The Arkansas Times also details the paper trail the judge’s alleged activities have left:

The complaint said banking records indicate Boeckmann gave money to lawyers who appeared before him and to law enforcement officials and to the court itelf [sic] on behalf of litigants in his court with whom he’d had personal or employment relationships.

Through his attorney, Judge Boeckmann has denied the charges: “We will file a document denying the charges and will be defending against the allegations in front of the commission.”

Due to the serious nature of the allegations, the case has also been referred to a special prosecutor; no word as yet on that separate investigation.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 07.26.17
## * ""[W]e will see what happens, time will tell, time will tell."" President Trump has reiterated how ""very disappointed"" he is that Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, but hasn't publicly stated in so many words that he wants to fire the AG. For what it's worth, it didn't take very long for time to tell what happened with James Comey, Marc Kasowitz, and Sean Spicer. [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/25/politics/trump-press-conference/index.html)] * Which in-house officials make the most money? Big Law Business took a look at the summary compensation tables from the 500 largest U.S. companies ranked by revenue to figure out the answer. Take a look at the list of the 30 highest earners, gasp at their eye-popping compensation, and then wonder why you haven't decided to move in-house yet. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/in-house-compensation-report-top-30-money-earners/)] * A three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit struck down Washington, D.C., regulations which required that residents prove they had a ""good reason to fear injury"" in order to obtain a concealed-carry permit for firearms, ruling that the carrying of firearms was a ""core"" Second Amendment right. The District may seek an en banc review of the decision. [[BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/a-dc-federal-court-just-ruled-carrying-guns-in-public-is-a?utm_term=.xiAxPDpNx#.exWEPqnWE)] * ""There is not a law firm function that happens without alcohol"" Do law firms enable alcoholism? In a word, yes -- and the fact that we still have to ask ourselves this when one-third of attorneys have admitted that they drink too much and even more have admitted that they have a serious drinking problem is simply appalling.

* “[W]e will see what happens, time will tell, time will tell.” President Trump has reiterated how “very disappointed” he is that Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, but hasn’t publicly stated in so many words that he wants to fire the AG. For what it’s worth, it didn’t take very long for time to tell what happened with James Comey, Marc Kasowitz, and Sean Spicer. [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/25/politics/trump-press-conference/index.html)]

* Which in-house officials make the most money? Big Law Business took a look at the summary compensation tables from the 500 largest U.S. companies ranked by revenue to figure out the answer. Take a look at the list of the 30 highest earners, gasp at their eye-popping compensation, and then wonder why you haven’t decided to move in-house yet.

* A three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit struck down Washington, D.C., regulations which required that residents prove they had a “good reason to fear injury” in order to obtain a concealed-carry permit for firearms, ruling that the carrying of firearms was a “core” Second Amendment right. The District may seek an en banc review of the decision. [[BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/a-dc-federal-court-just-ruled-carrying-guns-in-public-is-a?utm_term=.xiAxPDpNx#.exWEPqnWE)]

* “There is not a law firm function that happens without alcohol” Do law firms enable alcoholism? In a word, yes — and the fact that we still have to ask ourselves this when one-third of attorneys have admitted that they drink too much and even more have admitted that they have a serious drinking problem is simply appalling.
