# Peering Into Biglaw’s Crystal Ball
## Elevate sees the legal market much as Caesar saw Gaul: in three parts.

If you want a glimpse of what private law may look like in 2030, check out the work being done at [Elevate](https://elevateservices.com/). The alternative legal service provider (“ALSP”) has been on a tear of late, and it’s got a vision for the shape of the legal marketplace that merits attention. Luckily for me, members of Elevate’s senior leadership, including CEO Liam Brown and President John Croft were willing to sit down and discuss that vision with me recently.

The elevator pitch for Elevate is simple, according to Brown: “We’re [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en?c=us_us_brand_10460943&n=psgs_brand_1218&&c=ad_usadfy17_10000001&n=psgs_Brand-%7c-US-%7c-Exact_accenture&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIh-mq6OCD6AIVhshkCh2iRQsQEAAYASAAEgIWa_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) for law.” Elevate operates as a consulting group working with both in-house legal departments and private law firms on long-term strategy issues, technology selection, workflow design, legal-spend planning, and most any other kind of problem a legal team might need to address. So far, so normal. Where Elevate gets interesting is in its basic conception of the legal marketplace, and its vision for how to break down that concept going forward.

The Three Camps

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Elevate sees the legal market broken into three camps: law firms, law companies, and law departments. Law firms are self-explanatory; collections of licensed attorneys whose primary focus is providing clients legal advice. Law companies are what most would call ALSPs. Law companies focus on providing their clients with business solutions to problems that include a legal dimension. Law departments are the in-house interface point for law firms and law companies, and provide their parent company legal advice, strategy, and business solutions.

Elevate’s fundamental insight is that, although each of these three types of organizations is different, the people who make them up are fundamentally the same. Per Brown, “when you think about the sort of tribe of people, whether or not you work at a law company, a law department, or a law firm today, those people are just delivering differently for customers. We’re all kind of sort of part of this tribe of people that are really trying to make a dent in the universe.”

Given that the members of these organizations are generally like-minded, it makes little sense not to attempt to leverage that by working together. Elevate’s goal, then, is to fuzz the traditional hard lines between law companies like itself and the law firms and law departments it works with. “Instead of there being this bright line where law firms do all of these things and then law companies do all of those things and they never cross, law firms and law companies actually collaborate on one area.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Elevate’s effort to fuzz the lines between ALSP and law firms is in full swing. In the UK, where ownership of law firms isn’t limited to attorneys, Elevate purchased a midsize firm called Halebury outright. While the entities remain separate, their unified ownership means that Elevate can effectively cover the entire spectrum of legal services. There’s no reason Halebury attorneys wouldn’t want to freely collaborate with Elevate professional staff, because every dollar earned and good result achieved flows back to Elevate itself.

In the US and elsewhere, where law firm ownership remains restricted to licensed attorneys, Elevate has partnered closely with independent Biglaw firms. According to Elevate’s recent presentation at the legal-oriented SOLID West Conference, its team-up with international powerhouse Hogan Lovells is paying off in big ways.

For example, as you’re probably aware, the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) has long been the standard benchmark interest rate. It’s omnipresent in transactional contracts. LIBOR is being discontinued in 2021, and the administrative headache of managing the transition is staggering. Hogan Lovells set out to become a one-stop shop for clients dealing with that transition. Rather than build it from the ground up, Hogan Lovells brought in Elevate’s technical and consulting expertise to build its tool, which ended up making the program 50% more efficient than Hogan Lovell’s traditional law firm model would have been.

In a similar vein, Hogan Lovells turned to Elevate to help it build a flexible lawyer resourcing center. As John Croft put it, “if you look at the shape of any law firm, what are the chances that the client needs the exact mix of people the firm employs on any given day? The answer is 0%. If you wander around a law firm, either there are people sitting around doing nothing or there are people pulling all-nighters and working all weekend.”

Hogan Lovells could have built its own staffing program from the ground up. Instead, it collaborated with Elevate, which had already built its own flexible legal staffing center in Phoenix. Elevate used that expertise and infrastructure to help Hogan Lovells build its own captive law firm to provide low cost virtual services to its clients, which ended up reducing Hogan Lovell’s overhead on the project by 57%, cutting down the break-even point of the project dramatically.

To A Better, More Profitable Future

Under conventional thinking, what Elevate is doing is crazy. It’s helping one of its competitors provide better and broader customer service at lower prices. But by getting out of the competitive mindset, and by being willing to fuzz the lines and see each other as collaborators rather than enemies, Hogan Lovell and Elevate have to date brought in $40million in revenue they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to get.

While breaking down the traditional lines between lawyers and other legal professionals may seem threatening to those of us with JDs, in Brown’s experience the collaborative approach has improved the lives of the lawyers working with Elevate. According to Brown, marrying ALSPs and law firms has meant unbundling Elevate’s lawyers from the lower-tier work, “the cluster of email in their inbox that would turn up on a Thursday evening when they were leaving to pick up their kids from football practice.” In Elevate’s vision, lawyers spend less time on busy work and more time where they’re most valuable, analyzing law and advising clients.

Elevate’s vision is a strong one. I’ve long said that law firms looking to remain competitive in the coming economy will need to find new ways to deliver value at reduced costs. Partnering with ALSPs, rather than competing with them, is a strong play in that direction. Both players bring different strengths to the table, and both stand to win by bringing onboard clients they couldn’t land separately.

Collaboration, instead of competition, can lift up everybody.

# Why Toxic Culture Is To Blame For Women Leaving Law Firms 
## The callous disregard and lack of respect for women lawyers and lawyer moms needs to stop.

Last week, my LinkedIn newsfeed was filled with words of disdain, anger, and frustration from fellow women lawyers and lawyer moms about the sexist and despicable [text message](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kelleyjbarnett_there-is-an-unpleasant-truth-about-law-firm-activity-7018252672885538816-mBdV/) a male partner sent to a woman lawyer. She had just returned from maternity leave and notified the firm that she was resigning and joining another firm. Notably, the LinkedIn post referenced that the new mother had been “asked and [was] expected to perform legal work” while out on maternity leave.

The text message referenced in the post stated, “What you did – collecting salary from the firm while sitting on your ass, except to find time to interview for another job – says everything one needs to know about your character. Karma’s a bitch. Rest assured, regarding anyone who inquires, they will hear the truth from me about what a soul-less and morally bankrupt person you are.”

The LinkedIn post quickly gained millions of views as other women lawyers chimed in, sharing their tough pregnancies and subsequent harsh maternity experiences. For example, Emily Hirsekorn, a lawyer and career leadership coach, [mentioned how she endured severe health issues](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emilyhirsekorn_womenlawyers-confidentleadership-careerconfidencecoach-activity-7019304715700092928-ECi0?) following delivery of her sons and how those issues further impacted her while on maternity leave. Elaine Spector, a patent lawyer, [posted in solidarity about her pregnancy](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elaine-p-spector_momlawyers-womeninlaw-womeninip-activity-7018987283055812609-2zoe/) and subsequent harsh recovery. Both of these posts and countless others sent a very loud and clear message: maternity leave is definitely not “sitting on your ass.”

The firm that employed the sender of the text, Zashin & Rich, published a since-deleted post on its LinkedIn page, “That single text was sent in the heat of the moment by an employee upset by the belief that the former colleague while on paid leave sought employment with another law firm.” A second [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zashin-%26-rich-co.-l.p.a._this-statement-is-from-stephen-zashin-co-managing-activity-7018734371432001537-XOrM/) surfaced, noting that Jon Dileno (the lawyer who sent the vitriolic text) was no longer with the firm.

Seeing Dileno’s words in print in the year 2023 quickly brought me back to my own experiences as a young female associate in the early 2000s where I endured similar inappropriate, crude, and unprofessional verbal and written words by male partners. The legal profession chants about diversity in law firms, yet continues to permeate a culture where women are treated and seen as less than.

The fact that this woman lawyer was being asked to perform work while on maternity leave also shows the firm’s tone-deaf nature. What if she was a high-risk pregnancy? What if she suffered complications during childbirth and after?

Clearly, the firm missed the memo on proper protocols, which is rather ironic considering its main practice area is labor and employment and family law. Instead, it conducted damage control, and publicized that the offending lawyer was removed from the firm. Still, the damage had been done.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In a 2022 [survey of Women Leaving the Law](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/Women-Leaving-Law-Final.pdf) developed by Leopard Solutions, more than 80% of women surveyed cited a lack of flexibility in the work environment and work-life balance as the reasons for leaving a top 200 law firm. More than 70% of respondents said the trajectory of their careers drove them to move (i.e., no advancement opportunities). The most startling statistic: 90% of women noted being frustrated with the support they had received from their law firms. The report mentioned steps for law firms to “retain and elevate women,” which included a zero-tolerance policy for sexism, uncovering unconscious bias, offering equal paternity care, and acknowledging women’s successes.

[Elena Deutsch](https://womeninterestedinleavinglaw.com/), a coach and founder of WILL — Women Interested in Leaving (big) Law — is no stranger to these statistics. Many of the women lawyer clients Deutsch works with suffer from anxiety, depression, and burnout due to the toxic shaming. “This recent story glaringly exposes tensions that live right under the surface for women lawyers. Miscarriages are common among the women I work with. The stress of (big) law demands take a toll on every organ of the body, including hair loss, horrific skin rashes, GI, vision, and dental issues.”

As I’ve [previously written](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/why-women-lawyers-need-to-push-harder-than-ever-for-equality/) in my column, the bigger issue is our profession has allowed this toxic culture to permeate throughout law firms without any action taken by the American Bar Association or other governing bodies. In one of my articles from 2021, I referenced an [ABA Journal article](https://www.abajournal.com/columns/article/are-women-lawyers-paying-enough-attention-to-upward-mobility) that suggested women lawyers become anti-family in order to be pro-career.

While Dileno likely never anticipated that his gross and misogynistic text message would reach public virality, I’m willing to bet he doesn’t send male counterparts those types of texts, and I’m also willing to bet it’s not his first rodeo in sending these types of communications to female lawyers. It’s also why women lawyers are consistently facing heavier restraints on their legal careers, including the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic brought to light. There’s often a longstanding pattern of this type of conduct that’s merely swept under the rug by firms with a chuckle among the “old boys’ club.”

But the bigger message is this: in today’s workforce, women are no longer remaining silent and in fear of men who harass, humiliate, and berate their character or their work. “Her courage opens a whole new world of connection and honesty for all of us,” says Deutsch.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
The callous disregard and lack of respect for women lawyers and lawyer moms needs to stop. The legal profession as a whole needs to do better and be better — and act immediately. Diversity and inclusion are mere puffery unless you’re willing to put in the actual work and stand by it.

To the women lawyers who’ve fallen prey to the ongoing sexism and misogyny in law firms, remember that your [law degree opens many doors and opportunities](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/finding-your-own-career-happiness-and-path-to-success-in-law/) for you to thrive — a toxic law firm culture doesn’t need to be your end point.

To the female lawyer who received this egregious text and others who might be enduring the same horrific treatment, I hope your next career stop is one that brings you unwavering respect and happiness.

# January 2 Is Going To Be One Of The Busiest Days Of The Year
## Attorneys and staff can employ certain strategies to make this time less hectic for everyone involved.

The legal industry, like many other things in life, follows cycles — busy, then slow, then back to busy. The holiday season is usually one of the slowest times of the year; people are off for vacations, and courts rarely schedule matters around Christmas and New Year’s Day. However, right after New Year’s Day is usually one of the busiest seasons for lawyers, with January 2 usually one of the busiest days of the year for attorneys. In certain instances, attorneys and staff can employ certain strategies to make this time less hectic for everyone involved.

Hold Off

Lawyers and staff typically have long-term projects that can be completed on an indeterminate schedule. It is usually wise not to complete such assignments during busy periods like the week immediately following New Year’s Day. Moreover, sometimes attorneys need to check in with other attorneys or stakeholders periodically throughout the year. It might be best to hold off on such checks until a reasonable amount of time after New Year’s Day since communications can be lost in the shuffle if they are conveyed shortly into the new year.

Wait Until The Afternoon

Each year, I am surprised at the volume of calls I receive on the morning of January 2. It’s as if people have thought about reaching out to me throughout the holiday season, and once 9 a.m. on January 2 rolls around, the calls flood in. The problem is that it can be difficult to return such a volume of calls, especially around this time. Things can get lost in the shuffle if lawyers are overburdened during a particularly hectic time of the year.

Waiting to call sometime even until later in the day on January 2 can have benefits. In addition to avoiding situations where a request or communication is lost in the shuffle of a lawyer trying to do to much, it can help ensure people are not overburdened with tasks when things return to normal after the holiday season and enable them to meaningfully respond to work matters.

Respect Vacations

Many people may wish to take January 2 off even though it is the first business day of the new year. Since people will have New Year’s Day off (a Monday this time), taking the Tuesday off as well will allow people to enjoy a four-day weekend. In addition, some people who are traveling for vacation may not want to return in time to be able to perform work tasks for January 2. This could be due to the elevated travel costs (in time and sanity, not just the monetary hit) associated with the season or family plans that just make it easier to return to work at a later time.

Workplaces can embrace people taking January 2 off if this is convenient for employees. Having fewer people performing work right as the new year begins can result in fewer tasks for people in the office. Such a tactic also shows the type of leniency that employees appreciate when they evaluate their employers and can go a long way toward boosting morale around the office.

All told, people should brace for the increase in business everyone will need to confront when the holiday season is over and most people go back to work on January 2. However, if employers and staff follow some strategies, they can make it easier for everyone to handle the busy days and weeks that usually occur in the new year.

# Bad News For Junior Partners With No Book Of Business: You Don't Have Many Options
## Just don't burn any bridges yet.

As the autumn gives way to the winter, the mind of every unfulfilled attorney turns to lateral moves. Like a siren’s song, the thought of what could be at another law firm dances in the mind… right after your end-of-the-year bonus check clears.

At The Recorder, Julie Brush, founder and author of [The Lawyer Whisperer](http://www.thelawyerwhisperer.com), has a career advice column, and [this week’s offering ](https://www.law.com/sites/therecorder/2017/11/20/how-marketable-is-a-junior-law-firm-partner-with-no-book-of-business/)takes a question from a junior partner looking to make some moves:

I’m a junior litigation partner at a mid-sized law firm. I have great credentials and trial experience, but no portable book of business. Will I be able to “upgrade” to a big firm as a partner?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Yeah… as you might imagine, without a book of business, making a move — at least with the title of partner — is going to be a challenge. “Demand for legal services is flat” has[ become a refrain](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/top-firms-build-bigger-gap-over-the-field-like-they-do-every-quarter/) over the last few years, and the way the biggest law firms have continued to thrive is by employing lawyers who inspire loyalty in their clients. So, without clients that will follow you… do you even partner, bro?

Brush puts a similar kibosh on the letter writer’s dreams of Biglaw glory:

As a junior partner without a book of business, your options with Big Law will be limited. So as you begin your search process, your expectations should be managed around this current market reality. With this said, not every firm will necessarily see a young service partner as persona non grata.

Of course, as Brush notes, it is still possible to move firms… especially if you’re comfortable with a downgrade to a title of counsel. And anything on your résumé that can make you stand out — like extensive first-chair trial experience — increases the likelihood a Biglaw shop will take a chance on a service partner.

# The Sad Truth One Stat Reveals About The Legal Industry

Sometimes you hear a random factoid that just kind of sticks with you. Something about the way the fact is framed or the texture it (perhaps, inadvertently) provides makes it resonate. Such was the case of one statistic I heard during the [Legal Marketing Association’s annual meeting](http://www.legalmarketing.org/conference) this week in Austin, TX. In a breakout session, led by [Bill Josten](http://blog.legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/author/william-josten/) of Thomson Reuters Westlaw, designed to help marketing and business development professionals translate their message into “lawyer speak,” he dropped this bomb:

Only 49% of law firms are teaching their attorneys how to talk to clients about pricing.

… which means more than half of firms aren’t talking about it. Taken from the [Altman Weil 2014 Law Firms in Transition](http://www.altmanweil.com/dir_docs/resource/f68236ab-d51f-4d81-8172-96e8d47387e3_document.pdf) survey, Josten agrees this is a disturbing stat that demonstrates how slow to change law firms are. And it tells us a few important truths about the future of the legal industry.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
First of all, this is why alternate fee agreements are here to stay, and the firms that are best able to respond to this market reality will be the most successful in the future. If clients are unable to talk with the lawyers they work with on a day-to-day basis about their bills, they will never buy into the value proposition of traditional hourly billing. We know that [firms are under pressure](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/4-key-lessons-on-the-state-of-legal-marketing-and-business-development/) to develop new billing models, and cutting off the majority of people who are actually doing the billing from that conversation seems counterproductive.

It also begs the question: Why aren’t firms teaching or at least talking about this? There are a couple of theories. One is the black box syndrome. Plenty of firms get their rocks off by keeping secrets, and sure, being tight-lipped when it comes to client confidences is paramount, but the inner workings of the firm that associates work for are often hidden from them. Which never seems to benefit the associates with boots on the ground. Quick question for all the associates reading this: do you know what rate your firm bills you out at? Do you know how many of your hours have been written off by a partner eager to appease a client? At the LMA session, Josten explained that this lack of transparency can really hurt your chances when trying to get promoted.

Perhaps firms are afraid the secret (billing) sauce will get out when attorneys leave the firm. Biglaw is based on a model of churning through associates, no matter how big the summer class is; by the time the eighth year rolls around, there aren’t more than a handful still around. So it may make sense they don’t want their pricing information going to competitors with each lateral move, but what this really shows is how dispensable associates are to their firm. Sure, they’ll gladly take those 2400 hours you’ve billed (what were you going to do with them anyway, live your life?), but they don’t trust you. You are a cog there to finance someone else’s vacation home, and this opacity is just another example of that fact.

The other issue with law firms not teaching associates about billing: firms, and Biglaw in particular, aren’t great about teaching much of anything. If it isn’t in the form of a redline, don’t expect to get much feedback from a partner. Older associates may take pity on a n00b and explain how something is done, but often times they’ll just take on the task themselves and finish in half the time. Some law firm vets probably aren’t even surprised by this fact; it is, after all, just more of the same.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Firms must just think that associates are not worth training on firm pricing. First-year associates aren’t usually alone in a room with a client, so why bother trying to teach them anything about the business of law? It is this cynical perspective that associates, particularly naïve ones just starting off their careers, need to be aware of, before it bites them in the behind. Rather than invest in their attorneys, firms have walled off pricing, [increasingly creating](http://images.about.bna.com/Web/BloombergBNA/%7B171efa92-ebe7-41bd-80ec-1e35da75d8d7%7D_Bloomberg_Law_BizDev_LMA_Survey_Report_0416.pdf) a specialized department and positions to fill the role.

As much as the knowledge may be valuable to the ultimate career trajectory of an individual associate, from the firm’s perspective (one that keeps PPP in the forefront of everything it does), every minute an associate spends learning about the underlying superstructure of the law firm model is one they aren’t billing.

The only good associate is a billing one.

# Lawyers At Am Law 200 Firm Looking At Pay Cuts Of Up To 30 Percent

As another hour goes by, another Biglaw firm announces that it’s taking cost-cutting measures to alleviate the pressures that have been foisted upon it by the worldwide coronavirus outbreak. From [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/) to [furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/law-firm-uses-furloughs-layoffs-and-salary-cuts-to-make-it-through-covid-19/) to [salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-cuts-partner-pay-entirely-associate-salaries-by-25-percent/), we’ve seen it all as COVID-19 continues its devastation of the legal profession.

Sources say the latest firm to announce salary cuts is Arent Fox, which has reportedly reduced salaries for counsel by 30 percent and associates by 25 percent. These are the largest pay cuts we’ve seen yet. This information was given to employees by phone, so no memo exists. We’re told that equity partners will be taking reduced distributions, but percentages were not disclosed. One unhappy associate noted that while the calls about the salary cuts stressed the importance of everyone at the firm being in this together, “associates and counsel seem to be a little more in this than others.”

UPDATE (6:45 p.m.): Other sources at Arent Fox contacted Above the Law with the following details: equity partner distributions were reduced by 60 percent this month, and nonequity partners will be taking the same 30 percent reduction in pay as counsel. In addition, staff will receive the same 25 percent pay cut as associates. Arent Fox partners are, in fact, taking a big hit — and so are staff members.

We reached out to Arent Fox for confirmation of the salary cuts, and a spokesperson said these measures were taken in order to put the firm in a “strong position”:

As a result of the economic disruption caused by COVID-19, Arent Fox has made temporary adjustments to its business operations. We recognize the biggest mistake we can make is to underestimate the scope of this pandemic. In response to the economic slowdown, the firm is instituting a temporary pay cut for all attorneys, professionals, and staff.

The range of legal issues, regulatory challenges, and policy changes unfolding during this crisis are historic. Our goal is to put Arent Fox in a strong position so that we can continue to provide critical, first-rate service to our clients as we help them navigate these challenges.

We hope this means the firm is able to avoid layoffs or furloughs if this pandemic goes on for longer than expected.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# What Does The Senate Have In Common With Biglaw?

Like most Americans, any time I spent watching the impeachment proceedings frustrated me.

We can’t buy a principle in a world of partisanship.

What are the standards for impeachment? The views of all senators are now 180 degrees removed from their own standards of 20 years ago. Should there be witnesses at an impeachment hearing? The views of virtually all senators are now 180 degrees removed from their own standards of 20 years ago.  Should the decision to impeach be bipartisan?  The views of all senators are now 180 degrees removed from their own standards of 20 years ago.

Are you a deficit hawk?

Depends on who’s in office.

Are you in favor of free trade?

Depends on who’s in office.

It makes you want to scream.

Just before I screamed, I saw an objection to a motion to recover attorneys’ fees. Fees were recoverable; the sole question was the amount of fees.

And instead of screaming, I came to a realization.

I realized that Biglaw has this in common with the Senate: The only principle is whose ox is being gored.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The big, flabby firm that had been working the case got religion. The big firm had assigned unnecessary lawyers to the case, staffed stuff with lawyers that could have been done by paralegals, used senior associates where juniors would have sufficed, and blown through estimated fees. But then the firm saw the other side’s motion to recover attorneys’ fees.

“The other side wants how much in fees? That’s an outrage! Look at what they did! They staffed the case with way too many lawyers. Many tasks that should have been handled by paralegals were done by lawyers; that’s ridiculous.  They used senior associates where juniors would have sufficed. They estimated the experts’ fees wouldn’t exceed one million, and ultimately it cost two. Where’s the cost control? Write it up, guys; we have to object to this!”

The arguments of lawyers, of course, unlike those of senators, are supposed to bend to fit the situation.

But I still couldn’t stop shaking my head.

It’s Day Two of the Legal Marketing Association’s annual conference. After a full day yesterday, today brings another day of content that will send legal marketers back to their firms recharged, inspired, and ready to go “all in.”

Here’s a guide to making the most of your last day.

- Lunch: 11:30 a.m. to 12:45 p.m.
The Critical Client Perspective: Legal marketers must understand the pressures, problems and protocols of their firms’ clients. We kick off today with a candid discussion with lawyers from Google, Cineplex Entertainment, NuVasive, and Padres; they will discuss innovation within their own legal departments; share how law firms can better support them; and provide insight on the everyday business issues they face.

The [In-House Counsel Panel](https://lma24.legalmarketing.org/Program/Detailed-Program?session=821f6971-8ff5-4c14-9f87-34390bd344b6) immediately follows the LMA Annual Meeting at 8 a.m. in the Grand Ballroom 5.

Advice for All:

- Download the app – “LMA Annual Conference 2024” on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. From there, you can organize your agenda, connect with other attendees, and collect contact information.
- If you feel torn between two sessions, don’t fret: Attendees will receive access to the Recordings Bundle for breakout session recordings.
- Focus your networking time: During lunch, join a table for a Shared Interest Group (SIG) that matters to you. (You do not need to be a member to join.) On Friday, there will be dedicated tables for the Solo/Small Team SIG, the Marketing Technology SIG, the PR & Communications SIG, and the Client Value SIG.

In financial industry legal news this week, it’s been (almost) all about artificial intelligence, the frenzy for which has reignited the initial public offering market.

All three of the big recent debutantes are, in their way, AI plays, none more so than chip designer Arm, which raised nearly $5 billion in the biggest stock-market debut since late 2021.

Machine-learning madness hasn’t just revived interest in tech IPOs, which have been on ice for two years, but new listings generally — perhaps, anyway.

Less welcome is the taxman’s investment in AI, with the Internal Revenue Service planning to sic its fancy new computers on partnerships, using them to pick 75 unlucky hedge funds, real-estate partnerships, and law firms, among others, for some unwanted extra scrutiny.

That comes as AI’s brain trust spent a few days in Washington promising to brush their teeth and eat their vegetables, while also trying to mold the coming regulatory crackdown to their liking, even as generative AI arrives on Wall Street and on lawyers’ desks.

# Was This Judge's Reprimand Of Kirkland & Ellis Justified?
## Everyone loves a good benchslap, but not all benchslaps are good.

Yesterday we wrote about a [harsh benchslap](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/judge-reams-junior-associate-because-biglaw-firm-refused-to-send-a-partner-to-court/) that Judge Nicholas Garaufis (E.D.N.Y.) inflicted upon a third-year associate at [Kirkland & Ellis](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/kirkland-ellis/). Judge Garaufis was incensed over the fact that K&E sent an associate rather than a partner to cover the initial status conference in the case, an action against Facebook claiming that the social media giant facilitates terrorism by allowing terrorists to use its services.

The partner couldn’t attend because he was called away to Texas on another case. This didn’t sit well with Judge Garaufis, who took it out on K&E associate [Aulden Burcher-DuPont](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=11515). We now have the [full transcript](http://nylawyer.nylj.com/adgifs/decisions16/092616transcript.pdf), whose relevant sections we will now share (all emphases added).

THE COURT: How long have you been with this law firm?

MR. BURCHER: One year, your Honor.

THE COURT: One year: I don’t disparage your brilliance. I’m sorry. Kirkland & Ellis sent a first-year associate to United States District Court to talk to a federal district judge about this case.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Burcher is actually a third-year associate — he graduated from Penn Law in 2013 and worked at Mayer Brown from 2013 to 2015, before lateraling over to Kirkland — but anyway….

THE COURT: You are admitted in this court, right?

MR. BURCHER: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: Right. You are admitted. You tell your folks back at Kirkland & Ellis that I don’t much like the idea that they think so little of this court that they didn’t send a partner here to talk about this kind of a problem which implicates international terrorism and the murder of innocent people in Israel and other places.

MR. BURCHER: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: No. Don’t say anything else. I think it is outrageous and irresponsible and insulting and you’re not the person doing the insulting. It’s whoever sent you here. Facebook pays millions of dollars to lawyers. This is a real problem. Whether I can solve it judicially is problematical perhaps. But I want to talk to someone who talks to the senior management of FaceBook. Next time they send a partner.

MR. BURCHER: Yes, your Honor. The other lead attorney in this matter was called away earlier this week — as we communicated to opposing counsel — that there was an emergency hearing in the State of Texas.

THE COURT: They do a lot of things in Texas that I don’t really like very much either. So I’m not impressed that Kirkland & Ellis, a law firm with how many thousand people in it, two, five? How many thousand lawyers are there at Kirkland & Ellis?

MR. BURCHER: I believe there are approximately fifteen hundred, your Honor.

THE COURT: Fifteen hundred people. How many of them are partners in litigation? You don’t even know, there are so many. It’s not a good start, you can tell your exalted partners over there, that they put you here and I’ve got to lecture you. I want to lecture them.

I’ve been a lawyer for 41 years and I’ve been a judge or 16 years and I’m not having this discussion with you. I’m going to set another date for a pre-motion conference and you better be sure that a partner of your law firm shows up here.

MR. BURCHER: Yes, your Honor.

He then directed the parties to return on September 27 for a follow-up conference, snarkily saying that “maybe Kirkland & Ellis can scrounge up a partner who is not busy with working on some project in Texas to come see a lowly United States District Judge in the Eastern District of New York on that day.”

Discussing the case [yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/judge-reams-junior-associate-because-biglaw-firm-refused-to-send-a-partner-to-court/?rf=1), my colleague Kathryn Rubino wrote that the judge “probably had every right to be pissed off at Biglaw powerhouse Kirkland & Ellis” and concluded her post as follows: “Lesson to Biglaw: don’t send an associate to do a partner’s job.”

From Pilot and Above The Law  
I respectfully dissent. In my view, Judge Garaufis was out of line. In demanding that a K&E partner cover this conference, he comes across as an insecure judicial diva with a giant chip on his shoulder. A few points, in no particular order (and with thanks to some of my [Facebook friends](https://www.facebook.com/davidlat) who shared their insights, whom I have quoted below):

1. This was just a routine status conference. Assuming that Burcher was properly briefed — and we never got the chance to find out if he was, because Judge Garaufis refused to engage Burcher on anything of substance — he could easily have handled the scheduling and administrative issues typically handled at such a conference. If a fifth-year associate can [argue before the Supreme Court](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/a-biglaw-associates-supreme-court-debut/), surely a third-year associate can handle a status conference in district court.

(It’s true, as you can see from the [full transcript](http://nylawyer.nylj.com/adgifs/decisions16/092616transcript.pdf), that there was a fair amount of discussion of substantive legal issues at the conference. But it struck me as discussion held because Judge Garaufis likes to hear the sound of his own voice, as opposed to discussion of substantive law necessary to resolve the matters you’d expect to be discussed at a status conference.)

UPDATE (1:45 p.m.): A source close to the case adds that the two sides in this case have a good working relationship, had worked out what needed to be worked out, and had no disputed issues to be resolved at the hearing.

2. Judges should encourage appearances by younger lawyers. As one of my friends quipped, “And people wonder why associates can’t get any court experience!” Compare Judge Garaufis to former Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal — now an in-house lawyer at Facebook, actually — who [actively encouraged law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/proof-that-law-firms-dont-really-care-about-associate-development/) to give associates some court time when he was on the bench.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
UPDATE (3:20 p.m.): Per John Marzulli of the New York Daily News, Facebook brought deputy general counsel Grewal [in from California](https://twitter.com/marzullij/status/780844018926100480) for the follow-up hearing; how perfect is that? Also present, coming up from D.C.: Kirkland partner partner [Craig Primis](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=8994).

3. There was no need to be nasty about it. Even if Judge Garaufis was justified in requiring a partner’s presence, he didn’t need to do it in such a snide and sarcastic manner. He could simply have asked the parties to come in for a conference on a later date (which he eventually did, after all the berating of poor Aulden Burcher-DuPont).

One friend of mine wondered whether Judge Garaufis’s local rules say anything about who must appear at status conference. If they did, I would have expected him to say something about it; upon my quick review of [his rules](http://nylawyer.nylj.com/adgifs/decisions16/092616transcript.pdf), they do not.

In hindsight, would it have been better for Kirkland to have sent some other partner, even one without knowledge of this case, to “second chair” the associate? Sure — but I don’t think that was necessary. Aulden Burcher-DuPont is a duly admitted member of the Eastern District of New York bar, and assuming no objection from the client, he is fully entitled to represent his client in that court (just as many young lawyers who are solo practitioners or at smaller firms regularly do). As one friend of mine quipped, “I was unaware that either a license to practice law or an admission to a court included a designation of whether that attorney was a partner or an associate.”

I like this suggestion from another friend of mine: “I think it would be a nice touch if at the next hearing the associate appeared for Facebook again, except this time with FB General Counsel at his side, and that GC should make a show of letting the associate do all the talking.” Or this one: “If I was the partner, I’d show up at the next meeting with every single K&E partner that I could beg or bully into coming and make it clear that they were all there to show the firm’s full support for the associate and their capacity to represent the firm’s clients zealously, ethically, and competently.”

What does Kirkland & Ellis think of all this? We reached out to K&E for comment; the firm’s spokesperson referred us to Facebook’s spokesperson, whom we are waiting to hear back from.

UPDATE (1:33 p.m.): Here is a statement from Facebook (about the substance of the lawsuit, as opposed to who represented the company in court last week): “We are committed to providing a service where people feel safe when using Facebook. Our Community Standards make clear that there is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity, and we take swift action to remove this content when it’s reported to us. We sympathize with the victims of these horrible crimes.”

The follow-up status conference takes place today at 2:30 p.m., so we may have another report for you later.

UPDATE (8:30 p.m.): Here’s what happened [at this afternoon’s hearing](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/judge-garaufis-placated-by-kirkland-ellis-and-facebook/).

UPDATE (9/28/2016, 1:30 p.m.): Neither Kirkland nor Facebook has said a bad word about Judge Garaufis, but not everyone who appears before him shows such restraint. Over at the [Robing Room](http://www.therobingroom.com/Judge.aspx?ID=8#comments), he has an average rating of 3.8 (out of 10).

What do you think of Judge Garaufis’s smackdown of K&E? Please vote in our poll:

Was Judge Garaufis's reprimand of Kirkland and Ellis appropriate?

- Yes - the firm should have sent a partner.
- No - it was inappropriate and uncalled-for.

# Seward & Kissel Designs World's Longest Miniature Golf Hole
## A law firm tradition unlike any other.

Firms struggling to find the balance that brings folks back to the office to reap the benefits of collaborative work while providing the market-demanded flexibility of work-from-home schedules have flirted with [mandatory office attendance days](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firms-three-day-office-workweek-descending-into-paranoid-surveillance/) and even [withholding bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/want-your-full-biglaw-bonus-better-get-back-to-the-office/). But maybe the easier solution is just… making the office an enjoyable place to be?

Seward & Kissel takes the latter approach and they’re going above and beyond to build that enjoyable office community.

The inaugural Seward & Kissel Golf Open featured roughly 100 golfers competing across all six floors of the firm’s New York office. Each floor took responsibility for designing the holes in their space, with one floor going so far as to contact the folks from Guinness to figure out the longest miniature golf hole in the world… and top it. For the record, Seward & Kissel’s 508-foot hole topped the mark, though as a non-commercial course, it’s ineligible to be enshrined as the new record holder.

And it all came together because partner [Steven Nadel](https://www.sewkis.com/people/steven-nadel/) observed the same hybrid work pressures the rest of the industry deals with. “We’ve tried over the years… during COVID you had all these half-baked attempts to bring everyone together like wine tastings or movie nights, but they don’t resonate because some people just don’t want to do them. We wanted to come up with something different, super fun, that put everyone on equal footing so everyone could participate.”

Nadel had organized a putting competition for his floor as a summer event in 2018, offering a rolling prize for making a long-distance putt. When he began working on something for the end of the year, someone reminded him of how much fun they had with that event, and Nadel resolved to take it to another level.

As he put it, “I’m a big believer in thinking big.”

As a community-building exercise, the event energized the firm beyond the day of the event. Nadel reported folks going out on their own time to purchase more decorations and the mail room staff showing off their hole-engineering efforts.



Awards were given for the top five golfers, best dressed, and for the floor with the best designed hole. Firm veteran legal secretary Linda Skalacki took top honors and the trophy, which I’m not sure has a name but we’ll just call it the Seward Cup for now.



When it comes to bringing an office together, there are a lot of firms eyeing top-down, punishment-based models to get everyone back. But what firms really need are leaders with a philosophy like Nadel’s: “It’s just as easy to be nice and fun.”

# Your Job Search Isn’t An OpenTable Reservation
## Put your best face forward and treat your interview process as if your reputation is on the line.

We’ve all been there — you’re making plans with friends and you can’t decide between the fancy new Italian place and the hipster burger spot. The solution? Make two reservations and decide later — or cancel both altogether and opt for a frozen pizza, so you don’t have to leave the couch. But this process isn’t just making the act of booking reservations easier — it’s fundamentally changing the decision-making process itself. We now have the ability to make multiple reservations at various restaurants while preserving the option to cancel them all with the click of a button.

The ability to explore options and then defer decision-making certainly has value when it comes to deciding what’s for dinner. However, not all decisions are created equal, and “What is the next step in my career?” requires a bit more consideration than “What’s for dinner?” Despite the very different stakes in these two decisions, it is becoming commonplace for attorneys to schedule multiple interviews only to decide at the last minute that they’re only interested in pursuing a couple of their options.

The idea of scheduling a lot of interviews and then deciding later which one(s) to take or not sounds appealing and makes some sense in theory, but it’s a terrible way to treat your career. Here’s why:

- Firms are made of people, and people have egos and feelings. Whether we like it or not, lawyers are people too, and people have feelings and egos. Whether to take a job is often an emotional decision and whether to extend an interview to a candidate is also an emotional one. Some firms and lawyers take a candidate’s acceptance or rejection of an interview as a referendum on their likeability, their value in the marketplace, or how they stack up against the competition. When a candidate flatly turns the interview down for no reason at all, the reaction can be intense. You never want to burn a bridge with a potential employer because you never know what the future holds.
- Firms — and their people — have long memories. A former candidate did not receive an offer to interview with an Am Law firm because that same firm interviewed him during law school and found him to be rude. They took notes on his behavior, kept those notes in their database, and declined an interview during his third year of practice on the basis of the previous experience they had with him. If you are flaky about an interview, the firm likely remembers. Then, if in a few years you want to explore that firm as an option, chances are they won’t even look in your direction.
- Firms communicate across locations and keep very close tabs on candidates. Another candidate was uninvited to a law firm interview in Atlanta because she applied to labor and employment roles with the firm in both Atlanta and Seattle. The firm felt that she was disorganized, didn’t know her own mind, and/or wasn’t committed to Atlanta and was thus a flight risk. Be very thoughtful about which firms you apply to and why. Make sure you don’t apply to multiple offices of the same firm, unless there is a very good reason to do so.
- The legal field is a small world. Everyone knows everyone within the legal industry or is within six degrees of separation of one another, and people talk. You’ve worked very hard to create and maintain a reputation for yourself. It’s quite possible that the law firm you burn a bridge with during the recruiting process shows up as opposing counsel in your next deal or the hiring manager at a company you want to go in-house with. Also, if you are in a niche practice or a small market, you run the risk of alienating every firm in your geography and painting yourself into a corner with nowhere else to go.
Taking an interview is never a bad thing — and whether you accept the eventual job offer or not is another story entirely. You don’t have to join a firm just because you are engaging in the interview process. An interview is an opportunity to see if what you have heard about the firm is true, to find out if there is a mutual interest between you and the firm, and to meet new people. If you play your cards right, you will be expanding your network, which may lead to other jobs and speaking or writing opportunities that will further your career and positively build your reputation in the community. Interviews are fact-finding missions, where you gain a great deal of information and insight into how another firm operates. What you learn can help you make a more educated decision about the next steps in your career.

Dismissing a firm’s interview offer after submitting to the role closes you off to valuable information and potential opportunities. It also simply makes you look bad. A potential future employer (or future legal adversary) should not be dismissed in the same carefree manner you would click the cancel button on a dinner reservation. You need to put your best face forward and treat your interview process as if your reputation is on the line — because it is.

# Biglaw Firm Goes All Punitive With New, Stricter Hours Requirements To Get Bonus Money
## Get ready to bill even more in 2019.

New year, new bonus structure. That’s the word over at Cadwalader. Back [in November they announced ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-bonus-news-continues-to-impress-as-another-firm-announces-associate-bonuses/)bonuses on the market scale, assuming associates billed 1,800 hours, with a 20 percent bump for high billers. But now they’ve decided that in order to get their full bonuses during the next bonus cycle, associates will have to bill an additional 100 hours.

As one tipster notes, it was only a few years ago that Cadwalader had no hours requirement, and the latest increase seems part of a disturbing trend:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Cadwalader is already regretting its generosity and dialing back expectations for next year. The managing partner sent an email today announcing the bonus threshold will be raised by 100 hours next year.

Compounding the associate headache is the trajectory of CWT bonus policy—only a couple of years ago, the firm had no bonus minimum. So we’ve gone from no minimum to a minimum to now a higher minimum.

Yes, we know: 1,900 hours isn’t the highest threshold in the industry — far from it. But as sources point out coming off of what the firm describes as a strong year, the new rule really stings:

To be sure, 1,900 is still below a lot of peer firms and in line with the market. But that doesn’t explain why this announcement comes on the heels of talking about how CWT had such a strong year, and how partner profits in the last announced year were up — among the highest percentage jumps in the AmLaw 100. If we’re in such boom times, why cut associate benefits now? At least have the decency to wait for a recession.

Cheers to increased billing in 2019.

# World’s Richest Law Firm Announces Enormous Partner Class
## With almost 150 new partners, how many of them will enter the firm’s equity ranks?

There’s no denying that Kirkland & Ellis is one the nation’s greatest law firms. Not only does the firm offer a compelling combination of prestige, profitability, and pay (not when it comes to [special fall bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/), mind you), but now it’s once again shattering the market on partners.

Bigger is apparently better at Kirkland, because earlier this week, the firm announced its largest-ever partner class. This year, the firm welcomed a partner class of 145, up from 2019’s record class of 141, 2018’s class of 122, and 2017’s class of 97.

But how many of these new partners will enter the firm’s equity ranks? Last year, the firm had 450 equity partners and 636 nonequity partners. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/10/01/kirkland-again-tops-new-partner-promotion-record/) has some information on the firm’s tiered-partnership structure:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Kirkland is well known for its large class of nonequity partners, which helps [boost its profitability.](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202596738105/) The firm is also known for an “up or out” approach to partnership, meaning large-scale promotions to its partnership don’t make its equity class top-heavy. The firm had 450 equity partners last year, according to ALM data, among its total lawyer head count of 2,598.

The American Lawyer in 2012 found that roughly 20% of Kirkland’s income partners join the equity tier after meeting a four-year eligibility threshold. Additionally, about 43% of attorneys promoted between 2010 and 2013 were still at the firm in 2017, according to an American Lawyer report on the subject that year.

As far as diversity is concerned, Kirkland opted not to show photos of its [new partnership class](https://www.kirkland.com/news/press-release/2020/10/kirkland-announces-new-partners) (unlike last year), but from what we can tell, once again, the firm’s new partners are looking mighty male and mighty white. On the bright side, about 60 of the firm’s new partners are women (up from 46 last year), but minorities still seem to be underrepresented. You’d think that with a group of lawyers this large, a little more attention would have been paid.

It continues to be important for firms to know that these subjects won’t go unnoticed. Diversity and inclusion matter — to a firm’s current lawyers, to potential recruits, and perhaps most importantly, to clients.

# Wait -- WHO Just Raised Associate Salaries?
## We are sure, now that this firm has met the Cravath scale, all is forgiven.

This is not the kind of firm where everyone just assumed they’d have to raise associate salaries once Cravath announced their new MoneyLaw scale. Even the associates at this firm didn’t think they had much of a shot to see the big money. But they were proven wrong. Welcome to the MoneyLaw club, Sheppard Mullin.

Now that they’ve gotten their payday, it is fun to look back at some of the complaints we received about the firm from associates before the raises:

Associates here at Sheppard Mullin are following the West Coast developments closely, but we are not hopeful. Despite the consistent increase in revenue, PPP, headcount and partners telling us and recruits that we are playing with the “big boys,” the firm has been notoriously stingy when it comes to reacting to the market (i.e., last year’s bonus debacle). It’s hard to see how the partners can continue to act like and tell recruits that we are “peer” with firms the likes of OMM, Baker, PH, and Orrick. Needless to say, many associates are not placing any bets on Sheppard rising to market. This is definitely going to affect our recruiting for the next couple years until they wake up. Smh.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Can you PLEASE do a post on how Sheppard Mullin is dragging their feet…. All we got was a general memo saying they are “looking into it,” which is crap when you overhear partners saying they hope the “buzz” dies off because we are “paid too much.”

We are sure, now that they’ve met the Cravath scale, all is forgiven.

The raises apply to all U.S. offices, and summer associates are getting a raise too. The firm’s email to associates grants the raises based on levels, rather than class year, but the raises to each level track exactly with the prevailing market rate. The effective date is July 11 — 10 days later than most firms’ raises, but still pretty reasonable (we’re not talking [September](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-biglaw-behemoths-weak-sauce-raise/)).

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

# 3 Lies That Lead To Burnout
## If 2022 left you a bit exhausted, and you’re looking to avoid a repeat in 2023, here are a few lies to avoid telling yourself.

With the holidays coming to a close, and the new year just around the corner, hopefully it is too soon to be thinking about ways to prevent burnout. At the same time, if 2022 did leave you a bit exhausted, such that the time you had off wasn’t nearly enough — and you’re looking to avoid a repeat in 2023, here are a few lies to avoid telling yourself.

Lie No. 1: That To Get Things Done, You Have To Do Them Yourself

This is a lie that I use to tell myself regularly. Along with the lie that it would take too long to show someone else how to do that “thing” as well as me so it was just easier to do it myself.

So I would refuse help and then get resentful because I was doing everything myself.

And because it is difficult to do everything yourself well, I would make a mistake — and when I made a mistake, I would blame it on the fact that it was because I had to do everything myself.

If this sounds a little too familiar, then I probably don’t have to explain how this vicious cycle led to my burnout.

Don’t be like me and buy into this lie.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The truth is that more can be done if knowledge and skills are shared. More can be accomplished if the load is distributed. And contrary to the notion that delegation is self-serving, depending on the task and project, it can actually be very generous to develop others.

Lie No. 2: That Rest Is Optional

This is a lie that I still wrestle with. It is so tempting to skimp on sleep so I can get more things done, whether work-related or not. Part of the lie is telling ourselves that we can “catch up on it later” or that we don’t need that much.

For those who are guilty of this lie like me, watch Matt Walker’s Ted Talk (and read his book) on “Why We Sleep.” I don’t want to spoil the eye-opening data he shares about how sleep affects our physical and mental health or the alleged productivity we try to accomplish by not sleeping.

For those skeptics out there, consider this: if you don’t dare let your computer or cellphone go without recharging, why do you let yourself run on empty?

Lie No. 3: That Work-Life Balance Exists

First, I hate this phrase. Full stop.

I hate it because it insinuates that there is a specific equation that is correct for everyone, a one-size-fits-all garment. I also hate that it insinuates that 50/50 is the goal, and if you don’t get it 50/50, then you’re not doing it right.

Lastly, I hate it because it reflects a false reality that work is outside of life, that it is so important that it has its own category against the rest of life, when in reality, work is just a part of it.

My preference is to use the terms work-life fit and work-life shift.

I like work-life fit because it accurately describes the phenomenon of fitting work into your life in a way that works for you, in that moment, in that season, and it isn’t a specific formula.

I like work-life shift because it reflects the reality that how work fits into my life shifts constantly. It changes all the time. And just as I feel like I have a rhythm between being a mom and a lawyer, that I have a workable schedule, inevitably something changes or pops up, and I have to shift and rework the fit.

It could be as small of a shift as having to travel unexpectedly for work. It could be as large of a shift as having an infant again.

Instead of buying into the lie that work-life balance exists and wasting precious time and energy into trying to chase something that doesn’t exist or, worse, thinking that something is wrong with you because you can’t achieve that 50/50 balance, don’t.

Instead of trying to create a perfect plan or formula to “optimize” your life, which is exhausting — don’t.

Conserve that precious energy and space in your brain so that you can shift into what works for that moment, that day, that season.

Now that you know what these three lies that lead to burnout are, hopefully you can avoid them, giving yourself back some space and grace in 2023.

# A Day In The Life Of A High-Powered Biglaw Dad At An Elite Firm

Are you an attorney who thinks your day is especially difficult? If you don’t have children, you may want to think again.

Being a high-powered lawyer at an elite firm can be quite complicated, and when you add children to the mix, it can become an acutely distressing experience. Now, imagine being a partner at a firm that’s been likened to the Wachtell of the West, and add in a wife who works as a federal prosecutor. How on earth can you manage your days, much less your home life?

[Martin Estrada](https://www.mto.com/lawyers/e-martin-estrada), a litigation partner in the Los Angeles office of Munger Tolles & Olson, has gotten all of this down to an art. His wife, Kerry O’Neill, is an an assistant U.S. attorney, and his two children, David and Gabriel, have an albino gecko. He describes his workday juggle in a recent article published on [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2018/02/22/with-some-very-busy-thumbs-munger-tolles-martin-estrada-manages-his-day/). Here’s a little excerpt from Estrada’s day, which starts at about 5:45 a.m., every day:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Early Rise and Paddle Boarding I get up around 5:45 or 6. It’s usually spontaneous, but we have back-up alarm if we don’t wake up. The first thing almost always we’re on the phone checking emails that came in in the morning. I have clients in Asia and also the East Coast. I’ll shoot off a response to the emails that can be responded to quickly. Sometimes I get up earlier, like at 5. I usually run four to five miles. I sometimes swim or do stand-up paddle board. My wife and I trade off. Sometimes she’ll go to the gym or go for a walk. The kids will wake up between 6 and 6:30. …

Quick Bite and Out the Door We get them downstairs for breakfast by 7 at the very latest because we have to be out the door at 7:20. I grew up eating cereal every day of my life, so I give them cereal, nothing fancy. I kind of regret that I never got in to coffee because my family’s from Guatemala. Coffee’s a big deal there. But my dad was never in to coffee. I just don’t like the taste. My wife is always giving the full effort. Sometimes she’ll cook them eggs or something a little different. Generally my wife takes them to school. I take them maybe one day a week. The person taking the kids to school will spend more time in the morning getting ready. If I’m taking the kids to school, I’m leaving school around 8:10, 8:15, and I get to work by 9. …

Pickup Time If my wife gets the kids, and she generally is able to, I’ll leave the office between 7 and 8 to try and get home before the kids go to bed. That’s always my objective. Sometimes my wife has a board meeting or has to work late, then I’ll get the kids and that will be around 4:30 or 5. They’ll want to do something fun. We live in a cul-de-sac, so a lot of time they’ll go play some basketball or soccer or something like that. I’ll get them to unwind, get their dinner ready. I’ll set up the laptop and do some work while they’re eating, and then I’ll put them to bed.

Down for the Count The kids go to bed a lot of times at 8:30. After they have dinner, they’ll do homework or watch TV. My youngest is now into chess, so I’ll play with him. Then we have to get them to shower and brush their teeth, and that’s always like the hardest task. We like to let them read a little bit to sort of quiet the mind.

Sweet Work Usually there’s a little bit more work to do. A laptop is really essential for me and for my wife. I take mine home every day. She takes hers home every day, in order to be able to have some flexibility for the kids. Sometimes I’ll leave early for my son’s soccer or year-round baseball. To do that, I’ll need to do more work once they go to bed. My wife does the same thing. If my wife picks up the kids, she’ll need to go back on the computer to review some briefs or something like that. I’ll do that as well.

Men who work in Biglaw are often picked on because they don’t have time to spend with their children, but from the looks of it, Estrada makes the time to do so each and every day. Because getting home before his kids are asleep is always an “overriding objective” for Estrada, it’s all about teamwork in his household.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed with your work at your firm, perhaps take a cue from Martin Estrada on how to get your act together and keep it that way. Because he’s so efficient, he’s not just a super lawyer, he’s also a super dad. Congratulations!

# Paul, Weiss Backs The Hell Away From Messy FTX Litigation

FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (Matias J. Ocner/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)

The downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, came fast and furious. The now bankrupt exchange is facing mounting legal woes including investigations from the U.S. Justice Department, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, plus bankruptcy proceedings and an investor class-action lawsuit.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But, as [reported by](https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftx-founders-remarks-pose-challenge-his-lawyers-2022-11-18/) Reuters, his efforts to secure counsel may be hampered by his penchant to say… entirely too much in interviews and on Twitter. (He [told Vox](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23462333/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-effective-altruism-crypto-bahamas-philanthropy) that FTX’s downfall was based in part on “messy accounting.” He later said he did not intend the conversation to be public. And his Tweets were cited by FTX’s bankruptcy lawyer as “incessant and disruptive” in court filings.) That may mean lawyers are hesitant to represent Bankman-Fried:

“There’s this old saying that a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client. The reverse is also true. An individual who is the subject of an investigation and tries to defend themselves in the court of public opinion has a fool for a lawyer,” said Justin Danilewitz, a white-collar defense lawyer at law firm Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr.

Because a lawyer will want to vet the public narrative before it goes live:

“The basic question is who controls the story,” said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University and an expert on legal ethics. “From the lawyer’s point of view, once he or she is hired, it’s the lawyer who controls the story as far as public consumption goes.”

At least one major law firm previously linked to Bankman-Fried has exited the representation.

Paul, Weiss partner Martin Flumenbaum informed Bankman-Fried that, due to an undisclosed conflict, the firm would no longer represent him, “We informed Mr. Bankman-Fried several days ago after the filing of the FTX bankruptcy that conflicts have arisen that precluded us from representing him.”

Flumenbaum declined to describe the conflicts. A onetime lawyer for convicted financier Michael Milken, Flumenbaum is currently defending Christian Larsen, the founder and chair of crypto payment and exchange company Ripple Labs Inc, in a high-profile lawsuit filed by the SEC. His law firm represents many other financial industry clients.

So far Bankman-Fried has hired Gregory Joseph of boutique firm Joseph Hage Aaronson, and a colleague of his parents. Stanford Law professor David Mills was also added to Bankman-Fried’s legal team — [both of his parents are professors at SLS.](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/11/sbf-parents-stanford-genius-bubble.html)

# Biglaw Partner Arrested On Domestic Violence Charge
## Joshua Schiller was arrested in California last night.

This morning, [American Lawyer reported](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/01/15/boies-schiller-partner-joshua-schiller-arrested-on-domestic-violence-charge/) that Joshua Schiller, son of Boies Schiller’s Jonathan Schiller, was arrested in Ross, California, last night on a domestic violence charge.

That said, Schiller’s attorney is confident that the charges will be dropped quickly.

“I fully expect the charges to be dropped. This was a misunderstanding. There was no instance of domestic violence,” Joshua Schiller’s attorney, California-based defense attorney Douglas Horngrad said in a statement.

Horngrad also provided a joint statement from Joshua and Melissa Siebel Schiller: “This is a private matter between us. We love and respect each other. We are partners and will move beyond this together.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Still, it’s another unfortunate headline for a firm in the midst of an organizational shakeup that’s seen mass departures as it sets a new direction after years of expansion. Schiller is serving as West Coast administrative partner as the firm’s California operations were curtailed over the last year.

[Business Insider reported](https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-a-messy-transition-at-elite-law-firm-boies-schiller-2020-5) that Schiller was removed from a matter in 2017 based upon “inappropriate comments” to an associate, but this is the first such domestic violence incident.

When reached for comment, the firm said:

The Firm has been made aware of recent events related to our partner, Josh Schiller.  While we have been informed by him and his wife that this was a misunderstanding, the firm will be conducting its own review to better understand what happened. While that review is ongoing, Josh has asked for a leave of absence to focus on his family, and we have agreed to give him this time.

# Kasowitz Sought TRO In Fee Dispute... Failed To Get TRO In Fee Dispute

Just before ringing in the new year, Kasowitz filed a lawsuit against Glenn Agre — a boutique law firm formed by former Kasowitz attorneys. At issue is a “success fee” pledged by a client that engaged the Glenn Agre attorneys while they worked at Kasowitz, and then followed the group to Glenn Agre where the client ultimately achieved “success.” After negotiating a fee split over the course of several weeks, Kasowitz went ahead and sued.

And sought a TRO…

Over money.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Savor that one for a second. This is one of those arguments that litigators dream about opposing but never get to because no one ever seriously tries to make it. So congratulations to whichever Glenn Agre attorneys fulfilled a lifelong dream by writing this paragraph:

This action involves a dispute between Glenn Agre and Kasowitz Benson over their respective shares of a success fee secured by Glenn Agre on behalf of its client (the “Client”), which formerly was represented by Kasowitz Benson. In short, this is a commercial dispute over money. Nothing more. Nevertheless, Kasowitz Benson seeks the extraordinary remedy of a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction enjoining disbursement of the success fee—even though Glenn Agre has not yet received the money, and even though money damages are, by definition, an adequate remedy at law, which precludes any award of injunctive relief.

Putting aside [a few federal judges on a sheer lawlessness kick](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/dissent-in-vaccine-mandate-case-questions-whether-law-students-understand-law-better-than-majority/), parties don’t get preliminary injunctions for entirely calculable damages. The plaintiff can just get paid later! Unless the case deals with a party suspected of [playing three card monte with LLCs in an effort to shield assets and weaponize bankruptcy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/after-sandy-hook-verdicts-alex-jones-declares-personal-bankruptcy-also-claims-to-be-owed-55-million-by-his-company/) there’s no reason to bring equitable remedies into this.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
For Kasowitz’s part, the firm lodged some speculative allegations that Glenn Agre may be planning to spend the success fee to cover other obligations. But… so what? The firm can still pay whatever damages on the back end assuming Kasowitz is owed anything, which is still an open question because the client terminated Kasowitz before the conclusion of the matter, making the whole dispute akin to demanding a bonus in December after leaving the firm in February.

Kasowitz claims it billed a lot of time that contributed to that success — the fact that those hours were billed mostly by the current Glenn Agre team notwithstanding — but it’s a success fee not some kind of post hoc bonus on the hourly rate. If the firm didn’t want the risk of missing out on the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, it could have negotiated to get all the money from billables. Without knowing the details of partnership agreements and all, it seems as though Glenn Agre is being super cool to offer Kasowitz a slice of this fee.

This is just the beginning of this story, but whatever the merits, Kasowitz is off to a rocky start. There’s a school of litigator that believes maximum aggression is the only gear available, but starting a lawsuit with a, shall we say, questionable shot at the end zone doesn’t exactly ingratiate you with the judge.

# This Biglaw Firm Won't Be Moving To A 4-Day In-Office Attendance Policy -- Yet
## But attendance will be taken into account for performance reviews. Yikes....

The four-day in-office workweek may be trending among the some of the most successful Biglaw firms in the country — we’re talking firms like [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/you-didnt-see-your-kids-before-the-pandemic-you-shouldnt-expect-to-see-them-now-says-elite-law-firm-partner/), [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/davis-polk-4-day-office/), [Weil Gotshal](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/weil-gotshal-4-days-in-office/),[ Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/ropes-gray-4-day-office-policy/), and [Vinson & Elkins](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/vinson-elkins-4-day-office/) — but not all of them have been convinced to make the move… at least not yet.

Sources tell us that Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft — a firm that brought in $544,832,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it in 84th place in the most recent Am Law 100 — recently sent out a firmwide memo concerning its attendance policies, and it looks like the firm won’t be forcing its employees back to the office for four days each week — at least not “at this time.” Here’s an excerpt from the memo (available on the next page):

Over the last few weeks, we have been assessing our in-office attendance policy and contemplating the benefits of transitioning to a 4-day in office schedule. After careful consideration, we have decided not to increase to 4 days at this time. We will continue with our current 3-day schedule, with Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, being the required days in office.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Partners at the firm were reportedly gung-ho about moving to a four-day in-office week, but with the three-day policy still in place, sources say partners are not-so gently “reminding us to remind our ‘friends’ in other offices to go in or we’ll move to a four-day workweek.”

Unfortunately, those three in-office days at CWT will come at a price. It seems the firm will now be tracking attendance and using it as part of performance evaluations. From the memo:

In order for this 3-day in office schedule to be successful and to maximize the benefits of the in-person work experience, we need your full compliance. Beginning in September, we will be reporting attendance regularly to practice group chairs and administrative department heads. Your compliance with our office attendance policy will be taken into consideration as part of your performance evaluation. We recognize that some flexibility may be needed, as has always been the case. However, absent an occasional exception, employee attendance will be expected on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.

There seems to be some confusion as to how compliance with CWT’s attendance policy will be used in performance reviews. “Will it affect our bonuses or what? How will it be measured?” one source wonders. “How will I know if they correctly logged me in while I’m at the office?”

Associates at the firm are concerned about their bonuses, but we’re equally as concerned that noncompliance with the firm’s attendance policy may lead to layoffs. Let’s hope that it doesn’t come to that.

How is your firm mandating (or not) in-office attendance? As soon as you find out about office attendance plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firm Decided Road Trip, Not Bonuses, Is The Way To Associates' Hearts
## Associates at the firm aren't thrilled.

It’s a cute idea — really, it is. The conceit of the project is that morale needs a boost right now and firm executives are hitting the road to make in-person visits to each U.S. office. Greenberg Traurig executive chairman Richard Rosenbaum and Brian Duffy, the firm’s CEO, have taken to a “beat up” RV and are hitting the road to see all 30 U.S offices of the firm.

It’s adorable, really. Especially as Rosenbaum [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/2021/04/13/big-law-executives-hit-the-road-in-an-rv/) the duo are sleeping in the RV and driving it themselves.

[Rosenbaum] and Duffy, the 2,171-lawyer firm’s CEO, embarked on a cross-country road trip last weekend to meet with each of the firm’s 30 U.S. offices. The tour, dubbed “Mel on Wheels” for the firm’s late founder, Mel Greenberg, is a bid to reconnect attorneys and demonstrate the Miami-based firm’s appreciation for the lawyering that helped it reach $1.7 billion in revenue last year, 5.4% higher than 2019.

“We’re not going to remember last year based on the fact that the financial numbers were on every measure the best they ever were. We’re going to remember that we came together, that we respected our people, that we didn’t do across-the-board layoffs,” he said. “A firm that values those things wants to make sure people understand those values, that we’re not going to jot off a quick email and then go home.”

The trip seems like a PR dream come true, combining the longed for in-person reconnections with all the cutesy of a buddy comedy waiting to happen. Rosenbaum says an RV road trip was on his bucket list, while Duffy had no such dreams, but the germ of the adventure was planted last year:

“After we got through that first quarter, we were thinking about the cultural impact of the pandemic — how could we stay connected,” Duffy said in an interview. “Richard said, ‘let’s get an RV and drive around the country when it’s safe!’ And I’ll be honest I thought he was joking, but it started to take on a life of its own.”

And it’s been branded as an outreach move with a charity twist:

“We took a chunk of our lives,” Rosenbaum continued. “And got into this little beat-up RV and drove ourselves. We slept in campgrounds. And they know why we’re doing it — to see them, but also for them to come together with each other.”

The first leg of the trip, happening this week, includes the firm’s Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Orlando, Tampa, Tallahassee, Atlanta, Houston, Austin and Dallas offices. Future legs will traverse the rest of the country, and Duffy said the firm is donating a minimum of $100,000 to local charities along the way and asking partners to match.

And while I’m sure the intentions were well placed, several tipsters at the firm are less than thrilled. Mostly because the firm, despite the bump in revenue discussed, [hasn’t ponied up the special COVID appreciation bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-bonus-chart-2020/) making their way through Biglaw. Take a look at some of the comments from insiders:

Greenberg Traurig senior management bought an RV and are supposedly going to drive to all the US offices as a “Getting Together” (GT = getting together, what a top shelf joke…). Coming to the office when the RV arrived is supposedly optional (except it’s not really) and attorneys are not exactly thrilled with the initiative, especially after no 2020 or 2021 Covid bonuses.

Just want to give you an update. While Greenberg Traurig’s firm leadership is busy having fun traveling around the country in their souped up RV (called Mel on Wheels) the associates are getting more and more pissed off about the lack of bonuses. Somehow firm leadership fails to see the obscenity in parading around celebrating GTs fantastically successful year (with partners seeing 6% increase in profits!) but yet not willing to provide market compensation. Yesterday, GT New York had a conference call with the associates to check in and discuss returning to office. They said that they are aware that other firms have made announcements regarding bonuses but GT is never one to follow the pack. They said GT is taking a pragmatic and deliberate approach towards giving merit based bonuses but have no other updates at this time. They hope to have more news next week. Needless to say, associates feel burned and unappreciated.

Those are very fair points. It’s hard to watch a firm thrilled with their financial performance — and over a billion dollars in revenue — still not give market compensation to their associates. Until the bonuses that peer firms are giving out are on the table at GT this road trip is likely to ring hollow.

# There's A 27 Percent Global Gender Pay Gap For Equity Partners
## These numbers are discouraging.

There is finally some hard data on the problem of the gender pay gap within the equity partner ranks. According to a [new survey](https://www.acritas.com/Stars2018ExecSummary) by Acritas, in which they asked 828 lawyers independently nominated as stand-outs about the previous year’s compensation, the mean average pay gap between male equity partners and female equity partners is a dismal 27 percent.

According to the data, the mean average pay gap was so stark, in part because there are more “extreme” high earners amongst the men. But even when you look at the median averages, male equity partners are still making more than females — at a rate of 19 percent more.

This data isn’t particularly shocking — though it continues to be disappointing. Acritas has [previously published](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/the-old-boys-network-is-as-strong-as-ever-study-finds-male-clients-prefer-male-attorneys/?rf=1) a study which shows male in-house counsel prefer to hire male attorneys to work for them, which undermines women’s ability to earn the all-important origination credit for new matters, which counts for a hefty amount of an equity partner’s paycheck. As Lisa Hart Shepherd, CEO at Acritas, said:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“The gender bias Acritas observed in that external male counsel are less likely to pick a female lead partner will not be helping, as we know originations and/or new business are taken into account more than 80% of equity partners’ pay.

“By rebalancing and broadening the criteria used to determine compensation to allow for this bias, firms may be able to create fairer reward. In the longer term, law firms need to find a way to break through social networks, both inside of the firm and with clients, to enable female partners to get more equal exposure to clients.”

There are obviously many other factors that contribute to this gap, such as areas of speciality and number of years in partnership. But even when that was controlled for, male equity partners made $125,000 more than female equity partners:

For example, the research shows a higher proportion of female equity partners specialize in labor and that labor equity partners are paid significantly less, regardless of their gender. Pay also increases with years of experience and Acritas’ data shows women equity partners have generally been partners for a shorter number of years. However, even normalizing for these factors, Acritas confirmed a pay gap still exists. A female equity partner working in the same country and practice area, made partner in the same year could expect to earn $125k less than her male counterpart.

Shepherd also expressed disappointment that the higher a woman climbs in the legal profession, it does not get better:

“It is astonishing to see such a large gender pay gap at equity partner level. For women that have achieved equity partner status, they should be facing a more equal playing field but clearly this is not the case.”

While there is still a lot of work to be done in this area, the data the Acritas survey provides is an important first step. Having cold, hard numbers takes the issue out of the more easily dismissed anecdotal world.

# Biglaw Partner Treated Client As 'Cash Cow,' Gets Benchslapped In Court Judgment
## Oh, and words like 'negligent' and 'reckless' get thrown around too.

They say everything’s bigger in Biglaw, and that includes the losses. Last week, Dechert and its former white-collar crime head, Neil Gerrard, lost a case against former client Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (“ENRC”) in London’s High Court. And by lost, it’s more like got demolished.

Gerrard was hired by ENRC to investigate a whistleblower complaint about its Kazakhstan operations (the engagement began in December 2010 when Gerrard was at DLA Piper, but the matter moved to Dechert when Gerrard did in April 2011). But as [reported by ](https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news-focus/news-focus-blockbuster-judgment-in-enrc-v-dechert-gerrard-and-sfo/5112615.article)the Law Gazette, the matter expanded quickly. And as the High Court judge in this case, Mr. Justice David Waksman, found that was to Gerrard’s financial benefit:

The investigation, which was initially estimated to cost £400,000 but racked up fees of around £13m, expanded to include allegations relating to operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and also looked into whether an ENRC subsidiary had sold material to Iran in breach of sanctions. ‘Almost all’ of Gerrard’s income between April 2011 and April 2013 came from the profits arising from the £13m he billed to ENRC, Waksman noted.

Indeed, Waksman found that the pecuniary interest was so strong that Gerrard leaked confidential client information to the Serious Fraud Office and the press in an attempt to expand the investigation because he was “obsessed with making money.”

Gerrard – who was described at last year’s blockbuster trial as ‘Machiavellian’ and accused of treating ENRC as a ‘cash cow’ – was ‘the instigator’ of three leaks to the media, the judge ruled.

He found that the first leak to The Times, resulting in a ‘highly damaging’ article in August 2011, was ‘instigated’ by Gerrard and said it ‘shows that he lied continuously on this particular issue [and] suggests that he was capable of very serious professional wrongdoing’.

‘For a solicitor instructed on behalf of a client to cause a leak of the kind in issue here is extremely serious conduct which it might be thought would be almost unimaginable in the case of a straightforward competent solicitor,’ Waksman said. ‘I regret to say that I do not regard it as unimaginable in the case of Mr Gerrard.’

This matter has previously come to the [pages of Above the Law because of the allegation Gerrard referred to billing in the case as “rape mode.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-most-offensive-way-to-refer-to-biglaw-bills/) During the trial, Gerrard denied the allegation, but the judge has his doubts:

‘As for the shocking expression “I’m in rape mode”, it is so obviously appalling that one has to question whether it is really likely that a solicitor would use it, especially in a restaurant where others might overhear,’ Waksman said.

‘For his part, in cross-examination Mr Gerrard indignantly denied it. However, I regret to say that Mr Gerrard, being the volatile character that he is, was in my view capable of saying it.’

And the judge took a dim view of all the leaking of client information:

He added that Gerrard was also ‘in gross breach of duty to ENRC’ in relation to leaks leading to articles in The Sunday Times in December 2011 – which caused a 5.6% drop in the then-FTSE 100 company’s share price, wiping £400m-500m off its value – and the Financial Times in March 2013.

Waksman found that Gerrard was ‘at least in reckless breach of duty’ in respect of 22 unauthorised contacts with SFO staff – including former director Richard Alderman, who ‘tipped Mr Gerrard off’ about a letter from the SFO to ENRC in August 2011 – during his investigation.

The judge said on Monday that Gerrard, who retired at the end of 2020, was ‘negligent and for the most part reckless’ in unnecessarily expanding his investigation in relation to ENRC’s operations in Kazakhstan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. He was also found to be negligent over his failure to record his advice in writing and in giving wrong advice about ENRC’s potential criminal liability, failing to determine the scope of the SFO’s concerns and failing to protect ENRC’s privilege.

The judge also offered this startlingly honest assessment of Gerrard: “I very much regret to say that in general I found [Gerrard] to be a highly unreliable and at times dishonest witness. His evidence was often inconsistent with the documents or implausible and, on more than one occasion, he was plainly lying.”

Yikes.

Gerrard is reportedly “devastated” by the decision. Saying, “After over 30 untainted years as a solicitor, I remain sure of the appropriateness of my actions, of my advice in relation to my former client and of my personal and professional integrity. I gave evidence to the best of my ability and believed I was telling the truth at all times. I would like to thank Dechert for their support.”

But a Dechert spokesperson offered this statement on the matter:

Trust among partners is integral to any partnership and, throughout this litigation, Dechert has always acted in good faith in reliance on the assurances given to us by our former partner. The court has now found Mr Gerrard to have committed conduct which is completely at odds, not only with our values, ethos, and culture as a firm, but also with the high ethical and professional standards adhered to on a daily basis by our lawyers the world over.

Maybe that “support” is over.

# Most Biglaw Firms Will Soon Match Davis Polk Salary Scale, Says Industry Expert
## The lateral market is on fire, so salary increases should be imminent.

Many firms were waiting to see what the compensation leaders were going to do. Now that one of those firms has made their move, I would anticipate that we will start to hear from other firms that traditionally have matched.

— [Summer Eberhard](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/summer-eberhard?byconsultantorauthor=summer-eberhard), managing director in the associate practice group at recruiter Major Lindsey & Africa, commenting on [how the Biglaw market will likely react](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/davis-polks-salary-scale-surpasses-milbanks-for-top-associates) to the new salary scale that was recently [announced by Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/). The new compensation scheme beats the [Milbank scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) by offering more money to midlevel and senior associates, and Eberhard says it “sends a signal to the more experienced attorneys at the firm the value that they bring.” According to Eberhard, experience also matters in the lateral hiring market right now. “[F]irms seem to be prioritizing experience more than they did last year,” she said.

# WOW!!! Once Again, Davis Polk Raises The Bar On Bonuses
## Holy crap! This is a lot of money.

On Friday, Willkie Farr surprised associates with [special spring bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/). Those bonuses matched the [appreciation bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) that Davis Polk handed out in September 2020 — ranging from $7,500 to $40,000 — but would be paid out in two parts (once on June 30, and once on September 30). Associates were thrilled about the extra cash, and we wondered when the spring bonus craze would catch on across America’s Biglaw firms.

Pay attention, everyone, because that time is now.

Davis Polk really liked being Biglaw’s compensation leader, and the firm has once again entered the scene to fatten associates’ bank accounts with a bigger, better, more inclusive special bonus scale. Here’s what we’re working with (turn to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/2) to see the full memo from the firm):



Holy crap! Not only will Davis Polk associates — and counsel, too — see the first installment of their bonus bucks in April instead of in June, but the firm is handing out thousands of more dollars than Willkie. This is how much more bonus cash DPW is handing out, by class year:

- Class of 2020: $4,500
- Class of 2019: $6,000
- Class of 2018: $12,000
- Class of 2017: $16,500
- Class of 2016: $19,500
- Class of 2015: $22,200
- Class of 2014 and senior, including counsel: $24,000
The great news doesn’t end there, because Davis Polk has already committed to paying year-end bonuses in “at least” the same amounts paid last year. That means associates at the firm — and potentially all other peer firms — are looking at a potential bonus compensation scale ranging from $27,000 to $164,000. That is an eye-popping amount of money.

Which firms will step up to share the wealth with associates for their hard work during the pandemic? Stay tuned to see which Biglaw firms are true peer firms to the compensation titan that is Davis Polk.

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/2) to see the full memo from Davis Polk.)

# Morning Docket: 07.01.16
## * In case you haven't been keeping score like we have, these are the firms that recently raised salaries: [Foley Hoag](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-firm-raises-salaries-for-first-year-associates-only/), [Patterson Belknap](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-biglaw-firm-raises-salaries-just-in-the-nick-of-time/), [Venable](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/could-a-5th-year-make-less-than-a-3rd-year-maybe-according-to-this-firm/) (officially), and [Seward & Kissel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/with-deadline-looming-firms-continue-to-issue-raises/). If you’re worried you’ve missed any of our coverage on pay raises, you can check out our [omnibus 2016 salary chart](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/) where we collect these stories. [[2016 Salary Increase / Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/)] * Thanks to the power of ""a phenomenally strong public interest created by modern media"" and an attorney who ""fell below the standard of a reasonable professional judgment"" in handling the case, Adnan Syed, whose murder conviction was the subject of the acclaimed first season of the ""Serial"" podcast, has been granted a new trial. [[NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/30/484225226/adnan-syed-subject-of-serial-podcast-will-get-a-new-trial)] * First comes raises in the United States for the third-largest law firm by headcount, then comes yet another merger. DLA Piper is combining with Grönberg Advokatbyrå, a 21-lawyer Swedish boutique that practices litigation, corporate, and compliance work. If all goes well, the merger is expected to close in October 2016. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/dla-piper-announces-merger-plans-in-sweden/)] * This list of the world's wealthiest lawyers includes several Biglaw celebrities, a few current and former television judges, a handful of ex cons, and even people who have been disbarred. Some lawyers have higher net worths, but they don't use their law degrees, so they weren't included on the list. [[Money Inc.](http://moneyinc.com/richest-lawyers/view-all) via [ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/who_are_the_worlds_richest_practicing_lawyers_some_on_the_list_went_to_pris)] * What's it like to train for the Olympics and complete law school at the same time? Ask Ashley Higginson, who recently graduated from Rutgers Law. Today, the steeplechaser will be competing to qualify for the Rio Olympics. Best of luck from all of your friends here at Above the Law!

* In case you haven’t been keeping score like we have, these are the firms that recently raised salaries: [Foley Hoag](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-firm-raises-salaries-for-first-year-associates-only/), [Patterson Belknap](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-biglaw-firm-raises-salaries-just-in-the-nick-of-time/), [Venable](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/could-a-5th-year-make-less-than-a-3rd-year-maybe-according-to-this-firm/) (officially), and [Seward & Kissel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/with-deadline-looming-firms-continue-to-issue-raises/). If you’re worried you’ve missed any of our coverage on pay raises, you can check out our [omnibus 2016 salary chart](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/) where we collect these stories. [[2016 Salary Increase / Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/)]

* Thanks to the power of “a phenomenally strong public interest created by modern media” and an attorney who “fell below the standard of a reasonable professional judgment” in handling the case, Adnan Syed, whose murder conviction was the subject of the acclaimed first season of the “Serial” podcast, has been granted a new trial.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

* First comes raises in the United States for the third-largest law firm by headcount, then comes yet another merger. DLA Piper is combining with Grönberg Advokatbyrå, a 21-lawyer Swedish boutique that practices litigation, corporate, and compliance work. If all goes well, the merger is expected to close in October 2016. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/dla-piper-announces-merger-plans-in-sweden/)]

* This list of the world’s wealthiest lawyers includes several Biglaw celebrities, a few current and former television judges, a handful of ex cons, and even people who have been disbarred. Some lawyers have higher net worths, but they don’t use their law degrees, so they weren’t included on the list. [[Money Inc.](http://moneyinc.com/richest-lawyers/view-all) via [ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/who_are_the_worlds_richest_practicing_lawyers_some_on_the_list_went_to_pris)]

* What’s it like to train for the Olympics and complete law school at the same time? Ask Ashley Higginson, who recently graduated from Rutgers Law. Today, the steeplechaser will be competing to qualify for the Rio Olympics. Best of luck from all of your friends here at Above the Law! You can do it!

As I have both [written](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/professional-development-for-law-students/) and [podcasted](https://www.geeklawblog.com/2018/11/e18-nicholas-alexiou-professional-development-needs-law-students.html) about before, Vanderbilt has an extensive professional development series designed to help all of our students — with a particular emphasis on 1Ls — build their non-academic legal skills while also learning more about the profession as a whole.  While the programming is extremely valuable for students, for me, the fifth iteration of how to excel as a summer associate is not something I feel compelled to attend, having both heard all of the advice before and having previously lived that [glorious summer associate life](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/being-a-summer-associate-is-the-best-job-youll-have-in-the-legal-industry/) with subsequent post-graduation employment offers — though it is always great to see wonderful Vanderbilt alumni who come back to campus for these presentations.  Instead, that lunch hour can be spent catching up on the important issues of the day, such as #GetReeseToVanderbilt.

But while certain important topics are covered each and every year, sometimes a new presentation will crop up and catch my attention.  This happened last month with a professional development event entitled “A Brand New Way of Interviewing: What You Need to Know.”  Sponsored by [O’Melveny](https://www.omm.com), the presentation featured [John-Paul Motley](https://www.omm.com/professionals/john-paul-motley/), Managing Partner of the firm’s Los Angeles office (Vanderbilt Law Class of 1999), and [Darin Snyder](https://www.omm.com/professionals/darin-w-snyder/), Regional Head of Litigation for Northern California, and perhaps more importantly for the day, the firm’s Diversity and Inclusion Partner.  While Motley served as the Vanderbilt hook, Snyder was the star of the show, walking the students through OMM’s new method of finding law school talent.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Snyder began by discussing the two biggest flaws in the current system of legal recruiting — there are far more than two, but this was a good place to start.  First, despite the massive financial resources of O’Melveny (gross revenue in 2018 [surpassed $800 million](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/02/28/omelveny-posts-record-income-profit-growth-in-2018/)), due to the finite nature of the recruiting calendar and the metaphysical fact that their attorneys cannot be on multiple campuses at once, the firm is only able to meet with a tiny percentage of the [111,000+ law students enrolled on campuses across the country](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/law-school-enrollment-is-up-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-a-decade/?rf=1).  Given these constraints, like most elite firms, OMM tends to only recruit (at least on campus) at the elite law schools.  Setting aside the issue of how this limited OCI reach can perpetuate and entrench privilege, even at the schools O’Melveny visits, they are only afforded an opportunity to meet with a limited number of students.  For example, Vanderbilt’s Class of 2021 is around 180 students.  A full OCI interview schedule consists of 18 interview slots.  That means, at best, OMM is getting a chance to meet with 10 percent of the class.  And Vanderbilt is a small school.  When looking at the size of the classes at law schools such as Harvard, NYU, or Georgetown, unless a firm is bringing a group of associates that would rival a World War II landing party in size, said firm is probably only reaching a minute portion of the class.  So how can employers fix this issue?  Snyder told the assembled Vanderbilt students that he thinks he has a way for the firm to thoroughly evaluate any law student, at any law school, who might be interested in working for O’Melveny.



Snyder introduced us to [Pymetrics](https://www.pymetrics.com).  Designed by neuroscientists, Pymetrics bills itself as a bias-free way for employers to evaluate candidates through a series of short computer games.  As applicants play these games, a profile of key employment traits is generated.  An algorithm then compares the candidate’s profile to a model for that particular employer and determines whether that individual could excel at the firm.  It sounded simultaneously simple and revolutionary.  Pymetrics is currently being used in Corporate America by entities such as Unilever, LinkedIn, and Mercer, but Snyder believes O’Melveny is the first law firm to employ this recruiting approach.

Not surprisingly, the biggest question on attendees’ minds was also the one that Snyder could not/would not answer, what traits are OMM looking for, i.e., what’s the firm’s model.  However, he was happy to describe how the model came about.  Since initially the Pymetrics approach is only being used for entry-level hiring initially — if successful, Snyder has grand plans of employing it for hiring decisions across the spectrum, including lateral associates and partners — the firm identified a number of junior associates who are currently excelling at the firm and had them play the games.  The traits identified in those associates formed the foundation of the model.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
While one plays Pymetrics games on a computer, these are not standard video games wherein the object is to “win.”  There are no victories in these games, but rather they serve to capture personality traits.  Thus, the results generated by the games should be the same after one play as it would be after 50.  This eliminates any disadvantage for those students who attend law schools which operate on delayed schedule from the rest of their peer institutions.  It also makes it highly unlikely that a Pymetrics coaching/tutoring industry will develop and introduce socioeconomic bias that this process is designed to eliminate.

As I was curious to see what students, including those at Vanderbilt, would have to go through if they wanted a summer associate position with O’Melveny, Snyder was kind enough to provide me access to play the games.  When I first logged on, I was expecting to meet Joshua from Wargames.


Instead, a friendly video popped up and I was told there would be 15 games that could take upwards of 20 minutes to complete.  The most important factor is that I was to make sure I would not be distracted while playing the games.  As a father of two kids under the age of four and three pets, including a mewling cat who is mystified as to why 2:45 a.m. is not the ideal time to play, even if I am able to carve out 20 minutes without actual distractions, there is still the seemingly constant distraction of abject exhaustion.  Plus, living in a country run by Donald Trump is its own unceasing distraction.  But putting those concerns aside, I dove into games with such innocuous titles as “Balloon” and “Easy or Hard.”  Alas, there was no Global Thermonuclear War.

While the whole point of these games is that takers cannot “learn” how to play them, I will skip too much detail on the actual gameplay involved, except to say that it turns out I am very good at hitting the spacebar on my computer in rapid succession.  Once I finished, Pymetrics generated a long “trait report” containing my “unique cognitive and emotional profile.”  Turns out I am trusting, fair-minded, and great at screening out distractions, though not as altruistic as I thought.  As a high school policy debater, I was subjected to far more Ayn Rand than is probably healthy at that, or really any, age, so I will place the blame there.  If I were applying to O’Melveny, the Pymetrics algorithm would inform the firm if I was a good match with their model.

I can imagine that the natural instinct of anyone in the legal employment realm might well be skepticism to a 20-minute computer test determining Biglaw employment.  But the standard OCI screener interview is the exact same length and it is there that the applicant pool is [most whittled down](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-fall-recruiting-season-part-ii-the-initial-interview/).  An employer is probably going to get more valuable information from the Pymetrics trait report than what tree a student said they would be if they had to be a tree, or what their favorite 1L class had been.  Some logistics questions abound.  While the value of Pymetrics is clearly obvious for those schools/students OMM would not otherwise get to interview, it is still not perfectly clear how these tests will integrate with the existing interviewing structure.  Are students who are interviewing with the firm at OCI take these tests before their screener interview?  After?  Before a potential callback?

Snyder told the Vanderbilt assemblage that if Pymetrics proves successful — an evaluation that will take years, if not decades — he can see it surpassing academic performance in the firm’s evaluative process.  Though in subsequent conversation, he made it clear that Pymetrics will be part of the OMM evaluative process and will not represent the entirety of how candidates are evaluated.  If the utilization of Pymetrics results in strong first-year associate classes, the importance of Pymetrics in the evaluative process could well continue to grow, but they do not anticipate going to the extent of some corporations which exclusively use Pymetrics to find new talent.  That makes sense as I am a bit dubious that an Am Law 50 firm would pass on a Sears Prize winner from Harvard merely because a computerized test revealed some personality traits that were not shared by standout attorneys at the firm.  But I applaud the effort to break out of the old interview modes and embrace a technological approach that is ideally free of bias.  Not to mention, it is kind of fun to play.

# Advice For Layoff Victims On Being Transparent During Their New Job Searches
## What happens when you can't say why you're leaving your current firm?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

The firms that are laying them off are trying to help the attorneys but a consequence is that the departing attorneys are sometimes limited in their ability to be candid.

They don’t know if being fully transparent is the smart thing to do or if it’s going to blow up on them.

If you are going to sign a severance agreement, make sure you understand what you can and can’t say, and that you’re not contractually prevented from being honest about your own particular circumstances when a new firm asks, ‘So why are you leaving?’

— [Dan Binstock](https://g-s.com/dc-legal-recruiters/dan-binstock.php#:~:text=Summary%3A%20Dan%20Binstock%20is%20a,highly%20efficient%20and%20discreet%20manner.), a partner with D.C.-based search firm Garrison, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/06/big-law-layoffs-are-resulting-in-problematic-severance-agreements-for-job-hunting-lawyers/) on what associates who have [recently been laid off](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) should expect when it comes to their job searches, i.e., the need to maintain confidentiality as to the terms of their departure from their old firms versus the need to be candid with their future firms about what inspired their decision to enter the lateral market.

# Biglaw Partner From Key Swing State Gets Trump Admin Position

James D. Schultz

Another Biglaw partner has nabbed a position in the Trump administration. No, it isn’t someone else from Jones Day (the firm has [pulled down](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/jones-day-in-the-white-house-the-biglaw-firm-fills-top-jobs-in-the-trump-administration/) a healthy number of positions in the new administration), but it is an early supporter of Donald Trump from the key swing state of Pennsylvania.

James D. Schultz, chair of Cozen O’Connor’s Government Law and Regulatory Affairs practice group, has been tapped as Associate White House Counsel and Special Assistant to the President. This isn’t an unexpected turn for Schultz, as he’s previously served as General Counsel of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As Cozen’s[ press release notes](https://www.cozen.com/news-resources/news/2017/cozen-o-connor-attorney-james-d-schultz-to-serve-in-the-trump-administration-as-associate-white-house-counsel-and-special-assistant-to-the-president):

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
An early supporter of President Trump, Schultz, a veteran of Pennsylvania politics, assisted on President Trump’s successful primary campaign effort in the Keystone State. Later, Schultz played a key role at the Republican National Convention, offering critical advice and assistance on floor operations as well as to the platform and rules committees. After the November election, Schultz was appointed as legal counsel to the president-elect’s transition team.

Schultz has deep roots in the Keystone state (remember the state was key to Trump’s electoral victory), as he received his J.D. from Widener University School of Law, and his B.A. from Temple University. The firm seems proud to have landed a place in the Trump team:

“It’s no surprise that the President has called Jim back to public service,” said Michael J. Heller, President and CEO of Cozen O’Connor. “Serving in the office of White House Counsel is an extremely prestigious honor. We are very proud of Jim and his appointment to serve in that office. Jim has had a distinguished record of achievement in both the public and private sectors. As General Counsel to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Jim served the citizens of Pennsylvania well and I know he will be a tremendous asset to the President’s legal team and our country.”

Wonder if prospective summer associates will be as thrilled.

As each hour ticks by, another law firm’s partnership makes the hard decision on what to do in light of the havoc that the coronavirus outbreak has wreaked upon society at large. Will the firm cut salaries? Are furloughs or layoffs in play? What about reducing partner draws and distributions for the good of the team?

One Biglaw firm is doing everything it can to save jobs, but that means people will have to suffer when their salaries are slashed.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Sources tell us that Am Law 200 firm Day Pitney plans to enact numerous cost-cutting measures in an effort to help stabilize the firm through the economic upheaval that’s been caused by COVID-19’s impact on America. Specifically, we hear that the firm will introduce pay cuts firmwide, shortened work schedules for staff, and reduced partner draws and distributions.

We reached out to Day Pitney for confirmation, and received a statement from [Tom Goldberg](https://www.daypitney.com/professionals/g/goldberg-thomas-d), the firm’s managing partner:

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, like most businesses, Day Pitney has been faced with some very difficult decisions. To maintain our financial stability during this time while continuing to effectively serve our clients, we have implemented several measures beginning April 13, including:

1. A 15% pay cut for all attorneys and some staff

2. During the remote working period, a temporary reduction to 60% of normal working hours and pay for other staff

3. Significant reductions to partner draws and suspension of the scheduled April supplemental distribution

While the cost reductions are spread among all groups within the firm, we recognize that the partners must bear the greatest share of the burden. We intend that the partners’ share of any shortfall this year will exceed that of the firm’s employees.

We have not taken these steps lightly and recognize that these reductions may impose material hardships.

“We are implementing these measures to preserve the financial health of the firm, to assure that we remain well-positioned to serve our clients, and to mitigate the need for any type of layoffs or furloughs,” Goldberg said. “We remain confident in the long-term success of our firm.”

It’s a new year, and Biglaw bonuses are continuing to roll in. Today, we have news from a firm that’s been embroiled in Trumpworld drama, and with a new administration taking over tomorrow, the powers that be decided to offer their associates some welcome bonuses.

The firm in question is Kasowitz Benson, and associates are quite pleased, saying this is “great news.” Here’s the firm’s bonus scale, which is a match of the prevailing rates set by Baker McKenzie and Cravath in November 2020.

Class of 2020 – $15,000 (prorated)
Class of 2019 – $15,000
Class of 2018 – $25,000
Class of 2017 – $50,000
Class of 2016 – $65,000
Class of 2015 – $80,000
Class of 2014 – $90,000
Class of 2013 – $100,000
Class of 2012 – $100,000

Kasowitz is also offering special bonuses, ranging from $7,500 – $40,000, depending on seniority and performance. Unlike many other firms, Kasowitz has completely thrown out its 2020 billable hours requirements due to the pandemic. Here’s a relevant excerpt from the firm’s bonus memo:

In recognition of the extraordinary work circumstances this year, we will not be using a fixed hours target for 2020, but will evaluate each attorney’s performance on an individual basis, and the amount of bonus, if any, will be determined at the discretion of the firm. We will continue to include all billable, pro bono, new business development (063), new matters in process (111), recruiting, Kasowitz University, and Associates Committee hours recorded between December 1, 2019 and November 30, 2020 in that evaluation.

Congratulations to everyone at Kasowitz. Associates can expect to see their bonus bucks from the firm land in their accounts on February 15.

# The Lessons Of Loss
## Holding on to those we lose in the workplace.

Tony Hsieh’s death came as a shock last week. Hsieh, only 46, was best known for his 21-year term as CEO of Zappos. He’d retired quietly from that position in August and turned his attention full-time toward rebuilding and revitalizing the downtown of his adopted home, Las Vegas. Hsieh had started working back in 2013 to invest in the community and rebuild it into something vital and thriving. He’d pledged $350 million of his own money toward the goal. Hsieh had grand new adventures and achievements seemingly ahead of him. Now, we can only wonder what more he might have done.

I’ve written [previously in this column](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2017/12/15/the-culture-card-in-law-firms/), and with great admiration, about the unique “holacracy” Hsieh instituted during his time at Zappos. After it ran for years as a more-or-less conventional startup business, Hsieh radically experimented by doing away with org charts, job titles, and management relationships within the company to make it more directly align with the core values he set out to build Zappos around. Many left over the experiment, but with those who stayed behind Hsieh carefully crafted a newer, better, more intentional culture of risk, camaraderie, and open communication. Rather than crater the company, Zappos’ holacracy saw it continue to grow and thrive to the point where Amazon acquired it in 2009.

A Culture King

Hsieh’s obsession with culture was arguably his defining trait as a leader. Hsieh cared so passionately about cultivating a culture to align with his company’s core values that Zappos began hosting “Culture Camps” for other interested business leaders to learn how to incorporate Zappos’ dynamic experiences into their own day-to-days.

Hsieh understood that employees can make money almost anywhere, but they’re at their most happy, fulfilled, and productive when they feel like a part of something greater — a place where everyone is capable of effecting change in the workplace. When someone dedicates themselves completely to building a home where people from all walks of life can come together, bonded like family in pursuit of a common cause, their sudden absence leaves behind a gaping chasm in the communities they built. Las Vegas is in mourning this week as it begins to process the loss of one of its favorite sons.

Though I didn’t know him, I’ve long admired Hsieh. Back in 2017, two of my close work colleagues, Marc Lamber and Andy Clawson, and I visited Zappos’ headquarters in Las Vegas to learn more about how Hsieh had grown and developed his company’s culture. Marc, Andy, and I had been working side-by-side every day for years, building out [our practice](https://lambergoodnow.com/) with a small core team. We’d built a sense of trust and camaraderie that we wanted to cultivate in our practice group and throughout the firm. That trip, and brainstorming ways to bring those lessons home, are some of my most cherished memories.

On March 18, 2019, Andy died.

A Hole In The World

Andy’s death was sudden and unexpected, at just 37, leaving behind his beloved wife, Amber. One day, the beating heart of our team was punching ideas into his laptop, cracking jokes, keeping the practice’s plates spinning, exuding kindness and warmth, and making my life better just for being in it. And then he wasn’t.

On the worst days, it feels like there’s a hole in the world somewhere just out of sight. I still find myself thinking what Andy would say about a situation, or how the world would be a bit brighter if he were still around. On the better days, it feels like his spirit is still with us. Andy was a glue person, one of those personalities that brings people together and makes them want to be more compassionate, harder working, and overall better people. I know I’m better for having spent time with him. I know our firm is a better place to this day for the kindness he shared here. But, as I learned through his passing, countless others in Andy’s orbit I’d never met were better because of his kindness, warmth, and friendship.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
December is traditionally the beginning of a season of reunion and renewal. This year, for far too many of us, it will be a season of reflection on those we have lost. As COVID-19 numbers spike, we continue to see sickness and loss tearing through firms, our neighborhoods, the country, and the world. A vaccine may be on the horizon, but that’s not helping today. No business, team or person is off limits. We’re connected by our common vulnerability.

I write often in this column about building team culture as a means to an end. It makes workers happier and law firms more successful. And although that’s true, it’s only part of the equation. The rest of it lies outside of our immediate teams and firm. In addition to being legal professionals, we’re members of bigger communities. We need to care about our friends, coworkers, neighbors, first responders, fellow PTA members, corner grocery store clerks — and even lawyers on the other side of those knock-down, drag-out deals. We need to cultivate strong work and community cultures.

Because in the end, that’s all we leave behind: what we did for each other.

# Yet Another Biglaw Firm Ranking For Those That Like To Count

So which Biglaw firm is the biggest of them all? Not like the firm that has the biggest cases or the most M&A deals but just big in the employs-the-largest-amount-of-lawyers kind of way. Well, good news for all you headcount acolytes out there — the[ 2019 National Law Journal 500](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/06/25/the-nlj-500-main-chart/) is officially here.

As you may recall, the NLJ 500 ranks firms by overall headcount — temporary and contract attorneys don’t count and any non-lawyer professionals do not either. The list is also focused on U.S.-centric firms, meaning they have more attorneys in the U.S. than any other country.

Before we start our counting expedition, let’s get some help from an old friend.

- DLA Piper: 3,702
- Norton Rose Fulbright: 3,376
- Hogan Lovells: 2,636

As we reach the middle of the year, the coronavirus pandemic and volatile financial conditions have substantially affected Chicago’s legal market, limiting both the volume and scope of hiring and triggering firm cost-control measures, such as compensation reductions and layoffs. Despite setbacks, the Chicago attorney hiring market has persisted — and now shows signs of increased activity in certain areas, as firms refocus and adapt to remain competitive in a COVID-19 economy.

We will discuss Chicago law firm associate and partner workforce and hiring trends and statistics in light of recent shelter-in-place orders, as well as how firms are proceeding with the search and interview process during the pandemic.

The Chicago Associate Market: Workforce and Hiring Trends Overview

With respect to the associate job market, some Chicago firms have unfortunately conducted salary cuts, layoffs, furloughs, and complete hiring freezes to lower expenses during the recession. Fortunately, thus far, recent associate layoffs have been on a much smaller scale compared to the 2008 Great Recession, both in terms of the number of firms conducting layoffs and the number of associates let go.

Of 95 Am Law 200 and Chambers-ranked midsize firms we have tracked in Chicago, only 10 firms have conducted layoffs, and they have done so in limited numbers (e.g., targeting specific practice groups compared to massive 2008 workforce reductions).[[1]](#_ftn1) Also, of the 14 Am Law 200 firms headquartered in Chicago, only 4 firms have conducted associate layoffs. In this recession, more firms have opted to institute non-layoff expenditure controls. Approximately 44 percent (37 out of 85) of Am Law 200 firms with offices in Chicago have reduced or delayed compensation for all attorneys. Firms have most commonly reduced associate salaries by 15–20 percent. Some Chicago firms have also furloughed associates for several months.

Practice areas in Chicago that have slowed the most during the pandemic and resulted in more associate layoffs and furloughs are M&A, middle-market debt-finance, transportation finance, and real estate. Some Chicago law firms have avoided layoffs by moving under-utilized associates in slower departments to busier practice groups. This is most common with interrelated practice areas; for example, some Chicago restructuring groups have absorbed M&A and finance associates. M&A and finance associates have transactional and document drafting experience transferable to restructuring practices as well as exposure to restructuring-related deals, such as distressed asset acquisition, recapitalizations, and debtor-in-possession financing. Similarly, firms have moved commercial litigation associates to bankruptcy litigation practice groups.

For those Chicago firms that have conducted layoffs, in order to ease the transition, a few firms have provided associates with three to four months of lead time to find new opportunities, permitting the attorneys to remain as salaried employees. In addition to the financial benefit, these types of arrangements can also help in the lateral application process by avoiding resume gaps and allowing the associate to maintain their practitioner skills. Most associate severance packages provide three months of full or partial salary with healthcare benefits, and some firms provide up to six months of partial salary and healthcare benefits. For associates who have been affected by a COVID-19 related layoff, be sure to consider enrolling in our [Bridge Program](https://brojure.com/laterallinksako/lateral-link-s-covid-19-bridge-program/).

Some Chicago law firms have continued lateral associate hiring, primarily in predictably recession-friendly or COVID-19 driven practice areas such as restructuring, healthcare, labor and employment, data-privacy, and cybersecurity. We have also recently seen a minor uptick in associate interview activity with select finance and real estate practice groups.

In Chicago, we currently have associate candidates interviewing in the following practice areas: restructuring, bankruptcy, debt finance, real estate, labor and employment, healthcare, commercial litigation, healthcare (regulatory and FDA-focused), data privacy, and cybersecurity. Firms are interviewing both local associate candidates and candidates relocating from other markets. Motivations for attorneys lateraling during the pandemic have been both market-driven (e.g., associates laid off or from firms that have reduced salaries) as well as traditional reasons for lateraling, such as upgrading to a higher-ranked firm, or a firm with a larger presence in a desired practice area. Associates relocating to Chicago are often originally from the Midwest or attended a Midwest law school or college with a large Chicago-alumni network.

With respect to associate interview and hiring formats, firms are both interviewing and onboarding new associate hires remotely via Zoom. Firms have made a concerted effort to go above and beyond to welcome and integrate lateral associates to the firm, with significant involvement from firm, practice group, and diversity leadership.

The Chicago Partner Market: Developments and Hiring Trends

Consistent with national trends, learning from 2008, Chicago law firms have since increased capital reserves or have more recently reduced or deferred partner distributions to shore-up cash positions and avoid overreliance on credit lines. Of the 44 percent of Am Law 200 firms in Chicago that have recently lowered or deferred partner compensation, most have reduced equity partner distributions or draws in the range of 10–20 percent.

Chicago firms are still working to tactically invest in revenue growth through lateral partner hiring during the pandemic. Many Chicago law firms are proceeding with lateral partner searches targeting both countercyclical and mainstay practice areas. With that said, given the current economic climate, Chicago firms are more risk averse and are only selectively considering practice groups and partners with proven profitability track-records.

There have also been some notable headline lateral partner and group hires in Chicago over the past few months. Willkie, which opened its new Chicago office in March, has grown to 22 attorneys, adding partners in commercial litigation, IP litigation, and trust and estates. In restructuring, Kirkland & Ellis, the recently merged Faegre Drinker, and Sheppard Mullin have recently hired leading partners in Chicago. Winston & Strawn also recently hired a renowned Chicago class action litigation partner.

Chicago Partner and Associate Hiring by the Numbers 

To assess the impact of COVID-19 on the Chicago lateral market, we can look at recent Chicago associate and partner hiring numbers compared to this time period last year (looking only at Am Law 200 firms).

From March 15, 2020 (around the time Chicago office closures and shelter in place orders began) through July 8, 2020, there were 156 lateral attorneys hired into Chicago firms. Of those 156 hires, 97 were associates, 38 were partners, and 21 were counsels.[[2]](#_ftn2)

Looking at this same period in 2019, during a robust legal economy, there were 220 lateral attorneys hired into Chicago firms. Of those 220 hires, 140 were associates, 54 were partners, and 26 were counsels.

Thus, since Chicago’s COVID-19-related business and law firm office closures, overall lateral attorney movement to new firms dropped by 29 percent, with associate hiring down 31 percent and partner hiring down 30 percent. Looking specifically at the three busiest attorney hiring practice areas during the same period in 2019, corporate hiring dropped most precipitously for both lateral associates and partners, down 54 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In litigation, associate hiring was down 40 percent in 2020 and partner hiring remained the same, with 10 hires during this period in both 2019 and 2020. IP associate and partner hiring essentially stayed at the same level during this period in 2019 and 2020.

Chicago lateral hiring activity has fared slightly better than Am Law 200 firms nationally during the pandemic. Chicago’s overall lateral attorney hiring decrease of 29 percent was 6% less than the national Am Law 200 lateral attorney hiring decline of 35 percent from March 15, 2020 through July 8, 2020. Chicago associate hiring decreased 6 percent less than the national rate of 37 percent, and Chicago partner hiring declined 6 percent less than the national rate of 36 percent.

Although actual associate and partner hiring declined relatively evenly in Chicago over the past few months, many of the hires were in motion pre-COVID-19, and the decrease in legal work volume tends to lag slightly behind declining client demand by a month or more. Therefore, we also need to look at the number and rate of new Chicago associate position openings to ascertain the lateral demand and hiring activity drop. New associate positions in Chicago (from our internal database, including published and non-published searches) were as follows:

- 72 new jobs from June 15, 2019 to September 15, 2019
- 104 new jobs from September 15, 2019 to December 15, 2019
- 103 new jobs from December 15, 2019 to March 15, 2020
- 33 new jobs from March 15, 2020 to June 15, 2020
- 11 new jobs from June 15, 2020 to July 8, 2020
The relatively sharp drop in new associate openings is evident. Looking at current open associate positions in Chicago compared to last year, there are currently 29 active open associate positions (published and non-published), compared to 87 open posted associate positions on July 8, 2019.[[3]](#_ftn3) While the associate market has slowed significantly, as previously discussed, firms are moving forward with targeted searches in certain practice areas.

With respect to partner searches, we are working on a range of Chicago partners searches with top firms. These partner searches are rarely published, given the targeted and relationship-driven nature of the process.

Conclusion

Although the Chicago lateral market has slowed down during the pandemic, we anticipate that specific practice areas (e.g., restructuring, labor and employment, IP, litigation, and data privacy) will remain busy, particularly on the partner side. For Chicago’s transactional practice areas, with private equity firms and asset managers holding significant capital and with fewer structural banking issues than in 2008, we foresee deal activity returning along with attorney hiring as the pandemic subsides.

# Biglaw's Reactions To Same-Bank Bonuses
## Everybody would like one more round before the lights go out.

Biglaw bonuses are out today, [with Milbank leading the way](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/).

The bonuses are the same as last year. Based on my inbox, associates are not exactly thrilled about the extra $15,000 to $100,000 this scale provides. Of particular issue is the fact that in 2018, associates got summer bonuses. In 2019, they did not. So, in overall bonus compensation, a same-scale bonus actually results in less compensation for associates.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I kind of get why firms would be cautious. This could well be the last, or at best penultimate, bonus season before another “market correction.” It makes sense for firms to hold back in preparation for the coming recession.

On the other hand, I think the angered associates have the right of the argument. Why should the firms be hoarding profits in preparation for the recession, instead of sharing more of those profits with the employees, some of whom will be laid off next recession anyway? I doubt very much that in 2021, Milbank will say, “Well Bob, we don’t have to fire you because we cheaped out on bonuses in 2019.”

One associate worked the numbers and determined that Milbank should be paying more to associates if for no other reason than the fact that Milbank is billing clients more for associate labor.

Thanks for your coverage of our early bonuses here at “Thrillbank”. But I thought your article was too generous to Milbank. I know you called out the decrease in total comp, but the article was way too positive. I get it–it’s exciting that they announced early. But they’re trying to cheap out on us by tens of thousands of dollars for the same amount of work.

They increased rates by 4% this year, so comp should go up, not down.

The next firms down the line should know they are going to get ravaged by the legal rags if they just match when the partners get millions while the workhorses don’t even get a cost of living increase

I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’m all about the populist revolution taking it to the fat cats and demanding a more even distribution of wealth. But… you know… a four percent rate increase is not necessarily the hill I would die on. Especially since Biglaw associates are not the people most associated with the righteousness of the proletariat.

The key issue is that if bonuses are a “reward” for “good times,” then Milbank should be giving more because we are still in the good times.

Milbank bonuses static – nobody seems surprised although word on the street is firm had a very good year.

I support the thought here among the mildly disgruntled associates.

However, I’m reminded of an [F. Scott Fitzgerald quote](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/547964-something-bright-and-alien-flashed-across-the-sky-and-for):

Maybe there was a way out by flying, maybe our restless blood could find frontiers in the illimitable air. But by that time we were all pretty well committed; and the Jazz Age continued; we would all have one more.

When the lights flash for last call, some people say, “Man, it’s getting late,” and get ready to go home. Other people rush to the bar and buy two more drinks. Which one of those people you are will probably say a lot about how you view this bonus season.

Attention Biglaw associates: You’ll be pleased to know that if your firm originally shied away from handing out special bonuses earlier this fall, you’ll soon find some extra cash in your accounts on top of your year-end bonuses, and you’ve got Cravath to thank.

Earlier this fall, when elite firms were falling over themselves to match the [Davis Polk special bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/), others were in no rush, instead simply committing to make sure that associates would be properly compensated in the future. That’s [what Goodwin Procter did](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/goodwin-refuses-to-pay-special-fall-bonuses-promises-competitive-cash-come-january-2021/) back in early October. Lo and behold, today, the morning after [Cravath announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/) that it would fall in line to match those generous pandemic bonuses, Goodwin has announced that it will be handing out special bonuses on the DPW scale.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

But, there’s a catch. While the DPW special bonuses merely required associates to be in “good standing,” Goodwin’s special bonuses are hours-based by class year.

Here’s the firm’s scale for these special bonuses:



To get to the 1850 hours threshold, Goodwin will take the higher of (a) associates’ fiscal year 2020 hours (including billable hours, pro bono hours, legal services on behalf of the firm, and shadow training) or (b) associates’  annualized hours for the period May through October 2020. By doing it this way, the firm will be able to recognize more associates, even if their hours tanked because of the coronavirus crisis.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Sources tell us that special bonuses are also being paid to all other non-partner lawyers at the firm, including counsel, senior attorneys, department and discovery attorneys, science advisors, and science law clerks, which is a change from what other firms have been doing for their attorneys (i.e., not much at all).

Goodwin will pay out its regular year-end bonuses in January, which the firm already promised would be “competitive.” Since Cravath has already announced its bonus scale — a [Baker McKenzie match](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) — associates can likely expect to receive their own match in just a few months. Congrats to everyone at Goodwin!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Goodwin.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Top Revenue Firm Hops On Associate Raise Train
## Good news isn't any less good just because it's expected.

After Milbank announced a new associate salary scale, a lot of firms just… kind of sat on their hands. Weeks passed with only a trickle of matches as everyone waited to see if Milbank had really offered the last word on compensation. Davis Polk finally broke that logjam and now Kirkland’s decided to follow suit.

During the salary interregnum, Kirkland sent an all-hands email [announcing a new return-to-office strategy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/kirkland-sends-announcement-to-salary-hungry-associates-about-office-return-date/), frustrating lawyers who understandably didn’t want to hear about heading back to their desks while the rest of the market discussed raises. That unforced error can no be swept under the bridge as the firm finally tells attorneys what they wanted to hear all along:



[UPDATE: Totally stupid me. I had written that it wasn’t clear when these numbers take effect. But the text of the memo mentions nothing about being retroactive because it’s RIGHT THERE IN THE CHART.]

No one ever thought Kirkland would stiff lawyers. The firm has too much money and too much at stake in the battle for talent to sit out a raise. But no one can really rest easy until firms make it official. Kirkland associates can sleep well tonight.

Or, not sleep. Maybe… “Kirkland associates can continue frantically editing from their desks well tonight.”

One by one, Biglaw firms have been adopting the new Davis Polk salary scale. There may not be a formal memo announcing the latest lockstep salary match, but we’ve heard that associates at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan will soon be raking in the money.

Sources from Stroock tell us that the firm officially announced its DPW match earlier this week. As of July 1, salaries at the firm will look something like this:

- 2021: $202,500
- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013: $365,000

# California Biglaw Powerhouse Announces $190K Salary Scale For Associates
## Yet another firm matches Milbank's mad money.

Earlier this week, California-based litigation boutique Hueston Hennigan became the [first firm to officially adopt](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-first-firm-has-matched-the-new-milbank-scale/) Milbank’s new $190K salary structure. We knew it was only a matter of time before an elite West Coast Biglaw firm would match Milbank’s mad money, and it looks like today’s that day, because Irell & Manella has decided to join the party.

Hot off of the prestigious firm’s [market-busting December bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/elite-california-firm-offers-market-busting-bonuses-to-associates/?rf=1), Irell — a firm that’s widely known to beat the market when it comes to associate compensation — has now matched the Milbank salary scale, which looks like this:

- Classes 18/17 $190,000 (+10,000)
- Class 2016 $200,000 (+10,000)
- Class 2015 $220,000 (+10,000)
- Class 2014 $250,000 (+15,000)
- Class 2013 $275,000 (+15,000)
- Class 2012 $295,000 (+15,000)
- Class 2011 $315,000 (+15,000)
- Class 2010 $330,000 (+15,000)

Unfortunately, Irell has not joined Simpson Thacher in announcing [special summer bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/), but we’re still holding out hope that other firms will do their associates a solid and offer up some additional bonus cash on top of their raises. Nonetheless, congratulations to everyone at Irell & Manella on the new pay scale!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important salary updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for all of your help!

# Biglaw Firm Set To Make Layoffs In Departments Hardest Hit By Pandemic Changes
## Staff layoffs for this Magic Circle firm.

There’s no denying that COVID-19 has greatly impacted the ways that most of the world works. Though [Biglaw has largely thrived](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/despite-all-expectations-biglaw-had-a-very-profitable-2020/) throughout the pandemic, there’s still been[ a wave of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) throughout the industry, as firms try to tweak their model to respond to industry changes. Now comes word that yet another Biglaw firm is readying their own round of layoffs.

Magic Circle firm Clifford Chance is reportedly looking at between 44 and 73 layoffs of staff members in its London office. [According to](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/clifford-chance-set-axe-dozens-support-staff-london) Roll on Friday, the departments impacted will be those hardest hit by the move to work from home, spurred by COVID-19. As such, secretaries, those in document production, and mail room staff will be offered severance packages in a “hybrid voluntary/compulsory redundancy approach.” The firm is hopeful this will reduce “the number of compulsory redundancies needed.”

During the height of the pandemic, Clifford Chance avoided furloughs or layoffs, but now the firm says the time has come:

But now, said Regional Managing Partner Michael Bates, “Following a thorough review of our UK operations looking at the impact of Covid and accelerating technological change, we have identified some areas where we need to make changes”.

“Sadly, these proposals will also result in the departure of some of our valued colleagues. This is never an easy decision, and not one that we have taken lightly”.

“We have entered into a consultation with the affected teams, and will also be offering them a voluntary redundancy scheme. Throughout, we will seek to reach our final decisions in a fair and inclusive way that respects our people and reflects our culture. And we will do all that we can to support all of our colleagues as we move through the process”.

Best of luck to those who find themselves out of work.

# Obama Makes Historic Nomination To Federal Judiciary, Makes Donald Trump's Head Explode
## The Donald can't be excited about this Biglaw partner's nomination.

I commend President Obama for taking this important step in continuing to pick the best and brightest from every community to serve as part of our nation’s judiciary. A judiciary that reflects the rich diversity of our nation helps ensure the fair and just administration of the law, and it is vital for American Muslims to be included. Mr. Qureshi’s profound commitment to the rule of law and justice for people of all backgrounds makes him an exceptional nominee.

— Farhana Khera, executive director of the legal advocacy organization Muslim Advocates, [reflecting](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-muslim-federal-judge_us_57cf2cfbe4b03d2d45970d3a) on Barack Obama’s nomination of a Latham & Watkins partner, [Abid Qureshi](https://www.lw.com/people/abid-qureshi), to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Qureshi’s nomination is the first for a Muslim American. Despite the time left in Obama’s presidency, the Senate no longer seems to have the political will to move on any judicial nominations. Given the Republican standard bearer’s [inflammatory rhetoric](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-muslim-judge_us_57542cb6e4b0ed593f14ad78) surrounding a hypothetical where a case involving Donald Trump or any one of his business ventures was before a Muslim judge, it isn’t much of a stretch to assume Qureshi’s nomination would be off the table should Trump win the presidency.

# Associates Facing 25 Percent Pay Cut At Am Law 200 Firm
## Some of the largest pay cuts we've seen.

In times of upheaval, the Above the Law tipster network really shows its strength. Biglaw firms may not want to publicize the cost-cutting measures the coronavirus has forced them into, but it is vital industry information. Transparency is key, always, but particularly in hard times. And when the [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/) and [furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-furloughs-associates-firm-hopeful-they-can-return-to-work-soon/) and [salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/another-am-law-100-firm-turns-to-furloughs-and-salary-cuts-amid-covid-19-crisis/) started happening, our [tips line](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) started blowing up. For that, we thank you.

So, here’s the latest scoop from tipsters: the Am Law 200 firm Curtis (f/k/a Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle) has slashed associate salaries by 25 percent. Those are some of the largest cuts we’ve seen to date.

We reached out to the firm and a spokesperson was able to confirm that, like a growing amount of their peer firms, they’ve instituted these cost-cutting measures.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Yes, Curtis is taking some steps similar to those reported by other firms in response to COVID-19.

Hopefully, this means the firm can avoid layoffs.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

I wouldn’t use ‘evil’ to describe a big organization like Jones Day. I picked them because I regard them as emblematic of the transformation of the legal industry. It’s representative of how the profession has lost its way.

Their calling card is, ‘We’ll stick with you even if you’re a polarizing, toxic client.’ They wear it as a badge of honor. It could be used at a marketing event.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
— David Enrich, author of the new book, [“Servants of the Damned”](https://amzn.to/3TfFYAQ) (affiliate link), which serves as an expose on Jones Day and its controversial clientele, including former President Donald Trump, in conversation with Vivia Chen of [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/is-jones-day-the-most-evil-law-firm-on-the-planet). Retired Jones Day partner Joe Sims referred to Enrich’s book as a “tabloid version of a story that would fit well with other bits of yellow journalism.”

[](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/06/atl-contest-which-is-the-best-event-for-2010-summer-associates/summer-associates/)Times are tough, but firms are still treating their summer associates to some fun, even if it’s cheaper fun than in years past. Last week, we brought you the [finalists](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/07/atl-summer-associate-event-contest-the-finalists/) in our 2010 Summer Associates Event Contest. Some of them are not scrimping:

- Quinn Emanuel: Firm-sponsored hiking trip up Mount St. Helens. (Bonus: If you [make it back down the mountain](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/07/quinn-emanuel-babes-in-the-woodshow-two-summer-associates-got-lost-on-a-firm-hiking-trip/), you get an offer.)
- Paul Hastings: Dinner at a partner’s house in a posh neighborhood, with different street food trucks parked in the driveway, dispensing delicacies and blasting music. (Negative: Summer associates aren’t deemed respectable enough to be served dinner inside the house.)
- Schulte Roth & Zabel: DJ School, where they teach you to mix and be a DJ. (Bonus: If you don’t get an offer, you can work house parties.)
- Irell & Manella: Firm-sponsored weekend trip to Catalina Island off the southern California coast, including hotel rooms, food, drink, kayaking, biking, glass-bottom boat tours, zip-lining, mini golf, arcade tokens. (Bonus: Some summers scored an invite to a partner’s yacht that he keeps docked near Catalina. Potential Negative: Seeing colleagues in bathing suits.)
- Davis Polk & Wardwell: Trapeze School and rock climbing. (Hidden agenda: The firm can make sure their prospective associates’ bodies are well-toned and live up to DPW’s [hottie standards](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/07/davis-polks-website-makeover-now-with-100-percent-way-more-hotties/).)
One [commenter](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/07/atl-summer-associate-event-contest-the-finalists/#comment-61202152) suggested that SRZ had another musical event: a luxury suite at a Lady Gaga concert.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
We moved our summer event to Catalina Island last year and it has been well received. Our summer associate classes have always been top notch and the group this year is no exception. We give them demanding and meaningful legal projects, and they also work on a mock trial before a retired federal judge as well as various pro bono activities, so this retreat is our way of showing how much we appreciate their efforts. As for the “yacht,” all the summer associates were invited — we didn’t want a few of them getting all Andy Samberg and T-Pain on us.

Sounds like being [on a boat](http://www.hulu.com/watch/56632/saturday-night-live-digital-short-im-on-a-boat) at Irell is a good place to be.

# Law Firm Growth Continues... Slowly
## Profits are up, and things are looking good.

At the year’s halfway mark, Citi Private Bank’s Law Firm Group released its report on the state of the industry and revealed what most of us suspected: tepid, but steady growth. Just the way risk-averse lawyers like it!

The key takeaway from the report is that revenue growth in the first half of the year is attributable primarily to rate increases, a fact that no doubt frustrates [the crybaby clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/some-clients-are-super-pissed-about-associate-raises/) who whined that an extra $10/hour would break the bank of their multi-billion dollar companies. But it should concern lawyers that demand growth remained negligible and productivity declined as hiring outpaced demand. Without demand growth, this party will eventually hit a wall.

But the good news is that Biglaw’s profit margin is up, as revenue growth grew faster than expenses, associate raises be damned. In fact, the report found that overhead contributed more to expense growth than compensation. Now, query if some of those laggard firms not raising salaries until September or later will ultimately shift this balance. We’ll have to stay tuned.

All in all, this report finds that 2Q wasn’t [as magical as 1Q](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/law-firms-have-best-quarter-in-8-years/), but firms still have a lot to feel good about going into the latter half of the year.

# Biglaw Firm Doesn't Think Men Get Nearly Enough Credit

When talking about the role of women at your firm, maybe we don’t put a spotlight on the men. Paul Hastings seems to think men at the firm need a pat on the back for “including [women] in client work” and other basic stuff they should be doing anyway. Pro tip: If you’re trying to promote diversity, giving (mostly) white men center stage is doing the very, very least you can do.

The infuriating email — reproduced in full below, because, wow, tone-deaf much? — was sent around the firm last week. It was designed to highlight the work that male partners have done at Paul Hastings to “champion” the cause of women. Above the Law got its hands on the email with this biting note:

Thanks to men, look what women can do at Paul Hastings

The email features glossy pictures of each of the nine male “champions,” has a bit of PR about their practice areas before featuring something good a woman has said about him. Let’s take a gander at all the “amazing” stuff these men have done for women, and realize just how low the bar really is:

They willingly gave me a seat at the table!

Standing in the corner was getting kinda awkward!

[He] shares the wealth of his knowledge with anyone willing to listen.

[He] is a true champion to women and men at the firm and is also just a nice guy!

He meets the basic requirements for a decent human!

[He] always values my opinion and input.

As a woman, I don’t have to be quiet!

[He] is always keen to include me in initiatives and listens to my voice.

He realizes he can bill me out at the same rate as my male counterpart!

Listen, I’m sure these are good people that probably even care about diversity in the workplace. But there is a way to handle and even promote allyship that doesn’t make it all about the men. One of the fundamental keys to being a [good ally](https://www.buzzfeed.com/anotherround/how-to-be-a-better-ally-an-open-letter-to-white-folks), in any context, is realizing it isn’t about you [the person with the privilege]. Certainly increasing gender diversity at the firm is something that men need to prioritize and take responsibility for, but casting men as the heroes that will save women from their own languishing careers misses the mark.

Notice how the focus isn’t on the great things women are able to do at Paul Hastings, in part, because of the mentorship they’ve received from the featured partners. It’s on the men and how wonderful they are simply because they’ve mentored women. Women have become the footnote in a story about women at the firm.

It’s a baffling logic that allows a feature about men “count” as outreach to women.

# Biglaw Arsonist Sentenced To 15 Years In Prison
## Only one lawyer was present when the fire broke out.

Back in December 2014, the Los Angeles office of Lewis Brisbois was [ravaged by an inferno](https://www.law360.com/articles/603093/lewis-brisbois-la-office-badly-damaged-by-fire), with flames climbing up to 50 feet in the air from the apartment complex next door, where the fire started. The Biglaw firm’s offices were very badly damaged, but not even the fiery blaze could stop attorneys at the then-largest law firm in the city from working — remotely, of course.

The fire was investigated as a criminal event, and Dawud Abdulwali emerged as a suspect. Abdulwali was charged with setting one of the largest structure fires in Los Angeles history, and originally pleaded not guilty in May 2015. Yesterday, under the terms of a negotiated plea deal, Abdulwali pleaded guilty to one count of arson and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/916759/arsonist-behind-lewis-brisbois-la-office-fire-gets-15-years) (sub. req.) has additional details:

The December 2014 fire, reportedly set as a response to police shootings in Ferguson, Missouri, and elsewhere, gutted the partially built, seven-story Da Vinci apartment complex and also damaged two nearby buildings, including the 16-story high-rise that housed the Los Angeles outpost of Lewis Brisbois, causing a total of $70 million to $90 million in estimated damages.

Heat from the fire shattered windows, and the fire spread to some of the floors of the building that housed the firm, the fire department said. The fire melted freeway signs and shut down two major freeways. No one was injured in the blaze.

“According to witness testimony at the preliminary hearing, Abdulwali set the unfinished building on fire as a response to the protests in Ferguson and other highly publicized cases of alleged police misconduct,” the [DA’s press release](http://da.co.la.ca.us/media/news/man-pleads-causing-multimillion-dollar-da-vinci-complex-blaze) said.

Thankfully (and perhaps surprisingly), only one attorney from Lewis Brisbois was present at the time the fire started, but the firm’s offices were so badly damaged that they were forced to relocate — and [file suit](https://www.law360.com/articles/798661/lewis-brisbois-sues-developer-over-fire-that-scorched-office) against the developers of the unfinished apartment building.

Tim Graves, managing partner of the firm’s Los Angeles office, said the fire was so bad that it burned the Lewis Brisbois sign at the top of the building. Here’s more information on the damage the firm sustained:

“The fire got so hot it burst all the windows out on that side of the building, melted some computers,” he said. “We had to of course move out.”

Graves said the firm’s offices also sustained serious damage when the fire safety sprinkler system went off throughout the entire building. He said the firm was fortunate that it was able to find new space so quickly, as it was fully moved into the U.S. Bank Tower offices that had previously housed Latham & Watkins LLP by the end of January 2015.

Graves said the firm was “still gathering” information about the potential monetary damages that had been caused by the fire.

Best of luck to Lewis Brisbois as the firm attempts to pursue its claims after the blaze. Litigators’ lawsuits are hotter than fire, so the defendants here may need an extinguisher by the time the firm is done roasting them in court.

# Bringing Change By Making Change: Changing The Culture Of Overwork In The Practice Of Law
## Lawyers, paralegals, and executive assistants are not machines. They are more than the hours that they work.

When I started my legal career in 2004 as a new associate for a midsize law firm, I had no illusions about the world I was entering. I knew that the law firm I had just joined expected its associates to put in enough time at the office each day to bill at least 1,800 to 2,000 hours by the end of the year. In order to satisfy that annual billable hour requirement, I knew that associates needed to be present in the office if they hoped to receive enough work assignments from senior associates and firm partners. I also knew that the law firm expected its associates to engage in unbillable activities over the course of the year that included business development and marketing. With those expectations in mind, I worked hard every day to meet those expectations. For me, meeting those expectations often meant missing family events, taking calls after normal work hours, and frequently missing dinner at night with my family. I found myself working in a culture of overwork.

While I knew I chose life as an associate, I also knew I did not have the wherewithal to sustain that life long term. I left the law firm in 2008 with the hope that I could find a job as a lawyer that would allow for a different life. As my career progressed, I did find jobs that allowed for a different life, but, oddly enough, my life really did not change. Why? The problem was no longer my employer. I was now the problem. I had begun to associate my worth and value by that amount of work that I did. I no longer had any boundaries. I was always “on.”

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In March 2020, all that changed because of a global pandemic. I was now a general counsel, responsible for leading a small legal team at a regional public university. Pre-pandemic, we left our personal lives at home. We worked longs hours in an office on campus. We worked at our desks. We ate at our desks. We left the office and took calls all hours of day and night. We even worked over the weekend.

Over the course of the pandemic, we experienced a shift. We stopped focusing on the hours worked and we started focusing on just getting the work done. While it was not always easy, we made a successful transition.  Remote offices and flexible schedules with an increased focus on mental, emotional, and physical health became our new normal. We gave and received grace each day as we moved from a work/life balance model to a work/life integration model.

Lawyers, paralegals, and executive assistants are not machines. They are more than the hours that they work. As leaders, we really need to work to change the way we practice law. The culture of overwork continues because the businesses for which we work get more from us for less and because businesses promote those lawyers who overwork to positions of  leadership.

Overwork is not healthy. It kills our focus. We all need space to rest, relax, and recharge. When we fail to do those things, we lose the ability to think critically and find solutions, and we lose the ability to be patient and empathetic.

As we move past pandemic, we cannot return to our past ways.  As leaders, we need to consider permanently changing our policies. We need to model boundary setting, and we need to show that we value people who take time to enjoy life outside of work. We need to recognize the importance of being able to plan, prioritize, and successfully achieve positive outcomes. We need to care about the team’s collective well-being. Overwork only exists because we allow it to exist. We all need to be part of the solution and not the problem.  We have a unique opportunity to bring a permanent change to the practice of law.  Let us not waste it.

Listen… the legal profession isn’t exactly hitting it out of the park when it comes to diversity. But some Biglaw firms are doing a  better job than others, and the ALM Diversity Scorecard measures that. The [Diversity Scorecard](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/05/28/the-2019-diversity-scorecard/) tracks the average number of full-time-equivalent minority attorneys at Am Law 200 and National Law Journal 250 law firms in the calendar year 2018.

The firm that took top honors this year — Fragomen — is a newcomer to the top spot, pushing White & Case to #2 after five years at the top. Overall, 55 firms boast a minimum of 20 percent minority attorneys, which is an improvement over last year’s numbers which had 43 firms at that benchmark.

You can check out the full rankings, as well as a breakout of demographics, at Law.com. But in the meantime, here are the Top 25 firms on the Diversity Scorecard.

# NY Post Shocked To Learn Biglaw Works Paralegals To The Bone
## Why do we have to explain ""Biglaw works hard"" to people every few months?

As a publication that aims toward the masses and can’t quite decide where it falls on the spectrum from serious local paper to TMZ print edition, it’s not particularly shocking that the New York Post’s angle on this story is tailored to evoke outrage from the readers that some “kid” could possibly make so much money.

“[Paralegal for Sears bankruptcy case billed $174K in one month](https://nypost.com/2019/01/23/paralegal-for-sears-bankruptcy-case-made-174k-in-one-month/),” reads the headline to a story posted last night about Keri Grant, a paralegal at Weil who racked up 431 hours at $405/hour in November. We’ll get you and mangle you indeed.

Except, of course, Grant didn’t make that much money. There’s a healthy gap between billing rates and realized compensation and even with a hefty overtime check, Grant didn’t take home anything close to that. Well into the story, long after the story lost that segment of Post readers who only came for Giants draft rumors and some excuse to spend the day telling everyone that “Blue Lives Matter” — which is to say most of the Post’s audience — the article quotes a bankruptcy expert explaining how entirely normal this bill looks to anyone who’s ever worked on a disaster as massive as the demise of Sears.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

This happens every few months. The media had a similar freakout to learn that [Barbara Jones could bill $47K in a month of grinding through Cohen’s emails](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/yes-this-is-how-much-a-biglaw-partner-working-for-one-week-bills/).

But the damage was done. More bellyaching about how “lawyers are all crooks” and misplaced class rage that manages to get more worked up that a young college graduate is billing $405 to work 14-hour days including weekends and holidays on a tight deadline than the fact that a multibillionaire purchased and destroyed one of America’s most venerable institutions so he could professionally masturbate to Ayn Rand for a few years.

If that reference seemed extreme to you, I promise it’s so much [more apt than you can imagine](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-11/at-sears-eddie-lamperts-warring-divisions-model-adds-to-the-troubles):

Lampert runs Sears like a hedge fund portfolio, with dozens of autonomous businesses competing for his attention and money. An outspoken advocate of free-market economics and fan of the novelist Ayn Rand, he created the model because he expected the invisible hand of the market to drive better results. If the company’s leaders were told to act selfishly, he argued, they would run their divisions in a rational manner, boosting overall performance.

If I were a hack writer on the Internet, this is where I’d say, “you’ll never guess what happened next.” Since I am, in fact, a hack writer on the Internet: YOU’LL NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT! The various departments within Sears began viciously attacking each other, seeing the path toward success defined by garroting their internal rivals. Soon the company was in a death spiral that ended here.

But certainly don’t feel bad for Eddie Lampert! With the aid of the nation’s approach to corporate structure and bankruptcy laws, Lampert looks to [make money off this deal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paularosenblum/2018/10/10/sears-plunges-towards-chapter-11-lampert-stands-to-win-whatever-happens/#7a9ecd9b5237). In an irony that Lampert could not possibly understand, he’s at best a Rand villain — a moocher who makes his money by manipulating the government’s arcane rules to protect investors like Lampert from the vagaries of an actual free market.

This is where we are. There’s more scandalous interest in a professional billing thousands of dollars than a stunted fail child destroying the livelihoods of thousands of people and getting millions for it. Way to go. USA! USA! USA!

# Lateral Attorney Hiring In A Softening Economy: Diverging Trends Across Practice Areas

2022 [saw a pullback](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/12/year-end-lateral-activity-swings-toward-the-normal-with-litigators-now-in-demand) in lateral attorney hiring, as inflation and high interest rates slowed corporate and lending activity, and as law firms found themselves overstaffed after record hiring in 2021.  Unfortunately, we have also seen recent associate layoffs, mainly by firms particularly dependent on the currently beleaguered tech sector.  Despite these developments, overall lateral attorney hiring levels are currently more reflective of pre-pandemic lateral attorney hiring than a full-fledged recession.

Certain practices and industry sectors have featured continued demand for mid- through senior-level associates, counsel, and partner-level attorneys.  As we enter 2023, depending on the length of the economic slowdown and whether inflationary pressures subside, we would ideally see a continuation of current lateral attorney hiring levels followed by an uptick later in the year, tracking a resurgence in business activity.

2022 Lateral Hiring Trends Compared to Previous Years

With 2021’s economic recovery spurring exorbitant deal-flow, associate hiring increased to historically high levels, especially in transactional practice areas.  In 2022, there was a 20% year-over-year decrease in lateral associate hiring by Am Law 200 firms, with 8,116 total hires compared to 10,179 hires in 2021.  In the second half of the year, as the economic slowdown became more evident, there was a 45% year-over-year decrease in Am Law 200 associate hiring versus 2021.

While the 2022 decrease in Am Law 200 law firm associate hiring was substantial compared to the aberrational hiring levels during the same time period in 2021, when putting these numbers into [historical context](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/12/year-end-lateral-activity-swings-toward-the-normal-with-litigators-now-in-demand/), 2022 associate hiring levels were consistent with those in the years preceding the pandemic when the economy was relatively healthy.  Am Law 200 associate hiring in the second half of 2022 was 7% higher than the five-year average for the same period during the pre-pandemic years of 2015 through 2019.  Mirroring the resilience of the broader labor market, the lateral attorney hiring market endures, although practice area demand has adjusted due to distress in certain segments of the economy.

Corporate Transactions, Finance, and Real Estate

The economic challenges of 2022 have had the most impact on corporate transactional practice areas.  There was a precipitous decline in deal activity in 2022, including a [fall in strategic M&A](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-with-no-q4-surge-2022-m-a-activity-limped-to-a-close) and capital markets offerings due to interest rate increases and market volatility.  2022 had the lowest Q4 global M&A deal volume in the last six years.  Even so, private equity-backed M&A remained steady, with PE [leveraged buyouts](https://www.axios.com/2023/01/03/lbos-just-had-a-huge-year) notching their second-busiest year in a decade.  Deal activity was driven by PE firms holding record levels of committed capital (“dry powder”), attractive target company pricing, and private debt fund financing.

These market developments are reflected in 2022 lateral attorney hiring and in current demand.  We are seeing very few mid-level M&A associate openings in public company and strategic M&A-centric corporate practice groups.  However, we still see consistent openings for mid-level private equity M&A associates with corporate practice groups representing large-cap and upper middle market PE sponsors.

Associates experiencing a slowdown in non-PE M&A corporate practice groups may wish to explore such PE M&A associate positions, as strategic M&A primary and ancillary document drafting experience is directly transferable.  Capital markets and securities associate hiring has diminished substantially more than M&A, with very few openings nationally. Due to rising interest rates, stock market volatility, and lending costs, the IPO and global debt offerings markets collapsed to historic lows in 2022.  While we have not yet seen many publicly acknowledged layoffs of corporate M&A or securities associates, there were reports of stealth layoffs during this past review season.

Tech and emerging companies and venture capital (ECVC) corporate practice groups were perhaps the most detrimentally impacted by the global economic downturn in 2022.  Rising interest rates and borrowing costs, lower stock prices, geopolitical tensions, and other factors have halted tech company expansion, spurred austerity measures, and caused VC funding to fall to pandemic period lows.  Over the past two quarters, the decrease in demand for tech company legal guidance has led to associate and staff layoffs in practice groups servicing tech companies and VC sponsors.  Associates affected by these layoffs may look to transition into other corporate practice areas in which their core corporate transactional experience would be transferable.

While on a smaller scale than in 2021, we are still seeing demand for mid- through senior-level commercial finance associates. As leveraged finance transactions by investment banks have retrenched, private equity firms have increasingly turned to the [private credit market](https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-deals-are-going-private-leaving-wall-street-in-the-cold-11672267837?mod=article_inline) to finance acquisitions, thereby providing a steady deal-flow for certain commercial lending practice groups.  There have also been recent lateral associate structured finance and securitization openings, though demand has decreased significantly since 2021 due to slow growth and higher interest rates.

Investment funds groups are still hiring relatively actively, with openings for associates across all levels.  While private equity, venture capital, and other fundraising [slowed significantly](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/fund-launches-cratered-in-2022-private-equity-s-share-of-terminated-deals-grows-73723322) in 2022, certain sectors have remained busy.  Real estate fundraising slowed while investment in infrastructure and energy funds [remained active](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/08/15/even-with-ma-down-investment-funds-work-is-up-law-firms-are-taking-notice/) relative to previous years.  Further, although private equity firms and other sponsors are taking longer to raise capital in the current environment, that does not substantially decrease the amount of legal structuring or regulatory guidance needed for active fund management. Because fewer associates have funds training, relative to other corporate specialties, many investment funds practice groups are short of talent.

In real estate, we are still seeing demand for mid- through senior-level lateral associates, with steady commercial deal activity and some high-performing asset classes.  For example, in Q3 2022, although commercial real estate deal activity was down compared to the same quarter in 2021, deal activity was [6% higher](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/library/asset-wealth-management-real-estate-deals-outlook.html) than in Q3 2019.  Transactions involving industrial property have been particularly active due to the continued growth of e-commerce and inventory surpluses from supply chain constraints.

Litigation

Litigation is less sensitive to recessions and decreased corporate activity, exhibiting reduced but stable demand for lateral associates this past year.  Litigation was the second-best performing practice area in 2022, with midsize firms seeing a slight uptick in litigation demand and many experts [predicting an uptick](https://www.law.com/litigationdaily/2022/11/08/whats-the-litigation-outlook-as-legal-industry-faces-an-economic-inflection-point/) in M&A disputes for 2023.  We are seeing litigation lateral associate positions fairly evenly divided between: (1) general commercial and tort litigation (breach of contract, products liability related class actions); and (2) white collar criminal (particularly False Claims Act-focused) and other securities and antitrust litigation.

Litigation practice leaders are [anticipating increased government enforcement](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/big-firm-litigators-are-amped-up-2023-2022-12-30/) in 2023, with a quicker pace of proceedings following two years of the Biden administration adding personnel and instituting new policy directives.  Law firm practice leaders and plaintiffs’ attorneys are also anticipating increased consumer privacy class action activity, with large tech companies recently having agreed to substantial public consumer class action settlements.

IP

Intellectual property litigation has remained busy, and firms [have significantly invested](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2022/12/13/big-law-makes-big-bets-on-ip-litigation-despite-tech-downturn/) in partner and associate hiring, banking on IP as a practice that is less elastic to economic conditions.  Courts are seeing an influx of patent cases that built up during the pandemic.  In addition to litigation involving the more commonly disputed technologies, such as software, semiconductors, and electronic devices, new technologies such as artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and battery technologies are emerging in patent disputes.

Given the scarcity of IP associates with the requisite engineering backgrounds, we have seen continued patent prosecution lateral associate positions, though in much lower volume than IP litigation openings.  Global patent filings have seen a [significant decrease](https://ttconsultants.com/patent-application-in-inflationary-times-2022/) over the past year due to the economic slowdown, with companies seeking to avoid patent filing costs and maintenance fees.

With respect to life science patents, we are seeing associate openings in both prosecution and litigation.  Biotech, pharmaceutical, and healthcare companies have [continued filing patents](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2022/08/25/boston-area-biotech-boom-keeps-ip-focused-law-firm.html) and were bolstered by some pandemic-derived technologies, including developments in vaccines, immunology, and telemedicine.

Countercyclical Practice Areas: Restructuring and Labor & Employment

While we have seen an [uptick in restructuring](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/20/2023-bankruptcy-outlook-rising-interest-rates-lift-all-restructuring-practices/) associate positions, openings have not risen to the level we typically see during major economic downturns.  There were a significant number of [corporate bankruptcy filings](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/bankruptcies-industry-excerpt-trends-large-corporate-bankruptcy-and-financial) in 2022, but Chapter 11 filings have remained slow since 2021.  Prior to 2022, government stimulus programs, low borrowing rates, and high debt forbearance contributed to the corporate bankruptcy filing slowdown by assisting distressed companies.  As these protections dissipate, law firms are fielding more inquiries from clients of over-leveraged companies.  Crypto, life sciences, and healthcare are primary sectors currently driving restructuring.

Labor and employment is another hallmark countercyclical practice area, as layoffs and other workforce changes can drive increased employment litigation.  There is particularly strong demand for associates experienced in wage and hour class and collective actions as well as discrimination cases. 

While the lateral attorney job market is broadly experiencing a slowdown, certain practice areas have persistent need for top associate talent.  Should the economy achieve a soft landing, we hope to see the reemergence of transactional practice area hiring in 2023.

# Do Biglaw's Long Hours Need A 'Trigger Warning'? After The Death Of A Partner, This Lawyer Says Yes
## A partner's death is making lawyers reassess the long hours that are often required to complete the work at Biglaw firms.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

That is a massive amount of work on any basis. That is an amount of work that should send a trigger warning and that person needs to be spoken to and looked after as appropriate.

Those sort of hours are massive – I suspect I won’t be hugely popular for saying things like that but if we are to address this then these are the things that need to be looked at.

— Colin Passmore, chairman of the City of London Law Society, in comments noted by the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13283257/Law-firms-trigger-warnings-mental-health-lawyers-City.html), on the level of work that the late Vanessa Ford, senior partner at Pinsent Masons, had been working prior to her [death while she suffered from an “acute mental health crisis.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/biglaw-partner-suffered-from-acute-mental-health-crisis-before-her-tragic-death/) Some lawyers, like Ford, work more than 3,000 hours a year, and Passmore said this should “cause concern among management.”

He looks lonely, doesn’t he? (Photo by BRYAN R. SMITH/AFP/Getty Images)

On ABC News, [George Stephanapolous is reporting](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-cooperate-attorneys-leave-case/story?id=55861988) that longtime Trump fixer Michael Cohen needs a new lawyer.

Cohen is under investigation for a host of potential crimes. So far, he has been [represented by Stephen Ryan](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/the-biglaw-firms-potentially-caught-in-the-cohen-raid/) of McDermott Will & Emery. Apparently, that representation is at an end:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As attorneys for Michael Cohen rush to meet Judge Kimba Wood’s Friday deadline to complete a privilege review of over 3.7 million documents seized in the April 9 raids of Cohen’s New York properties and law office, a source representing this matter has disclosed to ABC News that the law firm handling the case for Cohen is not expected to represent him going forward…

Cohen, now with no legal representation, is likely to cooperate with federal prosecutors in New York, sources said. This development, which is believed to be imminent, will likely hit the White House, family members, staffers and counsels hard.

It’s certainly possible that Cohen is preparing to cooperate with investigators, and so a firm like McDermott Will & Emery is no longer needed. Cohen will still need a lawyer, even if he chooses to cooperate, but not one as expensive or august as the lawyers at MWE.

That’s actually the nicest possible spin on the move.

Another entirely possible scenario is that Cohen is broke and can no longer afford a prestigious firm like McDermott. I mean, it’s not like MWE is representing Cohen pro bono. The payment Cohen allegedly made to Stormy Daniels — for which he allegedly borrowed against his house to pay — is chump change compared to Cohen’s mounting legal bills. Remember, McDermott attorneys have had less than three months to review 3.7 million documents seized from Cohen’s offices. It’s doable, but very expensive. [We’ve already seen the bills from Barbara Jones](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/yes-this-is-how-much-a-biglaw-partner-working-for-one-week-bills/), the special master in charge of reviewing potentially privileged documents. I promise you MWE is not giving Cohen a discount.

Here’s another theory. It’s wishful thinking, but maybe McDermott is embarrassed and no longer wants to be associated with Trump world. Remember, Jones Day — the law firm most closely associated with Donald Trump’s shenanigans — [has taken a massive reputational hit](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/above-the-law-power-100-law-firm-rankings-are-out/). The next generation of lawyers is watching, and being in charge of making bad legal arguments for a despised bigot who happens to be president is no fun.

McDermott has been off to the side. Their people are not in the actual administration, as Jones Day’s Don McGahn is. Their representation of Cohen is adjacent to the Mueller probe, as opposed to directly in its line of fire.

But still, now that they’ve seen the documents the government is about to have on Cohen… maybe this is a good time for the firm to get out. There are plenty of wealthy white-collar criminals out there to represent who won’t make the firm look as bad.

Or maybe Cohen is going to represent himself going forward. He appears to be a very bad attorney, and nothing says “bad lawyer” more than representing yourself when you are a target of a massive federal investigation.

I think the first answer is still the most likely. McDermott is out. Cohen is about to turn over the state’s evidence. Donald Trump Tweetstorm in 3…2…1…

# Time To Pay Up: These Am Law Top 50 Firms Haven’t Announced Raises Yet
## These firms have the money -- they just haven't decided to spend it on associates yet.

It’s the beginning of the second full week of Biglaw’s summer 2021 salary wars, and while news about raises to the $205K salary scale continues at a rapid pace, dozens upon dozens of firms have remained completely silent. Why? The market (i.e., all of the firms that have matched the generous Davis Polk scale, including Cravath) has already spoken — very loudly, in fact. There aren’t any decisions left to be made… except, of course, whether or not your firm is planning to stiff associates.

Which firms in the Am Law 50 haven’t uttered a word (that we know of) to their associates about raises yet? Here’s a list of the firms that have yet to match (along with their most recent gross revenue, as of 2020). Do with it what you will, and please feel free to correct us if we’re wrong.

Yet, despite the lackluster results reactive management inevitably brings, we lawyers just can’t seem to help ourselves. Most law firm leadership positions are occupied by full-time practitioners. They’re often successful attorneys with thriving books of business squeezing in management part time where they’re able. People billing thousands of hours per year need to find an efficient way to make decisions, and it’s often easiest to wait and see what other firms are doing before committing to a new course of action.

You’ll be hard-pressed to find a game-changing company operated in the same way as most law firms. Breakaway success in business almost always comes from doing things differently — not following the pack. Bill Gates didn’t try to make a better typewriter. Elon Musk didn’t try to reinvent the gas-powered car (though what happens with his purchase of Twitter, assuming it happens, remains to be seen). YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki isn’t doubling down on bunny ears for TVs. All of these leaders and companies blazed trails in their respective industries.

So where does the idea for the next big innovation come from? To find it, law firm managers often circulate within their firm, seeking out perspective and ideas from their partnership. There is tremendous value in this exercise. Law firm partners are, in general, smart, driven, thoughtful people with good insights to share. In fact, law firm leaders would be making a huge mistake not to talk to and listen carefully to their partners.

At the same time, lawyers tend to speak with the same people, follow similar legal news sources, and think about similar problems. We often have a valuable but limited view of the world. And it’s often a view that most of our competitors share. If we want to find real opportunities to break out from the pack and differentiate our firms, we as managers need to be proactively looking outside of our firms — and the profession entirely.

It’s All About The Process

I’m currently finalizing a master’s thesis at Cambridge Judge Business School.  For a topic, I chose a problem close to home: how established law firms can use entrepreneurial strategies to infuse innovation. As part of my research, I’ve interviewed 26 business leaders, including Biglaw MPs, LegalTech CEOs, academics, legal futurists, and business leaders entirely removed from the legal realm.

Literally every conversation provided me with some valuable insight on how to build a stronger firm and business. I ended up with hundreds of pages of transcripts, notes, and actionable strategies from just a couple dozen conversations. Law firm leaders can learn similar insights by simply talking to leaders outside of the Biglaw bubble.

The goal isn’t to copy and paste concepts from one business to another. The real magic usually isn’t a company’s winning product or service, but rather the process it utilized to create it. The best ideas are rarely generated haphazardly. It’s the businesses that systemize innovation, experimentation, trial and error, and iteration that continue to crank out gold.

By learning how other industries are solving their unique problems, we build up our own toolbox of problem-solving techniques.  Heck, there’s even value in just learning what types of problems other industries face, because doing so helps us better anticipate and head off problems we might run into ourselves.

Lunching Your Way To Success

So, where does a law firm leader hoping to build their innovation toolbox start? Biglaw firms have one abundant resource by definition: clients. Many firms have thousands, or tens of thousands, of clients — all with their own ideas, challenges, histories, and successes to learn from. Tap into that resource. What client wouldn’t love to have their lawyer take them out to lunch just to show some interest and learn how to serve them better?

If you met up with one client a week, within six months you’d have conducted enough interviews to fill your own master’s thesis. It will take a lot less time than that before you start seeing your own firm and its challenges in new, unexpected ways — and you might even generate some new business for your firm along the way.

So stop managing like a lawyer and start setting up lunches. It might just be the first step toward your firm jumping ahead of the pack.

# Nationwide Pay Raise Watch: A Biglaw Firm Moves (Closer) To Market
## This is good news -- but does it mean anything for the broader Biglaw market?

Welcome to the latest installment of [Nationwide Pay Raise Watch](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/nationwide-pay-raise-watch/). Everyone is still waiting on [“NY to 190”](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ny-to-190/) — and, I suspect, will be waiting for a while — but over the past year, we’ve seen smaller signs of tightening in the Biglaw labor market, in terms of pay raises in pockets of the profession.

The Philadelphia market [went to a $160,000 starting salary](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-philadelphia-to-160k-this-time-for-real/), and Wilmington followed [near the end of last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/delaware-moves-to-160k-new-york-should-be-embarrassed/). Pacific Northwest firms also [raised pay a bit](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/another-market-bumps-up-associate-salaries/), even if not to $160,000. And now we get this news, from an [Am Law 100 firm](http://www.americanlawyer.com/law-firm-profiles-result?firmname=Holland+%26+Knight&slreturn=20160231162218) that’s more than 1,000 lawyers strong:

[Holland & Knight](https://abovethelaw.com/holland-knight/) has finally gone to market (kind of). First and second years are at market, and everyone else is at ‘market range.’ For example, if market is $250,000 for a 6th year, at H&K you can fall between a range of $200,000 and $250,000.

First-years in the top market cities are making $160,000, second-years $170,000, third-years anywhere between $170,000 and $185,000 etc. The ranges get a bit wider as you go up. Then you hit year 9 and it’s ‘discretionary’

People generally seem to be happy about this change, especially the new associates. Higher-level associates are happyish, but obviously would have preferred just going to market.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We reached out to the firm, which issued the following statement through a spokesperson:

We’ve raised first-year salaries in all of our offices except Denver, which opened just a little over a year ago. In our major markets, we increased first-year salaries from $145,000 to $160,000.

So that’s good news. Congrats, H&K associates.

But does it mean anything for the broader Biglaw market? Or will New York and the other major markets remain stuck with the Simpson Thacher pay scale that dates [all the way back to January 2007](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/) (i.e., more than nine years ago)?

# U.K. Firm Scoops Up Entire Office Of Beleaguered Biglaw Shop

We told you [last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/what-does-the-mass-exodus-of-partners-at-this-biglaw-firm-mean/) that something is up at Sedgwick. They are losing partners and senior attorneys left and right. A handful to Drinker Biddle, a few to Robinson & Cole, a couple to Mintz Levin — the list is extensive. One firm that has repeatedly fed off of Sedgwick lawyers is U.K. firm Kennedys.

Bolstered by an 8 percent increase in gross revenue [over the previous year, ](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2016/06/29/kennedys-turnover-jumps-by-7-as-uk-revenue-tops-100m/)Kennedys has been growing as rapidly as Mark McGwire in 1992. Besides taking office managing partners (along with other lawyers) from the New York and Chicago offices of Sedgwick, they’ve also used mergers and a few Mayer Brown attorneys to boost their numbers. Now, as [reported by Law.com](http://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/10/23/kennedys-takes-bermuda-based-sedgwick-office-as-part-of-continued-global-expansion/), comes word that they’re taking on the entirety of Sedgwick affiliate, Bermuda-based Sedgwick Chudleigh Ltd.:

“This arrangement provides us with the opportunity to service clients in Bermuda, the [U.S.] and the U.K., as well as our numerous other locations globally. It significantly augments our global insurance practice and puts us in a class of one amongst insurance law firms,” said a statement by Kennedys senior partner Nick Thomas.

So, what’s really going on at Sedgwick? Is the firm prepping for a merger? Or is something more ominous on the horizon? If you know anything about the exodus of lawyers from Sedgwick, feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Sedgwick), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)).

# Arguing Before SCOTUS: An Advocate's Perspective

Kannon Shanmugam (via YouTube)

One question I often get asked, as a lawyer turned [writer/editor/speaker](http://davidlat.com), is whether I miss practicing law. In general, no. But if I could return to active practice for one experience, I’d want to argue before the United States Supreme Court.

What is it like to appear before SCOTUS, and how has the experience changed over the years? Earlier this week, I attended a talk hosted by the Columbia Federalist Society entitled [Arguing Before the Supreme Court](https://fedsoc.org/events/arguing-before-the-supreme-court), featuring one of the nation’s top Supreme Court advocates: [Kannon Shanmugam](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/kannon-k-shanmugam), chair of the new Supreme Court and appellate practice at Paul Weiss. (I also wound up offering commentary on Shanmugam’s talk after former Solicitor General [Don Verrilli](https://www.mto.com/lawyers/donald-b-verrilli-jr), who was originally scheduled to serve as commentator, was unable to attend.)

As regular readers of ATL will recall, in January Shanmugam [left Williams & Connolly](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/paul-weiss-launches-supreme-court-practice-as-press-spotlight-returns-to-partnership-diversity/), his professional home [for more than a decade](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/09/musical-chairs-kannon-shanmugam-to-williams-connollywcs-first-lateral-partner-in-22-years/), to launch an appellate and Supreme Court practice for Paul Weiss. What motivated his move? If I had to guess, I’d cite three factors: (1) the chance to build an appellate/SCOTUS practice from the ground up, as he did at Williams & Connolly, but this time within the context of a global, full-service law firm; (2) the opportunity to get involved in law firm management, as managing partner of Paul Weiss’s D.C. office, which is looking to grow; and (3) big bucks. (Paul Weiss profits per partner hit an eye-popping $5 million in 2018, which is around three times the [estimated PPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_US_law_firms_by_profits_per_partner) at Williams & Connolly.)

Shanmugam has argued a whopping 27 cases before the Supreme Court — and, like many top SCOTUS practitioners, he got his start arguing before the Court when he served in the Solicitor General’s Office. But that wasn’t his first exposure to high-court argument; he previously clerked for the late Justice Antonin Scalia.

As Shanmugam explained during his talk — which he delivered without notes, speaking in what seemed like full paragraphs — his former boss transformed oral argument at the Court. If you listen to recordings of SCOTUS arguments from decades ago, which is quite fun — and which you can do over at the indispensable [Oyez](https://www.oyez.org/), among other places — you’ll notice the difference between the “B.S.” and “A.S.” periods (my terms, not Shanmugam’s). Before Scalia, advocates would often go on for minutes at a time without interruption from the justices. After Scalia, advocates typically get confronted with questions right out of the gate, and spend most of their argument time fielding queries from the justices.

Justice Scalia took a Socratic approach to oral argument, Shanmugam said. The justice didn’t spend a huge amount of time poring over the briefs before the argument; instead, he wanted the opportunity to explore the case fully through interchange with the advocates.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The term that appellate advocates use to refer to judges or justices with tons of questions is a “hot bench” — and as Shanmugam noted, the Supreme Court bench has only gotten hotter over the years. Pretty much every justice on the current Court replaced a justice who was less active as a questioner (with the possible exception of Justice Clarence Thomas — but even he [broke his silence](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/clarence-thomas-speaks-for-the-first-time-in-3-years/) recently).

This approach to oral argument has spread from the Supreme Court to the circuit courts (which might not be surprising, given how many circuit judges [clerked for the Court themselves](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/11/21/former-scotus-clerks-dominate-the-ranks-of-trumps-judicial-nominees/)). So advocates have had to adapt, and now must be prepared for rapid-fire questioning before both the high court and lower courts.

What does this mean for how lawyers prepare for argument? Yes, moot courts are important, and Shanmugam does at least two before every argument. But the core of his preparation is thinking about the hardest questions for his side and how to best answer them.

Responding to tough questions is also done through the briefs, of course. Shanmugam explained the difference between briefing and oral argument in this way: “The briefing is about why you should win, and the argument is about why the justices should want to rule for your side.”

And how do you get the justices on your side? Because of the active and frequently non-linear questioning, it’s hard for a lawyer to argue in the same organized, logical manner of the briefs. As a result, much of the skill of being a Supreme Court advocate involves turning hostile questions to your advantage and using them to pivot to your positive points.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
What can we expect from the Court’s newest member, Justice Brett Kavanaugh? Shanmugam said that Justice Kavanaugh seems to have made a smooth transition from the D.C. Circuit to SCOTUS (which isn’t always the case for justices in the first few months on the Court). He seems comfortable and well-prepared on the bench, participating actively in argument without being overbearing.

In terms of jurisprudence, Shanmugam expects Justice Kavanaugh to end up pretty close to Justice Scalia (although maybe not as close to Justice Scalia as Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, who filled Scalia’s former seat). Justice Kavanaugh places great weight on constitutional and statutory text — not surprising, given his [previously expressed views](https://harvardlawreview.org/2016/06/fixing-statutory-interpretation/) on interpretation — but he might be a little more pragmatic and flexible than Justice Scalia in his approach. For example, some of Justice Kavanaugh’s questions have delved into the history of a statute’s development, which was not often seen from Justice Scalia, the most famous critic of the use of legislative history. (Shanmugam did offer the caveat, though, that one shouldn’t read too much into oral argument; just because a justice asks about a certain subject at argument doesn’t mean she will consider it when deciding the case or writing the opinion.)

Of course, a full assessment of Justice Kavanaugh will have to wait until he’s decided more cases, especially hot-button or high-profile ones. The current Term, in Shanmugam’s view, is not exactly overflowing with big-ticket cases. Some have wondered whether this might be intentional, the result of the Court deciding to duck a lot of controversial issues in the wake of the heated confirmation process for Justice Kavanaugh. But Shanmugam didn’t put much stock in that theory, noting that some Terms are just more exciting than others. (I share this view; it seems to me that the Terms seem to alternate, with an exciting Term followed by a sleepy one.)

So not all Supreme Court Terms are created equal, and not all cases are either. But if you have the privilege of arguing before the Court in any case, no matter how boring, treasure it. Only a tiny, tiny fraction of American lawyers get to argue before the Supreme Court even once — to say nothing of 27 times.

On the other hand, these appear to be lockstep bonuses, as opposed to Weil’s annual Fall bonus structure which [they tied directly to hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/weil-offers-a-new-take-on-fall-bonuses-theyre-hours-based-and-theyre-huge/).

# Breaking Up With Biglaw
## If you realize that your entire life is consumed by work, it may be time to say goodbye to Biglaw.

I used to look out at the Hudson from the window of my beautiful office at a Biglaw firm in Manhattan and pinch myself, not believing that I had made it.

As a young associate, I had a passion for making connections and building relationships. I quickly realized that such skills would set me up for success as a partner. But our practice group was busy, and we had a ton of clients that I had to service. Of course, as all associates are, I was brought in to bill and work.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I was newly married and had just bought a house in the suburbs without any kids.  Before I took the job, my husband and I had a serious conversation, where we candidly discussed what our future would look like if I took this job and if we started a family. I would be over an hour away from our kids, and my husband would be the one on duty if he needed to run over to daycare, take them to the doctor, or just be the contact at home. I would have to skip school events for work. I would be the one commuting into the city on a Saturday if we had a major case to work on. I would not see them for days at a time, because I would be on a bus before they would wake up, and I’d get home when they were already asleep.  I would miss family functions for work. We talked it all out, and as DINK (dual-income, no kids) couple, we decided that it would be done.

I signed my name on the dotted line, and thus began my Biglaw journey.  I hit the ground running, eager to be a part of my team and absorb everything like a sponge. I said yes as much as I could, worked as much as I could, and did the best that I could. I was committed to a career in Biglaw, and was out to prove to the world that I could be a great wife, friend, lawyer, and a mom (one day). Things went really well for a while. I was able to balance my life outside of work with the high annual billable requirement. This was on top of all of the nonbillable work I was doing to help build the practice because I wanted to be a partner there, so I put in the energy as if it were my own business. We became so busy that over time, I started having to cancel dinners with friends, weekend plans, doctors’ appointments, and the like, all for work. I canceled a vacation and skipped weddings.

And then I forgot to RSVP to one of my best friend’s baby showers. I didn’t realize how big of a deal it was at the time, but my friends reached out to me very upset and concerned. The words flew out of my mouth, “I’m so sorry. I’m slammed at work. I completely forgot.” And that’s when I realized my entire life was consumed by work.

The first panic attack I ever had was in the middle of the day. I felt the office spin around me, and I had to go outside for a walk. I came back inside after, sat down at the desk, and immediately began to sob. And I couldn’t stop. It was 2 p.m. on a Friday, when I usually worked until 6 or 7, but I packed up my things and went home.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

I came home and still could not turn off the water works. I had no idea why I was crying. I went to log back into my computer when my husband stopped me and, with a warm smile, suggested that we instead walk over to an Italian restaurant.  We enjoyed an early Friday dinner together for the first time in a while.

The next day, I accepted that I had hit burnout. And it was no one’s fault but my own. I had gotten myself there. The Biglaw machine can be intense, but it also can be a refuge for associates who want resources, support, and partners that are willing to train them. I had everything I could’ve wanted at my firm. But what I didn’t have was control over my life. I realized my current lifestyle was not sustainable and that I needed a change.

I knew then that it was time for me to start a new chapter and say goodbye to big law.

I ended up moving to a boutique firm that gave me the flexibility to build a practice and start a family, all on my own terms. I realize now that life comes in seasons, and am grateful that I listened to my mind and body to begin the next chapter in my law career.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Hint: Reserving that percentage of profits for partner bonuses (which is almost twice what most Biglaw firms save for that purpose) allows the firm to pay its top performers in the range of $12 million to $15 million.

See the answer on the next page.

# The Size Of Biglaw Partnership Classes Is Shrinking
## Bad news if you're trying to go for that brass ring.

Making partner at a Biglaw firm is the brass ring many a law school gunner has been aiming for. But getting to that level is getting increasingly difficult. According to a[ report](https://www.law.com/2019/02/05/partnership-classes-are-shrinking-hampering-advancement-and-diversity/) from Law.com at AmLaw 200 firms the total number of promotions to partner has fallen over the last few years (since 2015) — a whopping 28.8 percent! In fact, 2018 was the smallest partnership class in 5 years.

It turns out if you have your eye on partnership you need to be more than an excellent lawyer:

“As a homegrown lawyer, it’s harder and harder to make equity partner,” says Kent Zimmermann, a law firm management consultant at the Zeughauser Group. “The bar has been going up, and it’s not good enough to just be a really high-quality lawyer anymore at most firms. You usually need to be highly productive in both doing the work and bringing the work in.”

And it’s more than just a bummer to folks that really want to make partner — it’s also hurting firms’ diversity efforts. Though there isn’t data available on the racial breakdown of partnership classes (but we’ve got [plenty of anecdotal evidence](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/paul-weiss-press-release-captures-everything-broken-about-biglaw-in-one-image/)), we do know the number of women making partner at AmLaw 200 firm was at a 5 year low last year — that means the goal of women making up 50 percent of the overall partnership class is further away than ever:

For over 10 years, the ratio of women to men entering law firms from law schools has been 1-to-1, and it was thought that, by now, women would make up 50 percent of partnership classes, says Sarretta McDonough, president of the National Association of Women Lawyers.

“It just demonstrates that law firms are not doing a good job of creating homegrown talent and making them partner,” McDonough says.

So what’s behind the low partnership number? Well, a lot of things. Firms desire to keep their profitability, and those all important PPP (profits per partner) numbers up. Not wanting to wait for new partners to find their rainmaking footing, many firms are looking to the white hot lateral market — as McDonough notes, “I fear that we’re playing musical chairs with a lot of limited lawyers and limited partners.” Plus, a lot of the older partners just don’t want to retire:

“The financial crisis in ‘08 hurt the retirement plans of a large swath of partners who feel the need to keep earning and try to hold on at their firms, even though they’re underproductive, and some firms are permissive of those people hanging on,” Zimmermann says.

So yes, even though the attorneys that are up for partner may have survived the lean financial crisis years, it is still wreaking havoc on the trajectory of their career.

# Mother Knows Best: Gloria Allred Disses Daughter's Decision To Rep Harvey Weinstein
## Could Gloria Allred end up litigating against her daughter?

UPDATE: Mother really did know best. [Lisa Bloom has resigned](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/07/556379371/lawyer-lisa-bloom-resigns-as-harvey-weinstein-adviser).

Gloria Allred is less than enthusiastic about her daughter’s decision [to represent Harvey Weinstein](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/what-lawyer-would-you-hire-if-you-were-totally-screwed/) (presumably in the sexual harassment case we suspect is coming any minute now).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Had I been asked by Mr. Weinstein to represent him, I would have declined, because I do not represent individuals accused of sex harassment.

Make no mistake, Allred isn’t denouncing her daughter or anything like that. [In a call with Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/gloria-allred-lisa-bloom-harvey-weinstein-statement), Allred was quick to point out that Bloom is a very good attorney and Weinstein is lucky to have her on board. Genuine and kind words, but the disappointment is still palpable.

And ultimately, mother knows best here.

Generally speaking, lawyers shouldn’t be judgmental about who they represent. The sanctity of the legal system rests on lawyers willing to defend anyone and everyone, no matter the accusations. But while that moral high horse is saddled perfectly for the attorney as lawyer, it doesn’t always suit the attorney as businessperson. Building a practice is all about finding that niche, and Lisa Bloom’s success is built on her reputation as an advocate for victims of sexual misconduct. Her clients seek her out, not just for her experience in this field, but because victims who already face an uphill battle with trust can feel confident that they have someone firmly in their corner. In fact, that’s why a mother with a practice focused on showing that consistency releases a statement like this about their daughter. Allred isn’t setting out to undermine her daughter, but her practice requires making clear that she won’t shy away from a harassment claim. Even if her family is on the other side.

That sort of credibility is not something that can easily survive a high-profile matter like this.

On the other hand, maybe Bloom has other interests as a businessperson:

Hmmmm.

There’s one more point Allred wanted to make sure everyone understood:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
While I would not represent Mr. Weinstein, I would consider representing anyone who accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment, even if it meant that my daughter was the opposing counsel.

Could we really see a mother-daughter showdown in a high-profile Hollywood harassment case? And isn’t this the plot of [Civil Action](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101590/)? That was technically a father-daughter situation, but gender flipping reboots are all the rage in Hollywood.

Maybe if this all goes down, Allred can find another studio to option that story.

But let’s go ahead and assume no one’s going the giant bear route. Because you hate your children.

You can try to make up for it with [a cool playhouse](http://amzn.to/28K9ZnD) (affiliate link).

Allen & Overy has decided its associates in the United States deserve to be compensated like the lawyers at their elite Biglaw peer firms. They [recently announced](https://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/blogs/linklaters-and-ao-join-magic-circle-peers-in-associate-salary-race-to-attract-us-talent/) they were getting on board with the new compensation scale made popular by a trio of Biglaw firms this summer, or as we’re calling it, the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale.

That means associates at the firm will be taking home $10,000 – $25,000 more, depending on class year.

Class of 2017: $190,000
Class of 2016: $200,000
Class of 2015: $220,000
Class of 2014: $255,000
Class of 2013: $280,000
Class of 2012: $305,000
Class of 2011: $325,000
Class of 2010: $340,000
Class of 2009+: $350,000

# Biglaw Is Handing Out Fidget Spinners And We're All Doomed
## Law students, check out your OCI swag.

Everyone erroneously thinks of OCI as a one-way transaction, an opportunity for nervous rising 2Ls to impress the gathering of elite law firms who deign to take meetings with these job hunters. But it’s really a two-way street. Biglaw knows the best and brightest are getting callbacks at all their competitors as well and they have to wow their prospects too.

One way to keep the firm’s name in the forefront of a law student’s mind is to put a cheap piece of plastic on their desk. It’s unclear if the “deal toy” industry really changes anyone’s mind — one would hope a law student isn’t making career decisions based on branded pens — but there’s something to be said for name recognition. I still remember that [Stroock & Stroock & Lavan](http://www.stroock.com) gave me a high-quality stress ball. The fact that, years later, I can identify specific swag with the firm that handed it out says something.

But the dark side of striving to hand out the most meaningful tchotchke is the phenomenon of dragging Biglaw brand names through the most despicable fads. As soon as a network morning show slaps together a “what are [insert dumb thing here], and why are kids obsessed with them?” story to fill time between a softball interview with Jay Sekulow and a feature piece on the best recipes for a summer funeral,[[1]](#f1) there’s a Biglaw firm ready to place an order for five crates of the crap branded to the hilt.

You just know there are some early 1990s Cadwalader pogs out there somewhere.

So it comes as no surprise to learn that fidget-spinners — the trend so stupid that Russia actually thinks it’s a [Western plot to undermine their society](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/18/russia-fidget-spinner-warning-opposition) — are the new hotness in Biglaw marketing:

Oh [Baker Botts](http://www.bakerbotts.com), why did you have to go and do this to the world? Also, when the firm logo is a big red box,[[2]](#f2) placing it on a red fidget spinner defeats the purpose. Get a white toy and have the logo appear as it’s meant to and… oh my God, I’m participating in this. I mean, why would you order red toys? Did you not have any choice?



Oh. Never mind, Baker Botts didn’t have any alternatives. It looks like the moguls at “Big Fidget Spinner” will get you a toy in any color you want as long as it’s red. Et tu, [Milbank](https://www.milbank.com/en/index.html)?

But this is America in 2017 and we must face it in all its depravity. OCI swag is how we encase in amber the horrible zeitgeist of a particular moment in time. Will any other firms offer fidget spinners? I hear there are pop sockets too. Jesus, what other emblems of American decline will besot OCI this year?

Hopefully some law student will swipe me a solid red “Make Jones Day Great Again” cap.

UPDATE: I’ve heard Cravath is doing it to. You know what that means: NY to… Fidget Spinner!

[ [1]](#reff1) Not mentioned: ongoing humanitarian crisis in some country that only the BBC seems to know about.

[ [1]](#reff1) Seriously, what’s up with that logo? It’s just a superscript red box. Like, “footnote… nondescript solid red box.” Did they hire the same design company who phoned in the decision to inexplicably change the USAToday logo to a solid blue dot?

# If Your Biglaw Firm 'Over-Hired' Associates, It May Be The Next To Conduct Stealth Layoffs

The firms that are seeing the biggest impact are the ones that over-hired last year and now that work has slowed. They hired so many attorneys that they don’t have the work to give them and so hours are extraordinarily low.

— [Summer Eberhard](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/summer-eberhard), a partner at Major Lindsey & Africa who recruits associates, commenting on the recent wave of stealth layoffs that have occurred at Biglaw firms (e.g., [Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/); [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-junior-associates-top-20-biglaw-firm-cooley/); and [Gunderson](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-firm-makes-2-rounds-stealth-layoffs-billable-work-disappears-gunderson/)), in an interview with [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-law-layoffs-look-to-correct-over-hiring-in-pandemic-boom). The list of Biglaw firms that have already conducted stealth layoffs or will do so in the future is expected to grow.

# Get Ready For THOUSANDS Of Biglaw Layoffs Due To COVID-19

While salary cuts shore up firms financially, they don’t address the fundamental problem: more lawyers than can be kept busy enough to grow professionally at the required pace. Thus, we should expect layoffs as people return to their offices. We should also anticipate churning of the equity partner ranks and another round of widening of equity partner comp ranges. …

[A]s an order of magnitude, if we repeated the same net 2008-10 contraction percent, and allowed for two new associate classes at smaller numbers than 2008-09, we’d be looking at a total of 20,000 departures—17,000 and 3,000 from the Am Law 100 and second hundred, respectively.

Simons](https://twitter.com/simonshugh?lang=en), formerly a senior partner and executive committee member at The Boston Consulting Group and chief operating officer and policy committee member at Ropes & Gray, offering a [sobering analysis](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/06/01/are-layoffs-coming-and-if-so-who-will-be-impacted/) of the layoffs to come due to the coronavirus pandemic that’s wreaked havoc upon the legal professional and Biglaw firms in particular.

Peter Thiel (Image by Dan Taylor)

I can’t say I agree with the politics of Peter Thiel. The PayPal co-founder and Facebook investor is a Donald Trump [supporter](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/22/peter-thiel-paypal-donald-trump-silicon-valley-libertarian) and is trying to create his own [Libertarian floating city](http://valleywag.gawker.com/peter-thiel-s-dream-of-a-lawless-utopia-floats-on-1368141049). But, man, he nails the Biglaw dilemma.

Thiel gave the commencement address at Hamilton College this weekend. As is typical of graduation remarks, he uses examples and lessons from his own life to impart some wisdom to the about-to-be-minted graduates. In particular, he discusses the lure of Biglaw — Thiel was an [associate at Sullivan & Cromwell](http://www.sfgate.com/living/article/Entrepreneur-Peter-Thiel-talks-Zero-to-One-5771228.php) — and even though it is a prestigious option, it does not mean it is the right option for you:

I did well enough in law school to be hired by a big New York law firm, but it turned out to be a very strange place. From the outside, everybody wanted to get in; and from the inside, everybody wanted to get out.

Thiel was in Biglaw in the early 90s, but little has changed since then. I suppose it is oddly comforting that some things, even if they are miserable things, never change.

When I left the firm, after seven months and three days, my coworkers were surprised. One of them told me that he hadn’t known it was possible to escape from Alcatraz. Now that might sound odd, because all you had to do to escape was walk through the front door and not come back. But people really did find it very hard to leave, because so much of their identity was wrapped up in having won the competitions to get there in the first place.

Seven months and three days in Biglaw. Damn, even [Elie Mystal outlasted](https://abovethelaw.com/author/elie-mystal/) him.

Thiel does a great job of outlining the emotional and psychological factors that make leaving Biglaw difficult, but there are also important financial factors at play for many in Biglaw. Most people graduate law school with debt, and sticking it out in Biglaw seems like the only realistic option to get out from that crushing burden.

Just as I was leaving the law firm, I got an interview for a Supreme Court clerkship. This is sort of the top prize you can get as a lawyer. It was the absolute last stage of the competition. But I lost. At the time I was totally devastated. It seemed just like the end of the world.

About a decade later, I ran into an old friend. Someone who had helped me prepare for the Supreme Court interview, whom I hadn’t seen in years. His first words to me were not, you know, “Hi Peter” or “How are you doing?” But rather, “So, aren’t you glad you didn’t get that clerkship?” Because if I hadn’t lost that last competition, we both knew that I never would have left the track laid down since middle school, I wouldn’t have moved to California and co-founded a startup, I wouldn’t have done anything new.

An important reminder that no matter how devastating a setback may seem at the time, it still possible to carve out a path that is even more rewarding.

Looking back at my ambition to become a lawyer, it looks less like a plan for the future and more like an alibi for the present. It was a way to explain to anyone who would ask—to my parents, to my peers, and most of all to myself—that there was no need to worry. I was perfectly on track. But it turned out in retrospect that my biggest problem was taking the track without thinking really hard about where it was going.

Excellent advice. Particularly for those thinking about going to law school, before you take out the loans and start down that path, make sure it is really where you want to go.

# Ex-Biglaw Partner Trades Litigation For Lashes
## You too can take Biglaw and shove it.

Ever want to just shove your Biglaw job and follow your heart’s desire? A former Kirkland & Ellis partner, Timothy Duffy, has done just that — leaving the drudgery of Biglaw for a life of entrepreneurship.

After more than 20 years at K&E, he got bitten by the business bug when he helped a friend out with the creation of CeresNexus LLC, a startup that simplifies buying food products from vendors. According to a [profile at Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2018/01/12/from-big-law-to-fake-lashes-ex-kirkland-partner-tries-hand-at-new-biz/), once the idea of leaving Biglaw took hold, it was tough to resist:

“As soon as you start thinking about doing something new it’s like, ‘Oh gee, well my normal job is kind of boring,’” he joked.

Duffy hasn’t totally abandoned the law; when he left Biglaw, he hung out his own shingle, and he continues to work on some matters for K&E clients. But he’s also a small business owner now. Duffy and his wife Bette Ann own an eyelash extension franchise called [Deka Lash](http://www.dekalash.com/locations/glenview).

Not that transitioning to the world of eyelash extensions was the most obvious career path for Duffy, but he knows a good opportunity when he sees it:

“Like most guys I had no idea you even did this or this was a thing,” said Timothy Duffy of his new enterprise in the Windy City suburb of Glenview, Illinois. “But when [my wife] told me she was going to a salon and spending about $500 a month on eyelashes and she couldn’t get an appointment because the place was so booked up, I thought, ‘Well, maybe there’s something to this.’”

The Duffys are opening a second location next month, and plans for two more locations are in the works.

Now that Duffy’s put Biglaw life behind him, he has some thoughts about so many that let themselves get trapped in a job they don’t really like:

“You have a lot of smart people putting a lot of effort into making their third and fourth million dollars, and if that’s what you want to do that’s fantastic, but I think a lot of people end up doing that even though that’s not really what they want to do,” said Duffy, adding that such pressure often has less to do with dollar figures than a feeling of not measuring up to colleagues. “And I really think it leads to good smart people [being] trapped by their own ambition in a way they never really expected.”

Remember only you can force yourself to continue at a job that makes you miserable. Eyelashes may not be your thing, but there’s something out there you’re bound to enjoy.

# Special Counsel Appointed To Probe Biden's Classified Documents Is Really Bad News For Trump
## Be careful what you wish for.

Republicans may have moved on to [huffing on gas stoves fumes all day](https://twitter.com/Jim_Jordan/status/1613617882004443138), but Merrick Garland has a long memory — well, at least long enough to remember [this week](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/maybe-the-biden-classified-docs-wont-become-the-next-but-her-emails-false-equivalency/) — and decided to act on the previous GOP outrage demanding [a special counsel to investigate Joe Biden’s mishandled classified documents](https://nypost.com/2023/01/11/gop-calls-on-garland-to-appoint-special-counsel-to-probe-biben/). After a furious news cycle complaining to right-wing outlets about the injustice that Donald Trump faces a special prosecutor and Joe Biden doesn’t, the Department of Justice went ahead and gave Republicans got exactly what they asked for.

Oops.

The Trump and Biden cases are the same… except for the volume of materials, the fact that Trump attorneys appear to have falsely represented to law enforcement that there were no more materials, and then ultimately refused to turn documents over after months of negotiations forcing the government to get a warrant. By contrast, Biden’s team appears to have found materials and just went ahead and informed law enforcement about it. But putting aside all of that the part that is the same is that political appointees in the DOJ are best handing off the matter to special counsel to avoid the appearance of impropriety.

Which has now happened.

Trump and friends botched this strategy from the beginning. Demanding a special counsel for the Biden issue was never going to convince the DOJ to just forget that they had to execute a warrant to get material they’d politely asked Trump to return for months.

Instead, they just made the Trump probe look less partisan. If Jack Smith finds a basis for criminal charges, he now has even more legitimacy to bring a case against Trump. Conservative voters will forever quibble over the false equivalency, but all the dwindling number of moderates and independents see if a Department of Justice willing to put a former Republican U.S. Attorney on Biden’s case.

Gibson Dunn partner [Robert Hur](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/hur-robert-k/), formerly the Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, will now look into Biden’s documents. He’ll probably conclude that Biden improperly handled the documents and recommend an administrative penalty of some kind, which is how these cases usually go when the target didn’t mislead investigators.

Take it from an expert in this area:

This should & will be investigated. This occurs commonly & usually results in administrative rather than criminal action. Trump & team would have fared exactly same way had he not delayed, obstructed & potentially lied abt existence of classified records at MAL.

Big difference. [https://t.co/PWaXPQI55F](https://t.co/PWaXPQI55F)

COVID-19 changed 2020 for everyone. It led to many unanticipated consequences for lawyers as thousands upon thousands of lawsuits have been filed related to the virus.

This post looks at a sample of decisions involving lawyers from the [2019 Am Law Top 10 firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/breaking-down-the-2020-am-law-100-rankings/) based on gross revenue’s participation in such lawsuits. To do this it focuses on the 110 published and unpublished state and federal civil law decisions involving these firms in Westlaw’s COVID-19 litigation set over a six-month period from June 23, 2020, to December 23rd, 2020.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The order of the firms based on gross revenues is: (1) Kirkland & Ellis, (2) Latham & Watkins, (3) DLA Piper, (4) Baker McKenzie, (5) Skadden, (6) Sidley Austin, (7) Morgan Lewis, (8) Hogan Lovells, (9) White & Case, and (10) Jones Day. The order of the firms by decision count in this area is:



Jones Day had lawyers in more of these cases than the other firms followed by Latham & Watkins and Kirkland & Ellis, with the range at a substantial 30 decisions. Another way to look at this is that, over this time period, Jones Day had attorneys involved in 850% more cases that went to written decisions than Baker McKenzie. 

The firms often focused their litigation in certain, mainly federal courts. The courts most frequented in these law firms include:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


The firms that litigated most frequently in particular courts include Latham & Watkins in SDNY, CDCA, and NDCA; Jones Day in EDMI; and Sidley in CDCA. The courts with the highest level of participation by these firms include SDNY, CDCA, and DMA. 

The litigation frequencies can also be visualized on a national scale: 



It is evident that most of this litigation transpires on the Eastern and Western seaboards with some additional involvement in the South and Midwest. Not surprisingly, the state with the most decisions at 55 is California, followed by New York with 34 decisions, and Massachusetts with 16 decisions. Michigan, Illinois, and D.C. are the other states/territories with over 10 decisions (each has 11).

# Former Biglaw Partner Challenges Conviction, Alleging Jury Misconduct
## Of course they want the verdict overturned.

Evan Greebel and Martin Shkreli

Former Katten Muchin Rosenman partner Evan Greebel is facing 20 years in prison after he was found guilty of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. So it really shouldn’t come as a shock that his lawyers are trying to get his conviction thrown out.

Greebel’s legal troubles arose from his representation of pharmaceutical company Retrophin and now-infamous pharma bro Martin Shkreli from 2012 to 2014. Greebel was convicted of assisting Shkreli in using Retrophin’s assets to pay investors in unrelated hedge funds run by Shkreli through the use of phony settlement and consulting agreements and fraudulently backdating agreements. Now Greebel’s attorneys allege that jury misconduct should void the conviction.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1013991) Law360, Greebel’s attorneys allege that a juror only voted to convict their client after he was threatened and ridiculed by other jurors:

Greebel’s attorneys now say the juror, Desmond Sankar, voted to convict Greebel in response to multiple threats from other jurors.

Jurors ridiculed Sankar, saying he could never be fair and vote to convict Greebel because Sankar is Catholic, the brief said.

Greebel’s legal team cited an apologetic text message sent to Sankar from another juror sent after the first full day of deliberations which read, “I do not feel good about what we the fellow jurors [p]ut you through … [I]t was not fair.”

Sankar now says that Greebel should not have been found guilty.

In addition to threatening Sankar, attorneys also say that the jurors openly discussed the case, contrary to the instructions from district court judge Kiyo Matsumoto:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Jurors also disregarded Judge Matsumoto’s daily instructions not to discuss the case, the brief said, with several jurors openly talking about their likely vote throughout the trial. According to the brief, at least three jurors apart from Sankar at various times expressed their belief in Greebel’s innocence.

In addition to the jury misconduct, defense attorney filings also seek an acquittal or a new trial due to insufficient evidence, erroneous legal rulings and a failure to turn over exculpatory evidence.

# Quinn Emanuel Adjusts Partner Compensation Due To Pandemic
## Unexpected news from a firm with top partner profits.

The coronavirus continues to wreak havoc upon the legal profession as we know it, and now one of the biggest names in Biglaw is making adjustments in response to the financial uncertainties that go hand in hand with market instability.

We’re told that Quinn Emanuel, which came in 25th place in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, with $1.25 billion in revenue in 2019, will be postponing partner distributions that were originally scheduled for April until July. On top of that, the firm has revised the size of partner draws for April, May, and June. When it comes to profits per equity partner, Quinn Emanuel is ranked No. 5 in the Am Law 100, with each partner raking in $4.5 million. “We’re focused on building up our cash reserves, given who knows what the future holds,” said John Quinn, the firm’s founder.

The American Lawyer [has additional details](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/05/11/guarding-cash-quinn-emanuel-hits-pause-on-partner-distributions-and-rejiggers-draws/) on the scope of the pay adjustments:

One source familiar with the changes said that all partners would receive draws of $30,000 per month starting in June. Quinn would not comment on the specific size of the draws, but emphasized that reductions were not universal.

“Some people are getting less than before, while some are getting more,” he said. “It’s not true that all are getting reduced.” …

Quinn emphasized that the changes were not motivated by financial distress, saying that the temporary decreases applied primarily to more senior, highly paid partners. He added that the firm has not laid off or furloughed any employees and does not intend to.

Quinn says his firm has been “gratified” because its financial performance has been strong through the pandemic thus far. “It’s like the whole economy went off the cliff,” he said. “We didn’t know what this was going to mean for us.” It’s likely Quinn Emanuel will continue to see success as the COVID crisis rages on.

Dozen of Biglaw leaders have come together to condemn the latest funding plan of New York Governor Kathy Hochul that would divert $100 million from the New York Interest on Lawyer Account Fund (IOLA). That money has historically been used to fund legal aid for low-income New Yorkers, and Hochul’s plan would move the money to the state’s general fund.

Leaders from a wide swath of Biglaw firms including Paul Weiss, Cravath, Hogan Lovells, Cleary, Cooley, Debevoise, Sidley, Skadden, and Sullivan & Cromwell wrote that the move is “misguided” and “an existential threat” to essential legal services.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We are deeply concerned that this unprecedented diversion of funds would impose lasting harm on low-income New Yorkers by taking money from legal aid organizations, would severely undermine the stability of a critical source of financial support for legal services and would violate the statute that created IOLA.”

As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1797111) Law360, the funds collected through IOLA are used to fund legal services:

The state’s IOLA program requires attorneys to maintain special interest-bearing trust accounts for “qualified funds,” or funds that the attorney determines to be too small or held for too short a time to generate net interest, according to the IOLA website. Those funds are kept together in an IOLA account, and the interest from the account goes to legal aid as well as improvements in the “administration of justice” in the state, according to the program’s description.

Biglaw isn’t the only segment of the legal profession miffed at this plan.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The New York City Bar Association wrote their own letter about the plan, “Food security, shelter, jobs, health care and other life necessities would be at risk if these non-taxpayer, IOLA funds were to be diverted.”

In another letter, social service agencies including Access to Justice Brooklyn, Community Service Society of New York, and the City Bar Justice Center, opposed Hochul’s plan:

“Ethics opinions approving attorney use of IOLA accounts were expressly predicated on the IOLA Fund enhancing civil legal services to low-income New Yorkers,” they said. “Therefore, diversion of any IOLA interest to the General Fund could jeopardize the legal profession’s ethical basis for participating in the IOLA Fund.”

Even the IOLA Board of Trustees came out against the plan, urging the fund not be diverted, despite the state’s budget problems. “In the 40 years of IOLA’s existence, New York state has faced many crises including housing, education, financial and a global pandemic,” the board said. “Despite these challenges, IOLA’s funds cannot and should not be diverted to the general fund.”

# When Biglaw Firms Set 90-Day Performance Targets, Stealth Layoffs Can't Be Far Behind

When a law firm wants to lay off a bunch of attorneys but doesn’t want to send a sign of weakness to clients and peer firms, it opts for a stealth layoff. With a stealth layoff, the firm pins the blame on the associates for vague “performance issues.”

It leaves associates feeling guilty over a financial move entirely out of their control. If performed appropriately stealthily, it isolates embarrassed associates from discovering through their colleagues that they aren’t alone.

Stealth layoffs are bad. And that’s why, no matter how unpleasant layoffs are, we [give proper credit](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) to firms willing to be straightforward and forthright when they part with folks.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The only challenge with a stealth layoff is building a plausible record of performance issues. When top-billing associates with glowing reviews get sideswiped by a “performance-based termination,” they tend to blow the whistle on the whole ruse.

But what if the firm invents a series of impossible benchmarks for associates to meet within an incredibly short timeframe? Yes… yes, that just might work!

According to an unconfirmed tip, one Biglaw firm is using the annual review process to implement three-month “performance improvement plans” for a number of associates with “zero notice of any performance issues the prior year.” While there’s nothing necessarily wrong about formalized professional development plans, setting a 90-day deadline to meet previously unannounced targets reads as a classic effort to set up attorneys to fail.

Given that the firm involved has a notorious history of stealth layoffs whenever the economy — or specifically, the tech sector of the economy — suffers the slightest economic hiccup, it’s hard to see this as a good faith attorney training.

[](https://bit.ly/3OWURp9)Lawyers have been marketing their practices in the same way, for a long time. 

Talk to other lawyers, get referrals. Rinse and repeat. 

Of course, there’s a whole host of other marketing options accessible to you, if you choose to engage them.

And, it turns out that younger lawyers, especially millennials, are taking a web-first approach to marketing.

So we brought on a millennial lawyer to talk about her marketing strategy. 

In this episode of the Non-Eventcast, we speak with Giselle Rodriguez of the Law Office of Giselle M. Rodriguez in Boston, to school you on the new school.

We also addressed how Giselle repurposes her TikTok content for other platforms, like Instagram and Facebook (21:03, 23:34, 24:37). Finally, Giselle talks all about her movie acting career — yes, that’s right: Giselle is kind of a big deal (26:56).  Maybe that’s why she’s so good at using social media.

# West Coast Biglaw Firms Won't Be Mandating Office Attendance Any Time Soon
## California wins when it comes to hybrid work policies for associates.

Much to many lawyers’ chagrin, Wall Street firms are mandating office attendance left and right, with a handful even demanding that associates return to the office four days each week. But what’s going on at firms on the other side of the country? Are their attendance policies as stereotypically laid back and relaxed as West Coast life is made out to be? Of course, bro.

A number of Biglaw firms in California and other West Coast locales are allowing their attorneys to make their own decisions about when to come to the office, and it’s working out just fine for them. At some top firms, there are no attendance mandates to be had. Take, for example, Wilson Sonsini’s approach. [The Recorder](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2023/07/19/we-wont-mandate-west-coast-law-firms-arent-following-wall-street-back-to-the-office/) has the details:

“We won’t change our approach or mandate X number of days in the office for a variety of reasons, including that we don’t want to police attendance,” said Doug Clark, managing partner of Wilson Sonsini.

Instead of an across-the-board policy, practices and other small groups choose in-office days and the frequency of those days. “We like the fact that our teams can discuss and decide what works for them,” Clark said.

“If I had one wish, it’d be that I was in the office more and others were too,” he added. “But I think that’ll happen more. There are benefits to coming in and there are benefits to flexibility for people’s personal and professional lives. We’ll continue to try to strike a balance between the two.”

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
DLA Piper is following a similar plan, having put into place a “high-performance flexibility” initiative without any hard attendance requirements. It’s working well because it has allowed attorneys to create their own plans for remote versus in-office work — and it’s helping the firm to recruit and retain talent, too. “We recognize one size does not fit all,” global chair Frank Ryan told [The Recorder](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2023/07/19/we-wont-mandate-west-coast-law-firms-arent-following-wall-street-back-to-the-office/). “We want to provide our people with a wide range of work choices, as well as the structure and consistency that ensures we’re working together seamlessly at the benefit of our clients.”

Other West Coast firms are mandating attendance, but they’re not policing who’s in the office and when. That’s what’s happening at California midsize firm Michelman & Robinson, which currently mandates three days a week in the office. The firm plans to move up to four office days in September, with an eye on five office days come January.

[T]he firm is attempting to coax attorneys back to the office through the fear of missing out, or FOMO, rather than any sort of punitive measures, which [chairman and co-founder Sanford Michelman] said would be out of line with the firm’s culture.

“I don’t believe in negative incentives,” he said. “We’re not taking attendance. We’re not treating people like they’re in high school, saying you owe us a day for missing a day. That’s like a detention. Culturally, it’ll get worse if you treat people like widgets.”

On the flip side of the coin, Am Law 200 firm Hanson Bridgett doesn’t have any attendance requirements at all under its “agile workforce” model. “Our perspective on return to work is a perspective about showing up for each other,” Kristina Lawson, the firm’s managing partner, told [The Recorder](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2023/07/19/we-wont-mandate-west-coast-law-firms-arent-following-wall-street-back-to-the-office/). “We aren’t interested in a mandate. It’s not something that we believe is necessary or aligns with our values or culture.”

# Simpson Thacher Enters The 2021 Special Bonus Wars Scene

Biglaw special bonuses keep rolling on in, and it’s a big bash with all of the usual suspects in attendance. [Willkie](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) got the party started, and when [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) arrived, the bass dropped, and everyone else came rushing in to celebrate. Thus far, six firms have matched the prevailing special bonus scale. Who’s up next to make it rain on associates?

It’s Simpson Thacher, and the firm is offering up the following bonuses (full memo on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/simpson-thacher-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Simpson giveth with one hand and taketh away with the other. What do we mean by that? Payments for associates will be made on June 30 and September 30, on a global basis. Yay! Counsel and senior counsel won’t see any extra bonus cash until year’s end, on a case-by-case basis. Ouch. Hopefully the firm will be just as generous with its counsel as its associates.

P.S. In case you’re wondering where Cravath’s special bonus money is… so are we. Is the prestigious firm planning to somehow come over the top? We suppose we’ll have to wait and see, but we feel like a match is imminent.

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/simpson-thacher-special-bonus-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Simpson Thacher.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# In the Market For Cannabis Counsel? Don’t Pay Your Lawyers To Learn On The Job!
## There is a big difference between proclaiming expertise in an emerging practice area and actually delivering a top-flight offering.

Demand for high-end legal services is booming this year, and law firms are [competing fiercely](https://laterallink.com/why-use-a-recruiter-in-a-hot-lateral-market/) for talent across many practice areas. Growth has been particularly strong in some niche practices that barely existed a decade ago, such as cannabis and blockchain. For law firms, the business case for establishing and promoting groups in these emerging fields is becoming ever more compelling. The demand is there, so why not try to get a piece of it?

But there is a big difference between proclaiming expertise in an emerging practice area and actually delivering a top-flight offering. The supply of practitioners with a genuine track record in an emerging field is relatively thin by definition. So from a client’s perspective, it is important to be a skeptical consumer.

Let’s take cannabis as an example. If you found yourself in need of counsel to assist with a cannabis-related matter, you might think the [Chambers and Partners ranking](https://chambers.com/legal-rankings/cannabis-law-usa-nationwide-5:2815:12788:1) of nationwide cannabis practices would be a natural place to start. In Band 1, you’ll find three diversified Am Law 100 firms (Akerman, Duane Morris, Fox Rothschild) and a boutique specialized in cannabis (Vicente Sederberg). So is the right answer to just hire one of those Band 1 firms?

Possibly — but not necessarily. You’ll first want to be clear about the nature of the task and how it aligns with the service offerings of different firms. Cannabis is an especially complicated area for two basic reasons. First, and most obviously, marijuana remains a [Schedule I drug](https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling) at the Federal level. Many elite law firms therefore remain cautious about serving cannabis clients, especially companies whose operations entail direct handling of the product (sometimes called “leaf-touching” entities).

Second, to the extent cannabis cultivation and distribution has been legalized by State legislatures, each market exists wholly within the individual State: there is no legal interstate commerce in cannabis products. This means the regulatory dimension of the industry is deeply fragmented. To the extent counsel may have regulatory experience in one State, the legal knowledge and regulatory relationships will not translate neatly to another jurisdiction.

Given that complexity, it is important to be savvy about what you actually need and whether a firm is properly equipped to provide it. For one thing, the fact that a legal task is connected to a cannabis company doesn’t by itself make the matter distinctive. Much of the legal work in the cannabis field entails bread and butter transactional services that look broadly similar to transactional work in any other industry. For example, if you want to set up a fund to invest in the cannabis space, you should probably hire a highly experienced funds counsel, rather than a lawyer who claims particular expertise in cannabis. If you can find both, that’s great, but in general, industry knowledge is going to matter less than functional experience.

Conversely, if you need advice about cannabis regulatory matters, both industry and geographic experience will be critical. Be careful about hiring a nationwide firm in this situation. A credible locally-based provider who knows the regulators in the relevant State may well be a better choice than a firm that appears on the Chambers ranking.

As a general rule in emerging practice areas, there is a real temptation to rebrand some current partners as experts in the new field. The firm will then try to convince clients to send relevant matters its way, enabling the firm’s lawyers to learn on the fly by working on those initial matters. Essentially, fake it until you make it. One Am Law 100 firm currently has a cannabis group led by a litigation associate. In fields like cannabis or blockchain, you’ll want to be extra skeptical of claims of expertise, to ensure that you aren’t subsidizing the development of lawyers whose depth in the subject matter is questionable. Know what you need, and don’t pay your counsel to learn on the job.

# Biglaw Firms Are Loading Up Their C-Suites With New Talent

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

There is this ongoing shift in law firms really trying to bring in the business people who will perpetuate the firms forward from a strategy perspective and a financial perspective. Those are the two areas we’re seeing the most investment.

— Kristin Stark, a principal at Fairfax Associates, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/01/16/kirkland-cooley-crowell-bring-real-impact-c-suite-leaders-to-start-the-year/) concerning those who are being added to the C-suite at Biglaw firms across the country. Stark continued, adding that these moves are happening at the beginning of the year because of the “real impact that C-leaders have on the firm’s ability to have a successful and seamless financial year-end and close.”
