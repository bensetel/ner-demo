# Bonus Season Has Started, But Where Are The Bonuses? Come On, Cravath!

Baker McKenzie decided to kick off the 2020 bonus season bright and early on Wednesday morning, announcing the [$15K to $100K scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) that we’ve seen for years now (while promising to match any increases in the market, should they occur). Thus far, the firm’s announcement has been more or less ignored.

Before you start wondering what the other firms could possibly be waiting for before making their matches, you should know that we’ve seen this before.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Last year, [Milbank made the first move](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/) when it came to announcing year-end bonuses, and for five days, partners on Biglaw executive committees sat twiddling their thumbs until [Cravath came forward](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/) to announce that it was matching the Milbank bonus scale. Only then did matches occur — and at a rapid pace, at that.

Cravath’s seal of approval may be what’s needed here, but let’s face it: we’re dealing with a pandemic and there are already different tiers of compensation across Biglaw.

“This year we see much more of a fragmented system with different firms doing different things,” said Nathan Peart, managing director of Major, Lindsey & Africa’s associate practice group, in an interview with [Am Law](https://www.law.com/2020/11/12/baker-mckenzie-bonuses-met-with-crickets-but-likely-not-for-long/). If you recall, while some firms adopted special fall bonuses on the [Davis Polk scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/), others decided either to commit to matching them when year-end bonus time came around or forgo them entirely.

Peart adds that the rest of the market could also be waiting for historical bonus leaders like Cravath or Milbank to make a move before jumping into the fray—a possibility Baker McKenzie seems to have hedged for, by telling its associates that the firm will match any increase to the scale.

“The market does look to the likes of Cravath and Milbank to make that market leap,” Peart said. “I don’t think Baker wants to set a figure and not have any flexibility if the market goes higher. I think it was prudent to do that … It makes sense to say ‘we’re going to match don’t worry about that.’ The psychology is very important internally for the firm.”

It looks like we’re going to have to wait impatiently for Cravath to make its move on bonuses, but for the time being, at least associates know what the bottom of the 2020 bonus market looks like. It’s just a matter of when your firm will match or beat it.

# Partners Seem Worried About How Biglaw Behemoth A&O Shearman Will Operate
## There's growing anxiety over who will take the lead at the newly merged firm that's poised to be the third largest in the world.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

If I was an A&O partner in the U.S., would I be worried? Yes.

A&O should try and keep the best Shearman partners within the integrated firm. If A&O keeps on taking the lead in the U.S., there is a risk of further Shearman partners leaving, and the merger not being successful.

— A former A&O partner, in anonymous comments given to the [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/02/08/there-is-concern-ao-shearman-insiders-on-initial-hurdles-facing-firm-405-136109/) on what could possibly go wrong for A&O Shearman after the [newly merged](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/ao-shearman-merger-approved-poised-to-become-third-largest-firm-in-the-world/) firm’s official launch date in May, from who will lead the firm to how it will operate in the U.S. and across the globe. “In the U.S., there is concern over how the Shearman culture fits in with what we’re doing,” said another lawyer with knowledge of A&O. “It seems impossible that [Shearman partners] won’t be in the driving seat given how many of them there are.”

# Associates Fear Complex Biglaw Bonus Criteria Will Leave Them In The Dust
## How should associates feel about discretionary bonuses?

There are lots of benefits to lockstep bonuses, or at least bonuses that are triggered when hitting objective metrics like hours. Associates know what is expected of them, there is a greater sense of congeniality amongst lawyers who aren’t backbiting in order to secure themselves more money, and your bonus system doesn’t wind up featured on Above the Law.

On Friday, in an [article about bonus season](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/so-who-is-pissed-about-their-bonuses/), we quoted a current associate at Morgan Lewis who was pissed about a bonus allocation system that left large amounts of money up to discretionary factors (including “firm citizenship” and timekeeping), such that even attorneys that made their hours might not see the full market bonus. But as with all things discretionary, not everyone has the same take. We heard from another tipster who feels certain that the discretionary elements to bonus allocation are not undercover cost cutting measures and that, come bonus time, things will go their way:

Whoever told you that ML “intends to cut bonuses” had an extremely incorrect take away from that presentation.  First off, ML should be applauded for its transparency in letting associates know what to expect and how the process is decided.  I can tell you from personal experience that ML always goes above and beyond in taking care of its associates, and they made clear they intend to continue to do so.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But that isn’t to say the concerns over the discretionary elements of the bonus payday aren’t justified. Even though Morgan Lewis went into PR triage mode, assuring worried associates the Biglaw Grinch would not be taking away their bonuses, they also didn’t back down from the discretionary factors:

Just a quick update here: we got a panicked voicemail Friday afternoon after the ATL Morgan Lewis [bonus story](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/so-who-is-pissed-about-their-bonuses/) was published. 

The head of “talent management” had been getting calls/emails from associates and she wanted to assure us that the allegations in the ATL story were patently false and that Morgan Lewis pays competitive bonuses, it’s just that bonuses are only paid to associates that satisfy 5 categories of evaluation from firm management (making your hours is just one of the 5, you must also pass muster for quality of work, “firm citizenship”, time keeping etc.).  But not to worry, if you make your hours but miss the mark in one of those other categories, the firm is still generous enough to give you a bonus, they’re just going to reduce it by 25-75% of the market rate. 

So, put another way, “Morgan Lewis has made clear that they intend to cut bonuses for associates that made their hours (2000) by anywhere from 25 to 75% based on subjective factors in the discretion of firm/practice group management”, or exactly what you published on Friday.

So that’s what the associates on the ground are saying. Yes, opinion varies, probably depending on how confident they feel about the discretionary factors in their bonus. Perhaps when payday comes folks will see that their worries were unfounded, but until then the speculation will run wild.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Time’s Up For Using Arbitration To Squash Sexual Harassment Claims
## When organizations are using forced-arbitration provisions as a sword instead of a shield to cut civil rights protections, then its peers and employees should call bullsh*t.

On Monday, our own Staci Zaretsky [reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-firm-tries-to-force-summer-associates-to-arbitrate-sexual-harassment-claims/?rf=1) on how Munger Tolles & Olson (MTO) was “trying to get its incoming summer associates to sign mandatory arbitration agreements — agreements that would have required them to arbitrate all employment-related claims, including sexual harassment claims.”

As Zaretsky noted, the day before, MTO had already issued a public statement via Twitter stating:

Munger Tolles & Olson is committed to the highest standards of conduct. In this case, we were wrong, and we are fixing it. We will no longer require any employees, including summer associates, to sign any mandatory arbitration agreements.

I certainly applaud MTO for recognizing the issue, accepting responsibility, and taking actions to course correct.

By Tuesday, Zaretsky reported that the first Biglaw firm, Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe, would voluntarily — as opposed to feeling the pressure of a social media sh*tstorm — no longer require any of its employees, including associates, to sign mandatory arbitration agreements. “Orrick has decided that it’s time for us to make a change,” the firm said in a statement given to Above the Law.

Is Orrick a harbinger of firms and organizations no longer using arbitration as a sword to cut down sexual harassment claims?

Earlier this year, I had the [opportunity to speak](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/the-trump-administration-seeks-to-rip-the-heart-out-of-labor-and-employment-law/) with Michael Rubin, a partner at Altshuler Berzon LLP, and Ceilidh Gao, a National Employment Law Project (NELP) attorney, about a peculiar case that pits the Justice Department directly against the National Relations Labor Board (NLRB).

In this case, SCOTUS is asked to determine: [whether workplace arbitration agreements that ban class actions violate federal labor laws](http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/09/argument-preview-reconciling-class-waivers-national-labor-relations-act/). Between 2012 and 2014, the use of class and collective actions bans in forced arbitration provisions more than doubled, from 16% to 43%. For better or worse, it is becoming crystal clear that organizations are jumping on the arbitration bandwagon and employees are being forced to go along for the ride.

A few years ago, I asked Steven Skulnik, Senior Legal Editor of Arbitration at Thomson Reuters Practical Law: How do you see international and domestic arbitration and mediation evolving over the next decade?

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
He gave quite the [prescient response](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/tips-from-steven-skulnik-on-how-culture-affects-international-and-domestic-arbitration-and-mediation/):

There are certainly headwinds from the courts, regulators and politicians pointing away from arbitration. Arbitration practitioners have a duty to explain the dispute resolution process in the face of misinformation in the media.

While I do think there can be quite a bit of misunderstanding when it comes to the arbitration process, I also believe current business-as-usual arbitration processes are ripe for abuse. When organizations are using forced-arbitration provisions as a sword instead of a shield to cut civil rights protections, then its peers and employees should call bullsh*t.

Any argument for economic efficiency of arbitration procedures or provisions that force non-disclosure of (or otherwise silence) [Title VII claims](https://www.justice.gov/crt/overview-employment-litigation) or ban class actions is greatly outweighed by the [radical tilt in the landscape against employees](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/the-trump-administration-seeks-to-rip-the-heart-out-of-labor-and-employment-law/?rf=1).

This week, I attended a fantastic labor and employment presentation titled, “What’s hot in employment and labor law for 2018,” hosted by Norton Rose Fulbright attorneys Mario A. Barrera, James Hughes, and Kelly Klingseisen.

Near the end of their presentation, they went over the history of the [#MeToo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too_movement) and [Time’s Up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time's_Up_(movement)) movements and revealed some [very interesting thoughts](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/02/21/uttt-poll-texans-divided-metoo-movement-which-groups-face-most-discrim/) on these grassroots campaigns. There was a general consensus in the room that law firms and other organizations should not be forcing their employees to sign mandatory arbitration agreements that require them to arbitrate Title VII claims, including sexual harassment claims.

This week, Munger Tolles & Olson and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe put their money where their mouth is. Will other law firms follow suit?

# Are More Biglaw Layoffs Looming On The Horizon?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

We would expect to see some more adjustments if the demand picture doesn’t pick up. And unfortunately, we don’t see it picking up.

— Owen Burman, managing director for the Wells Fargo Legal Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/05/02/big-law-surprisingly-strong-so-far-in-2023-but-more-cuts-could-be-on-the-way/) on the likelihood of more layoffs being conducted among Am Law 100 firms in 2023. Wells Fargo is projecting a recession to begin in the second half of the year, which does not bode well for Biglaw. “With the first quarter ending with a mild credit scare and increasing concern about economic growth, we are not surprised by recent press reports of headcount rationalization and postponement of associate starting dates,” the group noted in its most recent report. “While many announcements are among firms that hired most aggressively, other firms may follow suit if the transactional environment fails to improve. In the absence of demand growth, we expect firms to be vigilant on expense management, seeking operational efficiencies to offset required investments for in-person meetings and infrastructure improvements.”

# Flash Poll: Your Firm's Clout In The Cloud
## If you weren’t using cloud-based solutions before the pandemic, you probably are now. How's it going?

The concept of “the cloud” is often misunderstood — even though it’s a term that we use all the time.

Confusing matters even more, cloud computing has evolved significantly in the last two years in response to work-from-home and other needs. 

With organizations using cloud-based solutions for legal work more than they ever have before, now is the time to understand exactly what cloud computing is, how it’s helping legal practice, and how to select the right cloud vendor and solutions to meet the individual needs of your practice.

To help lawyers understand the current state of cloud computing in the legal industry, PLI is offering a one-day program, [Cloud Computing 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/cloud-computing?t=live), where industry experts will explain the ins and outs of relying on the cloud in modern legal practice.

Among other things, they’ll cover the business realities surrounding cloud computing, what to look for when entering into a cloud computing contract, important privacy and security considerations in cloud computing, and the ethical implications of using cloud-based tools in legal practice.

As always, [visit Practising Law Institute](https://www.pli.edu/) for more.

# If A Biglaw Firm Falls In The Woods And No One Issues A Press Release About Its Lack Of Diversity...
## This is an industry-wide problem... and it's time to shine the spotlight on the folks keeping quiet about it.

Outlets like Above the Law don’t report on every Biglaw firm’s new partnership class. Usually, it’s a relatively mundane collection of rising stars that haven’t really made a name for themselves outside the four walls of their well-appointed offices. Beyond allowing everyone to keep tabs on their least favorite gunners, new partnership announcements rarely move the needle. Unfortunately, when it comes to partnership promotions, no news is usually good news.

And that’s exactly why firms with something to hide can sometimes slip one past the media by keeping their mouths shut. Like one firm downtown that hasn’t made any announcement of its new partners even though the firm historically puts out a press release like clockwork at the top of the new year. Last year’s installment — [now conspicuously absent from the Internet](https://www.sullcrom.com/introducing-sullivan-cromwell-eight-newest-partners-2018) — began “S&C has elected eight partners to the partnership effective January 1, 2018.”

We received a tip about S&C’s lack of public announcement way back on January 2. At the time, we hoped it was premature. A month and a half later, it’s clear that it wasn’t.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I don’t know if Sullivan & Cromwell elected a markedly non-diverse class of new partners. The fact of the matter is no one knows because the firm didn’t trumpet its new class as it has in years past. Even though we could likely reverse engineer this, that’s also not the point — the firm decided against drawing attention to its new partner class for the first time in a long time and given the negative press — some of it starting here — that Paul Weiss received over its partnership class, one has to wonder if the strategic decision was “keep quiet and hope no one notices.”

The uproar around the [incoming partnership class at Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/paul-weiss-press-release-captures-everything-broken-about-biglaw-in-one-image/) highlighted this “market of ideas” failure in the media business — this reliance on transparency as a springboard to criticism that incentivizes others to recede into opacity. When Paul Weiss announced an almost entirely white male incoming class with a lone white woman to round out the class, the image the firm released — more so even than the promotions themselves — captured the diversity problem in Biglaw because someone along the way never thought an image like that could be anything but ordinary.

But precisely because this was Paul Weiss, the firm addressed the matter swiftly and set aside an opportunity to discuss what happened with the whole firm and have already taken steps to [improve diversity through the lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/paul-weiss-launches-supreme-court-practice-as-press-spotlight-returns-to-partnership-diversity/).

While improving diversity in the legal profession is a task every firm needs to commit to with far more vigor, the attention heaped upon Paul Weiss always seemed a bit disproportionate. While the image captured the broad struggle across Biglaw, there are certainly firms doing far less to address improve diversity both firmwide and in particular in senior leadership positions. To some extent, Paul Weiss bore the brunt of an industry crisis because it happened to offer transparency. There’s not an easy way to see that, for example, Cravath has no black partners. Therefore Paul Weiss’s name gets associated with diversity struggles that it addresses better than many of its peer firms while those firms avoid the spotlight.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This is an industry-wide problem and one that all firms need to redouble their efforts upon. Whenever we report on diversity in firms — both the successes and the failures — those of us covering the issue need to underscore for the readers that we’re only reporting on a slice of a wider crisis and that no success can be celebrated or failure lamented without grasping how it fits into the overarching diversity landscape.

Trees still make a sound when they fall no matter how cagey your press strategy.

# The Reason Why Milbank Raised Associate Salaries
## Associates shouldn't have to wait 10 years for a raise.

Two years have now gone by, and there is cost-of-living increases and inflation. We want to signal to the market that we do want the best, and we’re willing to pay for the best, and we think after two years, an additional increase is appropriate.

— Milbank chairman Scott Edelman, [in an interview with Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/04/milbank-boosts-associate-salaries-with-190k-starting-pay/) explaining why the firm [raised associate salaries across the board.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) Associates will receive raises between $10,000 and $15,000, depending on seniority. Two years ago, [Cravath started a salary war](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) when the firm moved the Biglaw market to $180,000 for first-year associates after a nearly 10-year period of stagnation.

# Biglaw Firm Beats Cravath Scale With Special Bonuses
## Beating the market once again.

Cravath may have [set the standard](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/) but Cahill, Gordon & Reindel is coming over the top. In addition to the standard, end of the year bonuses — which mirror the standard set by CSM — associates in good standing are getting special bonuses from $10,000 to $40,000 depending on class year as follows:



The bonuses will be paid in January — the 6th for the special bonus, and the end of January for the end of year bonus. Tipsters report they are “pretty excited” about the news, and with paydays this big, who can blame them?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Cahill has a history of beating the market: in the past they’ve offered special bonuses in the [summer](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/associate-bonus-watch-biglaw-summer-bonuses/?rf=1) and at the [end of the year](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-cahill-gordon-beats-the-market-once-again/) so the associates could share in the bounty. But [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-a-former-bonus-leader-takes-a-tumble/) Cahill met the going market rate, but did no more. While at plenty of firms meeting the market standard would be cause for cheer, it was met with concern at Cahill. It’s good to see times are good again at 80 Pine Street and the recent associate raises didn’t trade off with bonuses.

So how’s all this extra money treating you Cahill people? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Major Biglaw Firm Matches The 2022 Baker/Cravath Bonus Scale
## It's bonus time at this leading law firm!

Cravath finally offered its [seal of approval](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cravath-bonuses-22/) on the [Baker McKenzie bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-bonus-season-begins/) last night, with some notable dissimilarities — the compensation leader included first-years while excluding eighth-years from its own scale. And so, Cravath has now officially kicked off Biglaw’s bonus season, while curiously offering other firms the option to leave their eldest associates out of the annual cash grab. (But do note, of course, that not being included in the lockstep bonus chart leaves room for sometimes great, sometimes not-so great individualized bonuses.) Now, another elite law firm has jumped to match the market rate as quickly as possible.

Which firm is the first to “match” Cravath’s Biglaw bonus scale?

McDermott Will & Emery — a firm that brought in $1,665,221,000 gross revenue in 2021 — is the first firm to hop on the Cravath bonus bandwagon. This is a blended Baker/Cravath bonus, in that the firm is handing out money to both first- and eighth-years at the firm. Bonuses at the firm will be paid to all associates in good standing on December 29, 2022. There’s just one teeny caveat: to be eligible for a bonus, an associate must have joined the firm prior to August 1, 2022.

Here’s the bonus scale, in case you’ve forgotten what it looks like:

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015+: $115,000
It’s worth noting that McDermott Will is paying significantly above these amounts for those who went “above and beyond.” Here’s an excerpt from the firm’s memo (available in full on the next page):

We are always committed to paying at—and above—the Cravath scale for those who meet our reasonable threshold. As you know, we do not use a lockstep model and we choose to use an individual merit-based system endorsed by our Associates’ Committee and Firm leadership. This approach provides for substantial incremental bonuses for those who go above and beyond in terms of hours expectations and performance. In fact, about 65% of our Associates will earn above the Cravath scale.

Congratulations to all MWE associates on the generous bonuses!

(Does this mean that associates’ hopes for another firm to step in and raise the bonus scale higher will be dashed? That’s uncertain, but we’ll be watching.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Guilty Of Multitasking
## Ah, the sweet, sweet sound that is the siren's song we all call multitasking.

In our post-pandemic, virtual, or hybrid work environment, it is super-tempting to multitask during a meeting or conference call with a lot of attendees, especially if you’re not critical to the event. Of course, if you’re not critical, I want to ask you why you’re there in the first place … but I also understand that some meetings are unavoidable, and the likely answer is that you were invited.

I am the first to admit that multitasking is a siren’s call that is extremely difficult for me to resist. There’s some kind of endorphin kick I get from being able to maximize my time despite all the studies out there that say multitasking is not actually productive. (But why does it feel so good?!?)

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Now, I am not so bold as to respond to substantive emails — that’s a rookie move where you are likely to make typos and mistakes, not a good look for a legal professional. But I am the first to admit that I might skim and prioritize my inbox, organize my OneNote, or skim my LinkedIn if I have determined that whatever meeting I’m in doesn’t pertain to me. I have also been known to water my plants, transfer the laundry from washer to dryer, or get on the treadmill to get a few more steps in — all on mute, of course.

If you’re like me and can’t help it, here are a few tips that I’ve picked up.

Exercise Good Judgment And Choose Wisely

Before multitasking, be aware of your audience and the topic of the meeting and be sure that you’re really not critical. Professional reputation and branding is important so you wouldn’t want to risk appearing absent around your client or your leadership when you’re supposed to be engaged and responsive.

Gotta Be Listening … Some

You do need to stay engaged enough to respond if you get called on. This is why I wouldn’t recommend that your second task is something that requires focus. You do not want to risk zoning out and missing the question posed to you during the call while you were in deep analysis of a complex legal issue for another client.

Disclosure Can Be Your Friend

In moments of need, such as having a sick baby at home or while in transit during kid pickup or just at the airport, where I have to join a call because of its urgency or importance, I like to disclose my unique situation from the beginning. Sometimes clients can’t find any time on my calendar so I will necessarily offer up “after hours,” but fully disclosing that I’ll have to start dinner or simultaneously manage the kids (aka give them a screen) until my spouse (who has a long commute) gets home. I have never asked for direct feedback, but my hope is that my clients or leadership appreciate me doing my best to show up for their needs and appreciate the honesty.

No need to worry about merging anymore!

After 147 years of service, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan will soon join the great law firm in the sky. And though the firm may die, the partners live on. And the great Macklemore once said, one firms’s partner run is another firm’s come-up. With the way that these firms have been gobbling up Stroock’s talent, it looks like Thanksgiving came early. From [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/demise-147-year-old-stroock-is-boon-law-firm-rivals-2023-11-13/):

Crowell & Moring, Hogan Lovells, Steptoe & Johnson, Squire Patton Boggs and Thompson Coburn are among the law firms that have so far hired partners and other lawyers from Stroock, helping them quickly expand in New York and elsewhere.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Much of the Stroock dissolution coverage is partner focused, but we want to know how the rest of the firm is faring. Are you an associate at Stroock who’s found a home at another Biglaw firm? Are you using this as [an opportunity to change tracks for a boutique](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cohen-ziffers-managing-partner-on-why-choosing-a-boutique-firm-may-be-the-best-career-move-you-make/)?

# Biglaw Firm Changes Tack After Diversity Lawsuit
## The Supreme Court has forced changes to Biglaw's diversity programs.

Perkins Coie, one of the Biglaw firms under fire for its diversity fellowship, has decided to rewrite its program in light of the Supreme Court’s recent decision dismantling affirmative action in colleges. In August, Perkins and Morrison & Foerster were [sued over their fellowships](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/two-biglaw-firms-sued-over-diversity-initiatives/). The plaintiff is The American Alliance for Equal Rights, founded by Edward Blum — the same person behind Students for Fair Admissions, the plaintiff in the affirmative action Supreme Court case.

According to a[ statement ](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/about-us/firm/diversity/diversity-recruitment.html)on the firm’s website, the new fellowship will be open to all, as opposed to its previous program which was for applicants from “historically underrepresented” groups, but is designed to still promote diversity.

The new Diversity and Inclusion Fellowship Program expands the applicant pool to all and clarifies the factors that the firm will consider in selecting fellows. The revised criteria will ensure that the firm continues to hire accomplished lawyers with a diversity of backgrounds and experiences. These changes arose from an update to Perkins Coie’s D&I policies that began shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College case earlier this year.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Genhi Givings Bailey, Perkins Coie’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, commented on the change, saying, “Our new Diversity and Inclusion Fellowship Program continues Perkins Coie’s long-standing and deep-rooted commitment to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion within our firm and across the legal profession. We are proud of our firm’s progress and even as the legal landscape evolves, our commitment to strengthening diversity and creating a more inclusive workplace remains steadfast.”

The well-crafted statement on diversity is only a part of the firm’s commitment to diversity. Attorneys also have a 50-billable-hour credit they can use for DEI-related activities — a program unlikely to be impacted by the new legal landscape.

Previously, Senator [Tom Cotton threatened Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/tom-cotton-threatens-top-biglaw-firms-over-their-diversity-inclusion-initiatives/) over their DEI initiatives. However, the industry[ hasn’t done much](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/biglaw-firms-dont-seem-to-care-about-tom-cottons-anti-diversity-legal-threats/) more than shrug in response to that threat.

# Why The Anti-Résumé Provokes Such Strong Reactions

Several weeks ago, I suggested that, when people draft their résumés, they should be required simultaneously to draft [their anti-résumés](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/3135964485077648547), highlighting all the failures in their lives — awards they didn’t win, clerkships they didn’t obtain, firms that didn’t hire them, trials they lost, and the rest.

The reaction to this column was fierce, with some readers saying the idea of writing an anti-résumé was a terrible one, sure to depress people and likely to cause suicides. How could I have written such dangerous words?

On the other hand, many people reacted to the column differently: “That was the funniest thing I’ve read in a long time! Thanks for writing it!”

Why the divide?

The audience at Above the Law, of course, contains many categories of people.  Some of those people are high-achieving folks who went to the best law schools, served on law reviews, landed fancy clerkships, and are now partners at the finest firms in the country.

The vast majority of readers, of course, don’t fall into that category.

Who you are affects how you react to what I write.

I wrote the anti-résumé column as a joke. As an in-house lawyer, I’m bombarded by résumés of people telling me how great they are: I should hire them for in-house jobs; I should retain them for big litigation; and so on. Sitting in my place, you too might think that folks should be required to write an anti-résumé: The whole world is insisting that it’s great, and it’s not really that great. Wouldn’t it be funny if people had to tell the truth?

On the other hand, if you’re consumed by the idea of professional “success” — good grades, fancy clerkship, fancy job — and you’ve never attained that traditional success, then you might not view the idea of an anti-résumé as a cute joke. Rather, you might be bemoaning your lack of “success” in life and dismayed by the thought that you should be required to wallow in your self-evident “failures.” If you had to draft an anti-résumé, that could drive you over the edge — to drink, to drugs, to suicide. How could I have proposed such a thing?

I surely hope that the piece of my readership that I didn’t hear from falls into a different category — a well-adjusted middle. I assume that my average reader is average — went to an average school, performed about average, and went on to an average career. But if that hypothetical reader is emotionally secure and well-adjusted, then that reader should be satisfied with his or her life: Success is not, after all, a function of grades or clerkships or partnerships.

Success is, more or less, leaving the world a better place for your having lived in it.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
With luck, you get to live your threescore years and ten. During that time, did you improve the lives of your friends and family? Of your community or the world at large? Did you appreciate the good times as you lived them? Did you help those in need?

I think — I hope — that emotionally well-adjusted readers smiled at my joke about the anti-résumé.

But the reactions to the column made me more sensitive to the spectrum of readers who visit Above the Law.

# Perhaps Comedians Could Provide Viral Moments For Politicians In Debates?
## Most moments that go viral these days are nasty ones. We don't need our national discourse to become nastier than it already is.

Political debates are not about policy. No one cares about policy.

Political debates are a little bit about politicians’ height and weight and hair. People love to talk about that.

Political debates are a great deal about whether politicians seem like the kind of people you’d like to have a beer with. Political scientists say that matters.

But, more than anything else, in today’s environment, political debates are about politicians’ ability to create viral moments. If a politician can say something — anything — that can be caught in a 30-second sound bite and circulated around the internet, that’s victory.

Unfortunately, most moments that go viral these days are nasty ones. One politician says something vindictive about another, pulling the second person up short; the internet loves it. That might be good for one of the politicians, but it’s bad for America. We don’t need our national discourse to become nastier than it already is.

Here’s a thought: Why don’t politicians hire comedians to work on their staffs?

Jokes go viral all the time. If a politician told a good joke, the politician would be almost certain to go viral.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Surely a good comedian could come up with three or four short, pithy, jocular, and meaningful one- or two-liners for politicians to hold in their back pockets during a debate. If the opportunity arose, a politician could spring one, creating a viral moment that showed them to be clever, friendly, funny, and just the sort of person you’d like to have a beer with.

I don’t mean nasty humor; that defeats half the purpose of this. I mean clever, funny, nice, or perhaps self-deprecating humor. I’m thinking of 73-year-old Ronald Reagan, accused of being too old to run for a second term, telling Walter Mondale that Reagan wouldn’t hold Mondale’s  “[youth and inexperience](https://www.reaganfoundation.org/ronald-reagan/reagan-quotes-speeches/debate-between-the-president-and-former-vice-president-walter-f-mondale-in-kansas-city-missouri/)” against him in the 1984 campaign.

Or, perhaps not as memorably, [Al Gore telling Jack Kemp](https://www.britannica.com/list/11-memorable-quotes-from-us-presidential-debates) during the 1996 vice-presidential debate that: “If you won’t use any football stories, I won’t tell any of my warm and humorous stories about chlorofluorocarbon abatement.”

Those debates were before the age of social media, so you can’t be sure that the one-liners would have gone viral. But I suspect they would have; they’re perfect for the medium.

Funny one-liners would win attention for politicians, show the politicians to be affable and witty, and surely raise their standing in the polls.

Politicians can’t do much about their height or appearance, but they could do an awful lot to make the public think that they were personable. Aren’t they missing a trick not putting a comedian on the staff?

# Summer Associate Hopes Firm Meeting Doesn't Interfere With Gym Time
## Not every question is a good question.

Once more, Biglaw enters the summer season and that means we’re due for Summer Associates making a string of professional errors befitting a rookie attorney. Usually we have to wait until [somebody gets drunk](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/08/a-collection-of-funny-summer-associate-stories-from-a-bygone-age/), a development that’s becoming [increasingly rare in Biglaw programs](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-summer-programs-phasing-out-boozefests-to-create-all-new-worse-sexual-harassment-opportunities/). This time we have a summer who’s on a strong enough health kick that he really wants to skip the morning meeting:

Is attendance at the 7:30am breakfast mandatory? I already wake up at 5am to make it to the gym before work. I’m not sure I can handle a 3am wakeup time.

Or you could skip the gym for one day instead of blowing off a professional meeting. It’s hard to imagine this breakfast meeting is a daily event throughout the summer. If it is, start working out in the evenings. At least consider these before asking a firm attorney to skip out.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Also… four and a half hours of gym time? Good for you!

This “Summer As-SWOLE-ciate” provides a teachable moment for all Summers: if you’re invited to something as a Summer… you should treat it as mandatory. Your role at this stage in your career is to throw yourself into every professional opportunity. Demonstrate an eagerness to take on everything, especially an entirely low-impact morning practice group meeting.

We have no idea how this email exchange ended up, but we assume the query was shot down prompting the follow-up, “do you even lift, bro?”

# Kirkland Uses Its Immense Wealth In Pursuit Of Associates
## It's the hottest associate lateral market in history, and Kirkland is making moves.

We told you the associate [lateral market is hot like fire](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/) rn. And boy, we weren’t kidding. We all know — and have covered ad nauseam — that [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/) are sweeping through the elite of Biglaw, which are likely part of a calculated move to keep associates happy enough to stay put at their current firms. And [other perks](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/dont-throw-clients-under-the-bus-unless-theyre-protesters/) are being thrown into the mix — like[ $1,000 worth of takeout](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/kirkland-sweetens-associate-perks-with-free-food/?rf=1) or [$1,500 in exercise equipment](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/grading-all-the-davis-polk-gift-bonuses/).

But Biglaw giants looking to entice associates away from their firms are also here to play. And Kirkland & Ellis, the firm consistently taking in the most money in gross revenue, has plenty of money to throw at new hires. As [reported by Law.com](https://www.law.com/2021/04/28/kirkland-emerges-as-top-competitor-in-associate-talent-battle/), they aren’t shy about it either:

For instance, Kirkland offered a third-year associate at another firm a $150,000 signing bonus; offered another candidate $50,000, plus a possible top year-end bonus and an earlier path to partnership; and offered a retention bonus to a current associate to match a signing bonus from another firm, according to a source familiar with the bonuses.

In fact, Chicago-based recruiter Kay Hoppe characterizes this as “the most aggressive associate market in history,” so it’s no wonder firms are doing everything in their power to woo the best associates:

“I handle elite partner [moves]. Everybody wants them, But more than them, they need associates,” Hoppe said. “There’s more need than there is talent. And I wouldn’t fault Kirkland or anybody else for doing what they are doing for bringing in top associates.”

“The whole thing is upside down right now,” she said about the demand for associates compared with partners. “I have no problem with a firm offering a great associate the world, because they’re needed. And the best of the best provide something that is invaluable to the clients, to the partners and to their peers.”

It’s good to see firms realizing they need to up their game to keep their associates or to attract new ones. And for all the associates out there, go find your bliss (or at least the Biglaw firm that can give you the nearest simulacrum of happy).

In our coverage of the [Great Associate Salary Raise of 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/), we’ve focused on the Biglaw perspective, examining the compensation increases from the perspective of associates, counsel, and partners. But what about the people who ultimately make the pay raises possible: the clients?

In response to Ron Friedmann’s tweet, I had this exchange with former in-house lawyer Casey Flaherty:

[@DavidLat](https://twitter.com/DavidLat) [@ronfriedmann](https://twitter.com/ronfriedmann) That's specious. It's not like they stay first years. They get a salary bump every year. Larger than in-house.

— D. Casey Flaherty (@DCaseyF) [June 6, 2016](https://twitter.com/DCaseyF/status/739938668337606656)

Flaherty isn’t the only current or former in-house counsel with reservations about the Biglaw pay raises. Here is what our very own [Susan Moon](https://abovethelaw.com/author/susan-moon/) had to say when I reached out to her:

In general, I don’t think that first associate salaries are reflective of the value that these lawyers provide their clients. Perhaps it depends upon the type of legal work (e.g., students get some more litigation-related training in law school (moot court, legal writing, etc.), compared to transactional law training, which most lawyers get absolutely none of in law school), but first year associates are basically learning on the job and making tons of mistakes early on as corporate associates. What other industry pays top dollar for service providers who have minimal to no training? Even doctors who graduate after 4 years of med school get much lower pay during their residency (i.e., training) years.

And no self-respecting large law firm will let a first year’s work product go out unchecked by a more senior attorney, so instead of billing just the first year attorney’s time, the senior attorney’s time gets billed as well (when the senior attorney alone could have sufficiently completed the work). I think it really evidences a large law firm disconnect from reality (paying huge salaries for subpar value provided). Because of this, many large companies that have the leverage refuse to pay for first year associates’ billables. I understand that junior attorneys need training, but considering how much money these large firms make, why should the client have to pay for it?

Fellow Above the Law in-house columnist [Mark Herrmann](https://abovethelaw.com/author/mark-herrmann/), a longtime Biglaw partner before he went in-house, sounded less opposed:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The raise affects different people at different times. For associates, the effect is immediate: They get a raise next month. For partners, the effect is delayed: They may be paid less — next month or in nine months, depending on how profits are distributed – if the firm’s (and their own) performance was the same this year as last. And clients don’t notice the change, if at all, until the next negotiation over rates.

Even then, we’re not negotiating rates with ‘the market.’ We’re negotiating rates with three or four key firms that were surely affected by many things over the past year other than an increase in associate salaries. Thus: For associates, enjoy your new-found wealth. For clients, I suspect it’s wait and see.

I’m closer to Mark’s view than to Susan’s. This sentence is key: “clients don’t notice the change, if at all, until the next negotiation over rates.”

In the near-decade since [Simpson Thacher raised to the $160K scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/), Biglaw firms have been raising rates on clients every year (at least nominally; there has been some discounting, especially in the wake of the Great Recession, but that’s harder to track). But during this whole time, associate base salaries haven’t budged (yes, bonuses have been good in recent years, but they’re not guaranteed and come at year-end).

If law firms raise rates regularly, shouldn’t their hardworking associates benefit from some of that increase? It seems reasonable to me to shift some of the compensation risk back toward the partners, which is essentially what happens when associates get bigger base salaries. (Waiting until the end of the year and paying good bonuses, while nice, forces associates to share with partners the risk of how the year goes — even though associates don’t get partner-size rewards for a good year.)

I think Craig Silliman, general counsel of Verizon, put the point very well (commenting to Casey Sullivan for a very interesting [Big Law Business piece](https://bol.bna.com/is-following-cravaths-lead-the-best-way-to-set-salaries/) on whether the “follow Cravath” model of setting comp makes sense):

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
To the degree that law firms are reallocating their profits by giving first year associates higher salaries, then this is about their internal business model and it doesn’t affect me. We don’t pay for first year associate work, but to the degree that the firms are raising salaries across the board and they try to push through these pay increases in higher billing rates, then it simply encourages me to look for alternatives, whether moving the work in-house or moving work to lower-price firms.

Exactly. To put it another way, going from $160K to $180K represents a 12.5 percent increase, but no firm will (or will be able to) hike rates on clients by 12.5 percent in the next negotiation. So this associate pay raise really is, as Silliman puts it, about Biglaw’s internal business model. If firms try to pass too much of their increased overhead on to clients, the clients will balk — and in this day and age, with competition from great [boutiques](https://abovethelaw.com/boutique-law-firms/) and [alternative legal services providers](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/alt-legal/), clients have significant leverage.

To all our in-house readers, especially those who did Biglaw stints before moving to the client side, don’t begrudge Biglaw associates their pay raises. They have way more student debt than you ever did; they need that extra cash to pay their bills. You still have interesting work, a great mix of legal and business issues, and — on the whole, there are exceptions — better work-life balance.

Rest assured that, even after their latest raises, most Biglaw associates would kill to be in-house counsel.

# 5 Reasons Why You Shouldn’t Wait For Your Bonus To Keep Looking
## Instead, you can leave like a boss… on your own terms.

It’s almost the end of the year, you’re barely holding on, but a $25,000 bonus looms on the horizon. You should delay your lateral search and collect your bonus, right? Absolutely not; now is the best time to initiate a lateral search, especially if you are unhappy with your firm. That yearly windfall may make you temporarily complacent, but here’s why you should not leave your lateral search until after you collect your bonus.

1) All of your colleagues are already looking. Yes, every time you knock on their door and your hear them say, “I’m gonna have to call you back,” or, “Let me circle back up with you later,” they were on the phone with a recruiter (probably me) discussing your dream job. By the time you start ramping up your search, they could be finishing their callback. Stay ahead of your peers by prepping as soon as possible for a lateral move.

2) If you feel that you are ready to explore other opportunities, your bonus should not change your mind. No matter how large that number is, it should not sway a decision you have been thinking about for a long time. In the long run, a better fitting firm will pay dividends in multiples of any potentially lost bonus.

3) Take a look at these numbers: The conventional wisdom is that associates don’t move until they get their bonuses, and then positions open up. While this is true to a degree, the numbers don’t lie. Here, we can see that firms are continually opening positions based on needs, and the “bonus musical chairs” may not affect firm hiring as much as we all think. More positions were opened in January and February than were opened in April-May. The numbers show that demand is relatively stable throughout the year, contrary to conventional wisdom.


4) On average, it takes about two to three months from search to hire for an associate lateral. However, it can take up to six months for more difficult searches. You don’t want to be stuck in a miserable job for an entire year longer. The end of the year was time to take stock of your career, but if you didn’t do that while you were home with friends and family complaining about your job, it’s not too late. By the time you finally summon the will to respond to my email, you may be sitting at your desk, ordering on Postmates thinking, “If I can only make it till my bonus in 2020.” This may seem like it’s not that far away, but by that time, you could have easily integrated yourself into a new firm or in-house position.

5) You’ll get to leave like a boss… on your own terms. What’s better than pocketing a five-figure bonus check and dropping the mic briefcase on the way out. If you plan properly, you can ensure that there is little lag time between receiving your bonus and starting at your new firm. Or if you feel a little burned out, ask your new firm for a few weeks off before you start and spend the bonus on a trip to Australia, or the next Fyre Festival if you feel like you have cash to burn. They are usually pretty accommodating about lateral start dates.

# Top 10 Biglaw Firm Ponies Up Money For Hardworking Associates
## Sidley weighs in on the Biglaw salary wars.

What better way for a Biglaw firm to let associates know much their work is appreciated than with a nice raise? And thanks to the new market standard set by the combination of Milbank and Davis Polk, firms are doing just that.

The latest firm to say thank you with cold, hard cash is Sidley Austin. The firm took in $2,462,935,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it number 6 on the Am Law 100, and they are happy to share their good fortune with the associates who made it all possible.

As expected, the firm matched the prevailing market compensation as detailed in the chart below:

Class of 2021	$215,000
Class of 2020	$225,000
Class of 2019	$250,000
Class of 2018	$293,500
Class of 2017	$335,000
Class of 2016	$360,500
Class of 2015	$381,000
Class of 2014	$396,500
And like many of their peer firms, the raises will be retroactive to January 1 and will hit bank accounts in March. Read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/sidley-raises-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# How Biglaw (And Other Employers) Make It Worse For Women
## You aren't crazy, the workplace is working against you.

On the latest episode of The Jabot podcast I talk with [Andie Kramer and Al Harris](https://andieandal.com/), about their new book, [It’s Not You, It’s The Workplace, Women’s Conflict At Work At The Bias That Built It](https://andieandal.com/books/its-not-you-its-the-workplace/). We discuss the stereotypes that exist about women in the workplace and how they work to hurt women and their careers.

And, of course since Andie and Al have a ton of experience in the legal profession (he ran his own firm for years and she’s a partner at McDermott Will & Emery), we dish on Biglaw. The unique challenges for women in Biglaw, and importantly, what firms can do to improve the situation all get aired out.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

# The Path To In-House Just Got Easier At This Biglaw Firm
## Imagine that -- a firm that actually cares about the career development of their associates.

Despite the droves of young attorneys that flock to major law firms after law school graduation, Biglaw isn’t the long-term plan for most attorneys. Whether it’s the hours, the stress, or the up-or-out model — Biglaw isn’t the long-term plan for most. Sure, it’s a great place to learn a lot — and pay down student debt — but many yearn for the green grass of in-house life. And one Biglaw firm is trying to make that transition easier.

[Earlier this week](https://www.huschblackwell.com/inthenews/husch-blackwell-launches-hb-in-house-a-unique-career-development-program-to-help-lawyers-transition-to-in-house-roles-and-enhance-client-service), Husch Blackwell launched HB In-House, a professional development program designed to help attorneys at the firm who are interested in making the leap to in-house. The program’s goals are two-fold: 1) provide attorneys with an inside view of their clients’ roles and responsibilities; and 2) for those attorneys interested in moving in-house, provide them with the tools necessary for a successful transition to an in-house position.

How refreshing for a firm to admit its attorneys may want to move, and to provide opportunities toward that end for everyone. Too often, the transition to the next phase in an attorney’s career is left to the chance of the matters you happen to be placed on or personal connections. This program creates a clear path for those interested in exploring options other than Biglaw. Chief Client Officer Angela Quinn said, “There is nothing like this in the marketplace right now and is another example of our uncommon approach to running a law firm and serving our clients and our people. We recognize that not everyone wants to follow the traditional partner track, and this is our way of ensuring that we are training our lawyers to grow by providing them varied career opportunities to accomplish that. We are already a top supplier of in-house talent, and we see this as a great service to our clients as we train future generations of in-house talent.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Twenty-five of the firm’s clients helped to create the curriculum for HB In-House. Joe Glynias, Chair and HB In-House program architect, said, “It is not possible to capture the gratitude we have for these client partners who gave and will give so much of their time to help build a future for other attorneys who want to better understand the role and life of in-house counsel. We are fortunate to have such committed partners, and we know there are countless more who will team with us as the program progresses.”

So what, exactly will participants learn in the first iteration of the program?

-
Education: Participants will learn about the roles and responsibilities of in-house attorneys, the structure of legal teams, and the differences between private practice and in-house legal work. This information will help them assess if an in-house position aligns with their career goals. 

-
Training: The training series will cover topics such as understanding a company’s business and how legal departments support business goals, managing a budget, comprehending key financial statements and reports, identifying, assessing, managing and mitigating risks, building relationships and being part of a team, and developing leadership skills. Participants will actively engage in learning these skills and applying them to real-world scenarios. 

-
Coaching: During the course period, attorneys will have access to various coaching programs. These programs include individual coaching, the opportunity to join a coaching cohort, and being paired with an in-house advisor to receive guidance and mentorship. Additionally, attorneys may be offered the chance to participate in a secondment, which will provide an immersive experience. 

Kudos to the firm for the innovative program that marries the needs of associates and clients in a way that helps everyone.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I started my career in New York working for civil rights organizations. So while my move can be perceived as a dramatic change or a leap—and it is in a sense that the art world is new to me—there’s a piece of this aligned with my values and what I’ve done in the past in the pro bono space.

— [Mitchell Kamin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitch-kamin-b3289a9/), who formerly served as co-leader of Covington & Burling’s commercial litigation practice, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/ex-covington-lawyer-to-cram-on-star-wars-for-lucas-museum-job) on his new role as the first general counsel of the [Lucas Museum of Narrative Art](https://lucasmuseum.org/), founded by George Lucas and his wife. To be more effective in his new role, Kamin told Bloomberg that he needs to “bone up” on all things related to the “Star Wars” universe. The museum will officially open its doors in 2025.

# Did Firms Raise Salaries High Enough?
## Is $180,000 high enough?

Deborah Merritt, a law professor at the Ohio State University, published an informative [analysis](http://www.lawschoolcafe.org/2016/06/20/180000/) on her blog yesterday about the new market rate salary for large law firms, which has been extensively covered [here](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/) on ATL.

To her and virtually every other observer, the increase to $180,000 signals that many large firms are prospering. In part the increase reflects a small but steady increase in associate productivity since 2008, reaching roughly the levels from the last market rate increase in 2007. The following chart is from the [2016 Report on the State of the Legal Market](http://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/upload/2016_PM_GT_Final-Report.pdf), issued by Georgetown Law’s Center for the Study of the Legal Profession:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Associates are continuously more productive by this measure than any other category of worker, although at lower billable rates than partners. Interestingly, the gap in productivity between associates and other groups is significantly greater post-recession.

What’s most interesting, however, is the comparison between total salary expenditures in 2008 versus 2015. According to Professor Merritt’s calculations, large law firms are spending between $200 and $300 million less on associates than they were in 2008 — and this accounts for the latest salary increase.

She uses the number of new graduates at firms with 500 or more lawyers as a proxy for the number of graduates obtaining jobs paying market rate. In 2008, that number was [5,193](http://www.nalp.org/uploads/natlsummary2008.pdf). In 2015, it was 4,008. Professor Merritt points out that entry-level hiring has changed at the largest law firms, so these numbers are not directly comparable.

But after 2008, firms began bifurcating their entry-level hiring. They continued to hire new associates at top salaries, but they also retained staff attorneys at much lower salaries. Orrick began employing “career associates” at a Wheeling, West Virginia, office in [2009](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/business/24lawyers.html?pagewanted=1&_r=0#). WilmerHale followed with a Dayton, Ohio, office for staff attorneys in [2010](https://www.wilmerhale.com/pages/publicationsandNewsDetail.aspx?NewsPubId=101302).

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Based on data from NALP about 2014 graduates, she believes the number of new associates who just got or are about to get their pay bumped is between 3,500 and 4,000.

I’ve taken her figures and put it into the following table:

Year	Salary	# of Positions	Nominal Dollars	2015 Constant Dollars
2008	$160,000	5,193	$831 million	$915 million
2015	$180,000	3,500	$630 million	–
2015	$180,000	4,000	$720 million	–
I use different assumptions, but come to a similar conclusion. I start with the number of graduates at firms with more than 500 attorneys. I reduce that by a small percentage (5%) to account for the firms that did not pay associates New York market. I then add the number of graduates at firms with more than 250 attorneys, but only after reducing that number by a larger percentage (40%) to account for the non-market paying firms. The result is an estimate of 5,950 in 2008 and 5,038 in 2015, a 15% decline in headcount.

My table looks like this:

2015	$180,000	4,200	$755 million	–
2015	$180,000	5,000	$900 million	–
As Professor Merritt did, I gave a range in 2015 to account for the compositional change in 2015. The total amount spent on associate salaries (using my assumptions) reduced by between $105 million and $250 million.

However — and Professor Merritt acknowledges this in her post — firms are spending some of those savings on non-associate attorneys. Overhead, including health insurance, likely increased at firms too. Moreover, neither analysis looks at bonuses.

Most importantly, we have little idea whether the remaining savings went to partners or to reducing prices for clients. Certainly that varies. What we can be sure of is that the changes in spending and base salaries were expected. On that I will give Professor Merritt the final word:

Indeed, the pattern we are now seeing — higher salaries for a smaller number of elite lawyers — is exactly what we would expect in a market characterized by disaggregation, globalization, and technological gains. Those forces make individual lawyers more productive, which allows salary increases. The same trends, however, decrease the number of new lawyers needed to do the same work. The impact is particularly acute at the top of the any work chain, because those lawyers incorporate the productivity gains of the lawyers beneath them.

# Getting A Biglaw Gig In St. Louis Just Got A Little Easier

There are plenty of reasons to relocate to St. Louis. There’s their [world famous zoo](https://www.ksdk.com/article/features/saint-louis-zoo-wins-8th-best-zoo-usa-today-poll/63-ece721a7-eeb5-40d1-8a8b-9ab4333a38e1#:~:text=Readers%20voted%20the%20Saint%20Louis,USA%20Today%20Readers'%20Choice%20Awards.), [culinarily accidents](https://www.mamasonthehill.com/history#:~:text=Birth%20of%20an%20instant%20classic,were%20removed%20but%20not%20discarded.), and [a vanity project dozens o’ millions dollar trolly on the Loop that literally no one asked for](https://www.wupr.org/2022/03/06/trolley-failure-may-cost-st-louis-37-million/). But if you’re looking for a good reason, the legal market is booming. And if that’s enough reason for Quarles & Brady to move Midwest, they’re probably worth following. From [Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/02/am-law-200-interest-in-missouri-ramps-up-as-quarles-launches-in-st-louis/?kw=Am%20Law%20200%20Interest%20in%20Missouri%20Ramps%20Up%2C%20as%20Quarles%20Launches%20in%20St.%20Louis&utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_campaign=newsroomupdate&utm_content=20231102&utm_term=tal&oly_enc_id=9241F9834912G4T):

After consecutive combinations earlier this year that put the Am Law 200 firm in San Diego and Denver, Milwaukee-based Quarles & Brady is opening another new office a little closer to home.

The firm, ranked No. 112, has added an outpost in St. Louis after a string of additions over the last several months that includes leading labor and employment partners from Armstrong Teasdale.

Firm leaders said this week that Gateway City had been on its map for a while, noting its industry strength in practices such as health care and financial services that align well with its own practices, as well as its proximity to other Quarles offices. But they also stated that momentum picked up earlier this year with the addition of Sarah Sise, an employee benefits partner from Armstrong, in April.

Goes to show how much change an addition to the firm can make. Make the most of the city and expect a bunch of applicants from WashU and SLU!

It’s been two months since the special bonus party started in Biglaw, and firms are still announcing monetary tokens of appreciation to attorneys whose billable hours are propelling firms to success.

After experiencing a [4.1 percent increase](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2021/04/01/sans-pandemic-related-austerity-cuts-loeb-loeb-saw-profits-up-8-5/) in revenue from 2019 (and a 8.5 percent increase in profits per equity partner), Loeb & Loeb has decided to spread the love to associates, counsel, and income partners. That’s right, the Los Angeles-based firm has announced special bonuses that match the market rate, set by Davis Polk in March.

Payments will be made in June and December, according to the following schedule:

To be eligible for the bonuses, associates have to bill 1,950 hours, annualized, with an opportunity for a catch-up payment if you fail to meet the hours by the first payment date. You can read the firm’s[ full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/loeb-loeb-special/2/)

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# From Pro Basketball To Biglaw, No Matter The Court, You'll Still Work Your Ass Off

In basketball, working yourself to death physically pays off to a certain point, but then you have to be careful because you don’t want to get injured. It’s similar here. I have to put things down and go home.

Now it’s time to be a champion in a different court. And this time I get to win on behalf of someone else. That’s the piece I’m really looking forward to.

# The Biglaw Firms With The Most Female Equity Partners

Earlier today, we brought our readersthe latest edition of the [Am Law A-List](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/the-2017-a-list-arrives-to-salve-that-itch-you-had-for-another-law-firm-ranking-this-week/), a ranking that highlights the overall quality of law firms based on factors like revenue per lawyer, pro bono commitment, associate satisfaction, and racial diversity. This year, for the first time ever, the A-List ranking incorporated into its overall calculation a score for the percentage of each firm’s female equity partners. As noted previously, the inclusion of this score had a major impact on the A-List rankings; in fact, some firms were booted from the Top 10 due to the lack of women in their equity partnership ranks.

Which led us to wonder: which Biglaw firms had the highest percentage of female equity partners? Earlier this week, we reported on a study from [Law360](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/best-biglaw-firms-for-women-who-actually-want-to-make-partner/) that ranked firms based on the ratio of female equity partners to male equity partners, so we thought we already knew the answer. Was that study incorrect, or are we so desperate for rankings related to women in law firms that another website regurgitated the same information using different phrasing? We think it may be the latter, as this is the third ranking released this week that largely has to do with women’s roles as equity partners in law firms.

So, which Am Law 200 firms have the most women in their equity partnership ranks? Here are the Top 10, as ranked by the American Lawyer:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- Fragomen Del Rey: 41 percent
- BuckleySandler: 33.30 percent
- Littler Mendelson: 29.20 percent
- Holland & Hart: 26.40 percent
- Schiff Hardin: 25.60 percent
- Ballard Spahr: 25.20 percent
- Brownstein Hyatt: 25.20 percent
- Jackson Lewis: 24.90 percent
- Davis Wright Tremaine: 24.40 percent
- Wiley Rein: 24.30 percent
Congratulations to all 10 of these firms for their willingness to give women a seat at the table in their equity partnership meetings. (But it’s disheartening to congratulate firms where more than 50 percent of equity partners are men, and in some cases, more than 75 percent are men.)

Am Law’s ranking is only a little more interesting than Law360’s because it shows us the Biglaw firms where women have the least representation in their equity partnership ranks. Here are the Top 10 offenders with the lowest representation of women in their equity partnership ranks:

- Kasowitz Benson: 2.60 percent
- Rutan & Tucker: 6.00 percent
- Procopio Cory: 7.10 percent
- Archer & Greiner: 7.30 percent
- Moore & Van Allen: 7.60 percent
- Curtis Mallet-Prevost: 8.30 percent
- Carlton Fields: 8.70 percent
- Clark Hill: 8.90 percent
- Gordon Rees: 9.10 percent
- Burr & Forman: 9.10 percent
- Shutts & Bowen: 9.20 percent
- Irell & Manella: 9.20 percent

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Just beyond the Top 10 here, we see well-known firms like Vinson & Elkins (9.60 percent), DLA Piper (10.10 percent), Schulte Roth (10.80 percent), and Winston & Strawn (10.90 percent — though the firm has a wonderful [gender-neutral parental leave program](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/biglaw-firm-makes-big-waves-with-gender-neutral-parental-leave-policy/)), with just barely 10 percent of their equity partnership ranks filled out by women. This is a big problem.

Some of these firms should be applauded for their efforts to increase gender diversity, but some of them ought to be shamed. It’s obvious that there is still much, much more work to be done to improve women’s footing in the largest law firms in America, and change can’t come quickly enough.

“I never cried when Pac died / But I probably will when Hov does / And if my tears hold value then I would drop one / For every single thing he showed us.” — [Drake](https://genius.com/Drake-fear-lyrics)

Earlier this month, [Sponsors for Educational Opportunity (SEO) Law](http://www.seolaw.org/) wrapped up its two-week intensive academic and career development [training program](http://www.seolaw.org/program/training/) for 2017.

The SEO Law Fellowship is a [paid legal internship program](http://www.seolaw.org/program/fellowship/) that provides guidance to pre-law students on corporate etiquette, law firm expectations of summer interns, legal research and writing, networking, and much more.

After completing the training program, and prior to enrolling in their first semester of law school, SEO Law Fellows will spend a summer with one of the nation’s leading law firms. The program has over 1,300 alumni, including more than 650 who graduated from law school within the last 7 years.

This week, I had the opportunity to catch up with [Van Ann Bui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanannbui/), Director of the SEO Law Fellowship Program. Since being selected in 2009 as a [1L New York City Bar Diversity Fellow](http://www.nycbar.org/serving-the-community/diversity-and-inclusion/student-pipeline-programs/programs/diversity-bar-fellowship-program), she has been extremely [passionate](https://twitter.com/vanannbui?lang=en) about and involved in promoting diversity and inclusion in the legal profession.

Former Biglaw attorneys like Van Ann Bui, who have made it their mission to improve our industry, are role models for the rest of us. Bui and I had a fantastic discussion regarding how pre-1Ls can succeed in their legal education and careers.

The following is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

RC: You were fortunate enough to participate in the New York City Bar’s Diversity Fellowship Program during your first summer of law school. Can you tell us more about this program and your experience?

VB: Absolutely! The New York City Bar’s Committee on Recruitment & Retention of Lawyers sponsors the City Bar’s [Diversity Fellowship Program](http://www.nycbar.org/serving-the-community/diversity-and-inclusion/student-pipeline-programs/programs/diversity-bar-fellowship-program), which provides summer internships at top law firms, corporations and government law departments across the city to first-year law students from underrepresented backgrounds who attend law school in the New York area.

Students are required to submit an application package, which includes preparing a legal memo and personal statement, to their law schools.

The participating law schools interview and select a certain number of their students to move on to interview with a panel of attorneys and other school representatives who sit on the City Bar’s Committee. From there, students are placed by the Committee at one of the Fellowship’s partner organizations.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
I am forever grateful that the Committee placed me at Proskauer that summer. I had an incredible experience at the firm – I was placed directly into the firm’s Summer Associate program and had the opportunity to work on interesting projects.

I went on to spend my 2L summer at Proskauer and am fortunate to have started my career there, where I continued to receive invaluable training and developed great relationships with my official (and unofficial) mentors – many of whom I still keep in touch with today. Without the City Bar’s Diversity Fellowship Program, I would not have had this opportunity.

RC: You were a Biglaw associate for nearly five years. What advice do you have for those who are thinking about law school and/or about to take the bar and follow the same path?

VB: Seek out as much formal and informal training as you can – whether that be at your own law firm or with other organizations, such as bar associations. Ask your supervising attorneys for feedback. I learned so much about how to be an effective communicator and attorney from the attorneys with whom I worked.

And start developing (or strengthening) relationships with your classmates and future co-workers. These are people who can help guide you throughout your career – they could one day be in a position to help you find your next job, get promoted, or send you referral clients.

I’ve been fortunate to have developed some very strong relationships with attorneys and other recruiting and diversity professionals throughout my career – at Proskauer, the NYC Bar Association, and otherwise. I would not be where I am without the guidance and mentorship of these individuals.

RC: Now you are the Director of the SEO Law Program. Can you share with us a little bit about SEO’s mission?

VB: Sure! Sponsors for Educational Opportunity has many wonderful programs aimed at providing academic and professional opportunities to underserved and underrepresented students. The [SEO Law Fellowship Program](http://www.seolaw.org/) works specifically to identify and recruit talented Black, Hispanic, and Native American students who are about to enter their first year of law school, to provide them with an internship at one of the nation’s leading law firms.

In addition to an internship, we require that our Fellows attend a two-week intensive academic and career development training program to help them develop necessary skills to excel in law school and in their internships.  

RC: You recently wrapped up the training program for pre-1Ls. How does one get selected to participate in this program, and what exactly does this program entail?

VB: To be selected for the program, students must submit an application form and provide us with a copy of their résumé, transcript, and personal statement. Students must apply to the program during the same cycle in which they are applying to law school.

Once a student’s application has been reviewed, s/he may be invited to an interview. Interviews are typically conducted in the spring. Once interviews have been completed, we require that students submit proof of enrollment in law school in order to be extended an offer to participate in the program.

Our training program focuses on providing opportunities for students to learn and develop certain skills that we think they should know in order to give them a running start in law school – skills such as reading and briefing a legal opinion, synthesizing a rule from a statute or a case, preparing law school outlines, and writing law school exams and legal memoranda. We supplement our skills-based seminars with subject-matter lectures.

This year, we had Professor Rachel Barkow of NYU teach a Criminal Law class and Professor Daniel Kelly of Notre Dame teach a Property Law class. At the end of each week, we administer an exam designed to simulate the law school exam experience.

In addition to the academic components, we provide career development workshops on topics such as networking and relationship-building and corporate culture/etiquette.

We also provide Panel Discussions and Networking Receptions each evening to allow our students to hear from and speak with top attorneys from our partner law firms regarding their practice areas and career paths.

RC: What were some of your favorite events from this year’s training program?

VB: I really enjoyed it all! But my highlights would have to be the Panel Discussions and Networking Receptions with attorneys from our partner law firms. We had discussions regarding different practice areas, the hiring partner’s perspective, and pro bono.

Our Fellows and panelists were so engaged and enthusiastic, especially during the networking portion – the venue had to kick us out each night! Another favorite moment was getting to hear Judge Raymond Joseph Lohier Jr., a judge who sits on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, speak to our Fellows.

Lastly, I was truly motivated each day by our Fellows’ energy and excitement – their hunger to learn motivates me to do the best job I can to help them succeed.

RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

VB: Never be afraid to ask for help – very few people (if any?) make it to the top of the ladder on their own. There will be many people willing to help – all you have to do is ask.

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Van Ann Bui for sharing her story with our audience. We wish her continued success in her career.

# Working At A Large Law Firm That Is Struggling Financially
## Spending your days with little useful work to perform can be more painful than being busy with work.

Before starting my own practice over two and a half years ago, I worked at several law firms. Some of the firms were doing well financially, others struggled either because of lack of work, administrative issues, or both. Working at a large law firm that is struggling financially can be a weird experience, both because of the pressure that finances place on firm employees and because the experiences of attorneys and staff at such firms are different than at other shops.

Perhaps most obviously, attorneys and staff at law firms that are struggling financially often have far less work than they do during normal times. Since it often takes a while for law firms to perform layoffs or otherwise reorganize their operations during periods of financial stress, people can sit idle for weeks, and even months, before something is done. One time, I worked at a firm that lost a major portfolio of work. As a result, dozens of attorneys and staff sat idle while firm management decided what they were going to do.

Although many of us had little to do, we had to come to the office early, and leave normally, with little billable work. The office became basically one big social club, in which people took long lunches, sat in each others’ offices chatting for hours, and just passed their time with little work. If there wasn’t a sense of dread hanging in the air about whether there would be layoffs, it would not have been a really unpleasant situation to be in. Nevertheless, and ironically, spending your days with little useful work to perform can be more painful than being busy with work since the days are longer and more boring, and this aspect of working at a firm that was struggling financially was not something I expected.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There are also significant interruptions in workflow at law firms that are struggling financially. At many large law firms, senior partners give work to junior partners, who in turn give work to senior associates, who then give work to junior associates. There are usually certain discrete tasks that belong to partners, like attending depositions and court hearings, and junior attorneys often complete the grunt work like with researching and drafting memos and conducting doc review. Administrative tasks are usually handled by secretaries and paralegals so that attorneys can stay focused on completing legal tasks that can typically be billed to clients at a higher billable hour rate.

When there is less work to do in an office — the cause of many firm financial issues — this workflow is interrupted. Partners start to hog work for themselves so that they can stay busy, and associates at the bottom of the food chain have the least amount of work to do. In many instances, junior associates may end up completing administrative work that is usually handled by secretaries and paralegals because there is simply no other work left to complete. This inefficiency can lead to problems since partners may not be as good at completing legal research and similar tasks as junior associates, and junior associates are typically not as good at completing administrative tasks as administrative professionals. Law firms should therefore try to avoid this breakdown in the workflow even if a firm is struggling financially since higher billing because more expensive professionals are completing tasks can strain client relations and make the financial situation at a firm even worse.

Another issue of working at a large law firm that is struggling financially is that this very negatively impacts the environment of working at the shop. Morale is down, and people have a feeling of dread over what will happen to their jobs and the firm because of financial issues. In addition, associates have to compete for smaller amounts of work in the hopes that keeping busy will save their jobs, which requires more office politics and brownnosing than usual. In addition, with more time on their hands than normal, attorneys and staff have little else than to gossip about the situation at the firm.

Sometimes, there is a weird kind of forced optimism about the firm. Attorneys and staff may convince themselves into thinking that things aren’t as bad as they are, and that they may not lose their jobs or suffer other adverse consequences because of the firm’s finances. Management may try to convince everyone that earlier efforts to “right the ship” have paid off despite all indications showing that a firm is still in a bad place.

All told, some people may think it is not too bad to work in a firm that is struggling financially since attorneys and staff have less work and more free time to use as they wish. However, working at a law firm that is struggling financially can be a miserable experience. Not only do attorneys and staff need to deal with more office politics and other undesirable aspects of working at a law firm, but the sense of dread that predominates a firm that is struggling can sour anyone’s work experience.

# People So 'Pissed' About Special Bonuses At This Biglaw Firm That They 'Want To Leave'
## Yikes....

As Biglaw special bonus season continues to roll on, associates who would normally have been thrilled by the news are finding it difficult to put on a happy face. Even though some firms are claiming on paper that they’ve “matched” the generous Davis Polk scale, there are stringent hourly requirements that seem designed to prevent associates from earning full market bonuses. These bonuses are supposed to reward associates for their hard work during the pandemic, and instead, they’re being left empty-handed in some cases. No wonder associates at these firms are so disgruntled.

According to our sources, that is what seems to be going on at Covington & Burling. The firm announced bonuses on Friday, and from what we’ve been told, associates are “disappointed.” Why’s that? These are the bonuses that the firm is offering (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/covington-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
These seem to be the prevailing market standard, but the devil here is in the details. The spring bonus at Covington, which is payable in May, is based upon an annualized hours requirement of 1950 for hours worked from April 1, 2020 to March 30, 2021. The year-end bonus is also based on an annualized hours requirement of 1950, but for hours worked during the “typical” bonus year (i.e., January through December). Not only does this screw associates whose practices were affected by the pandemic, but that means there’s no opportunity for associates to catch-up in their hours to earn back the spring bonus, because the next bonus period is based on hours logged during a completely different time frame.

“People are really pissed and want to leave,” reports one source. Here’s a more detailed account from another associate:

These conditions do not acknowledge the contributions of associates who did not make the hours benchmark during the pandemic for whatever reason. It does not take into account contributions of associates that did not have a full billable workload last spring at the beginning of the pandemic, those who started at the firm in the fall, or those who have had a slow start to 2021. Nor is this a match to the market. Other firms have not made the bonuses contingent on hours (let alone a yearlong period outside of the calendar year), nor have they delayed payment until next January. Associates were hoping that the firm would recognize all of our challenging experiences during the pandemic.

If you’re a Covington associate and want to sound off on your apparently less-than special bonuses, feel free to send a line to tips@abovethelaw.com — a fun or insightful response may make it into an update of this article.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
UPDATE (3:00 p.m.): This is what we’ve heard from other sources at Covington.

I agree with prior statements that the bonus criteria are tone deaf and do nothing to recognize the effort of people who were unable to make their hours due to the pandemic. Additionally, telling us with less than a month’s notice that the spring bonus would be based on the last 12 months is demoralizing, as it arbitrarily rewards people who had more hours over that randomly chosen 12-month period. This 12-month period is unfair to parents who had kids out of school during winter break and who were unable to work as many hours over the holidays. The terms of the spring bonus penalize the attorneys that have had the hardest time with the pandemic. I doubt that people will leave the firm over this, but it is a symptom of larger issues that have led to a flood of people leaving over the past year.

We’re not only upset by the conditions for receiving the bonus, but also the timing of the announcement. This happens every time. Covington waits until every other firm matches before announcing bonuses or compensation matches. It is sad that Covington has never even tried to be a leader in associate compensation. They are always the follower. And usually the last. It’s an utter embarrassment at this point.

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/covington-special-bonus-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Covington.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Departure Memo Subtly Burns Biglaw Firm Straight To Hell
## If your firm won't pay market salaries, others will.

We have documented Greenberg Traurig’s salary shenanigans as the firm, [first proudly](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/greenberg-traurig-explains-why-its-too-cheap-to-raise-associate-salaries/) and [then sketchily](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/having-promised-to-not-follow-the-market-this-firm-is-trying-to-quietly-pay-a-lucky-few/), refuses to pay market salaries. We have warned you that [recruiters are circling around the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/if-firms-dont-think-recruiters-will-go-after-them-for-not-raising-salaries-theyre-wrong-this-email-proves-it/) like sharks who smell blood in the water.

Greenberg management seems to think that associate unrest over the firm’s below market salaries is just a media narrative. But today we got a hold of a departure memo that puts that “narrative” into action. It’s an entirely normal memo, until you realize what’s really going on. Emphasis mine:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Subject: Farewell and Thank you

As many of you know, today is my last day at GT. I am very grateful for the opportunity to have worked with and learned from so many of you during my three years with the firm. GT has been an incredible place to cut my teeth in real estate law and I would particularly like to thank all of the members of the Real Estate Group in New York for making the firm a great place to learn and practice.

Next month I am starting at Milbank. I do not have my new work contact info yet, but if you wish to reach me my personal email is [redacted]

Thank you all and I hope that our paths cross at some point in the future.

I’ve redacted the associate’s name. But I can confirm that it’s a real person whose Google footprint all points to working at GT. Except when you go to their GT bio page today, it’s a big “Page Not Found.”

For those who are uninitiated to the Biglaw departure cycle, it is highly unusual for a person to leave in August. The fall bonus only gets paid out if you are still at the firm on the day that it drops, so working 3/4ths of the way towards your bonus and then just leaving it on the table is not something that people usually do.

But, remember the note from [our report on the RPN recruiter email](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/if-firms-dont-think-recruiters-will-go-after-them-for-not-raising-salaries-theyre-wrong-this-email-proves-it/?rf=1). The firm said: “Many of our clients that are paying the new Cravath salaries are making associates whole on the bonus and not pro-rating it.”

The message is that people who want to get out of Greenberg Traurig, can get out. And some people are getting out.

Leaving a firm that plays salary shenanigans for a firm that led the market in salary raises isn’t personal. It’s just business.

# Associate Layoffs And Staff Cuts Come To Am Law 50 Biglaw Firm
## Morale at the firm is reportedly pretty low.

There’s a lot going on at Winston & Strawn. The firm, ranked #40 on the latest Am Law 100 list, has reportedly been letting go a number of associates and staff over recent weeks.

The exact number of laid off associates is unclear, but tipsters have put the number at approximately ~10 percent of associates, which translates in the neighborhood of 30-40 attorneys. That’s a hefty chunk of associates out of work. Sources say they let go associates across multiple offices, and the severance package they’re being offered is either three months at 100 percent pay or six months at 50 percent pay. And as one tipster notes, the layoffs are not performance based:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I’m not writing in to hurt the firm. It’s important that the layoffs are publicized so that when the associates go to look for new jobs, they’re not penalized (similar to the 2012 summer associate debacle). I have not heard of anyone being fired for performance issues.

The staff situation is more complex. According to multiple tipsters, almost all secretarial staff positions have been eliminated and the firm will be creating new positions as part of a resource center. Early retirement or buyouts were reportedly offered to at least some staff members, and there will be an opportunity for now former staffers to apply — and test — for the newly created resource center jobs.

When Above the Law reached out to the firm for comment, a spokesperson for Winston had nothing to say about the associate layoffs. They did, however, respond to the staff cuts:

“In response to a fundamental shift across the legal industry in how clients and lawyers interact, Winston & Strawn is forming the Winston Resource Center, a virtual, cross-functional group that will provide 24/7 professional support services for attorneys and clients. This innovative restructuring addresses evolving work practices while improving operating efficiencies. As this model includes an elimination of certain roles, Winston will assist our valued, dedicated and appreciated employees either by transitioning them into newly created roles at the firm, offering early retirement opportunities or providing career counseling.”

This corresponds with sources at the firm saying the administrative upheaval has been in the works for some time. But, according to tipsters, folks are still pretty upset about the massive change taking place during a pandemic:

However, at the beginning of covid, the firm said that the last thing it would do would be to fire staff. So everyone feels blind sided and upset about the lack of transparency. Associate morale is pretty low.

The firm also is laying off essentially all of its secretarial staff, offering some the opportunity to transition to a “resource center coordinator” role and offering others small buyouts. Many of the secretaries have been at the firm for 20+ years. It is demoralizing.

It makes sense that morale would take a hit when so many employees suddenly find themselves out of work.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Lawyers Who Represent Smaller Players Should Sometimes Speak Less In Court
## 'Fill the room with your intelligence,' but not if it's going to cost your client a small fortune.

There is a common perception that many lawyers like the sound of their own voice and enjoy speaking in court and otherwise. Of course, lawyers are the type of people who like to argue, advocate, and make their voices heard, and attorneys are naturally more talkative than others. Sometimes, this can be helpful to serving a client since the more points a lawyer can make, the better a client may be served. However, lawyers often do not represent major parties in a case and do not have many meaningful things to add to a court conference or argument. In such instances, lawyers should usually take a backseat so that attorneys who have more skin in the game can be heard and judicial resources can be preserved.

I have encountered many attorneys who only represented minor parties in a case but who insisted on being heard on one point or another even though it did not have a major impact on a litigation. For instance, I was once involved in a lawsuit in which several notice defendants were named in the case. The notice defendants did not really participate in discovery, and they were not involved in many meetings and conferences that occurred during the litigation.

However, at every conference, the notice defendants made sure to speak up. They were involved in a litigation collateral to the one we were involved in, and they always wanted to bring the status of this collateral lawsuit to the attention of the court. Most of the time, it was not really important for the court to learn about the status of this other lawsuit, since the two litigations were proceeding almost independently. I could get a sense that the judge and some of the other parties were frustrated that the notice defendant was using so much of the conferences to talk about matters that were not really involved in our lawsuit.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Oral arguments are another time during which attorneys who represent minor parties might monopolize time that might be better used by bigger players in litigations. Often, courts will hear oral arguments for all of the motions submitted for the same motion cycle and will set a certain amount of time to hear all of the motions together. The more time that an attorney spends discussing minor matters means that lawyers who have more substantial matters to discuss cannot be heard on an issue.

For instance, one time I was arguing a motion for summary judgment along with another party to a case. One of the minor parties to the case was not involved in the summary judgment motions since that party did not have claims against it relating to the summary judgment motion. However, that party cross-moved for something relatively minor, so that issue was also going to be argued while we were arguing our summary judgment motions. This attorney spent so much time during that oral argument discussing the minor cross-motion even though the other parties have significant summary judgment motions to discuss. This was not the best use of resources, and the parties that had summary judgment motions to argue definitely wished that they had more time to make their points before time ran out for oral argument.

There are a number of disadvantages to lawyers representing minor clients spending an inordinate amount of time talking during court appearances. Perhaps most importantly, this can waste judicial resources. Judges are often extremely busy people who have numerous different tasks they need to perform on a countless number of files. By wasting a judge’s time by talking about minor matters related to a case, lawyers are taking judicial resources away from other matters that might need more consideration by the court.

Moreover, lawyers talking during conferences about minor issues involving minor parties can also waste counsel’s time as well. Lawyers usually handle dozens or more matters at once, and time is often in short supply. If lawyers need to attend a conference longer than normal because someone wants to be heard about a nonimportant issue, this takes time away that a lawyer could devote to other tasks. In addition, clients pay top dollar for a lawyer’s time, and often, numerous lawyers are working on a file. As a result, if a lawyer delays a conference for even a fraction of an hour unnecessarily, this could mean that clients need to pay thousands of dollars in legal fees to their counsel even though this could have been avoided.

All told, sometimes minor parties to a case need to be heard about a given legal issue, and sometimes lawyers who represent minor parties can present their arguments efficiently so they do not impose too much on the operations of a court. However, many times lawyers who represent minor parties should speak less in court to save the time and resources of judges, other lawyers, and everyone’s clients.

# The Pink Ghetto: Biglaw Sexual Harassment Stories Emerge In The Days Following The Harvey Weinstein Scandal
## It's disgusting when Biglaw partners behave like this and aren't punished.

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. While we’ve heard of countless tales of sexual harassment that have occurred in law firms across the country, this one is striking. Today, we’ll take a look at the ways law firm partners’ sexual harassment of young associates is reminiscent of the recent Harvey Weinstein scandal. This is a real email that we’ve received from a real reader.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law. We owe it to ourselves and to future generations of women in the law.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The Weinstein stories are reminding me in many ways of my days as a young associate at an old line “white shoe” law firm. I was in my 20s and well aware of my luck in getting such a plum job. In the 90s, there was no term for “sexual harrassment.”

At one point, I was assigned a deal with a corporate partner who was very powerful and respected. The power balance was him: 100, me: 0. We were closing a deal in Dallas, and I was instructed to meet him at a restaurant a 20 minute cab ride from our hotel. It was my first “real deal” and my first out-of-town trip with a partner. I got out of the cab and found myself in a busy parking lot with a lot of drunk guys in boots and cowboy hats acting rowdy. Inside the restaurant, I was introduced to the client and I had the feeling all through dinner that they had some kind of private joke about me — lots of winks and leering behavior.

After dinner, two girls came over and began to administer what I learned later were called “lap dances.” It was then that I realized I was the only fully clothed woman in the place. The dances became steamy and the two of them seemed to thoroughly enjoy my discomfort. I had never seen or heard of anything like that before. In my head I’m thinking: “At what point do I just get up and leave?” and “At some point do I just say enough?” and… “Is any job worth this?” But then, “Who would I tell? What would I SAY? Do I want this job?” My dad’s voice in my head told me I was of value, I had dignity, and at some point it IS enough! So I got up, said, “Gentlemen, I’ll be leaving you now,” and the world didn’t end.

I made my way through the parking lot of drunken cowboys and by some miracle, somehow found a cab to my hotel. Hours later, 3 a.m. or so, a knock at my room door. It was my partner asking to come in or, alternatively, asking me to come out for a drink. I said no politely, and the next day we closed as if nothing had occurred.

I never told my story because I was terrified of what would happen if I did. For years, I thought of mailing an anonymous letter to the firm’s HR or Exec Committee about it, but never did. I often wish I had just met with the head of the firm. I heard he became the head of corporate, but later that my partner had been forced out of the firm. He is at a different shop now, no doubt victimizing other young employees. To this day I feel horrible for any other young female associates who may have experienced unwanted attention — or worse — that my speaking out might have prevented.

I feel the pain, anger, and regret that some women in Hollywood have expressed over the Weinstein affair. All I can say is that behavior like that hurts a lot of people and their families. Hollywood is one field, but I think other industries like Biglaw, universities, investment banking, or financial services need to do some soul searching. Any organization with their own Harvey Weinsteins need to eject them, with extreme prejudice. And women need to speak up. I should have.

# Am Law 100 Firm Thrills With Gigantic Bonus Add-Ons For High Billers

Here we are, another week into December, and Biglaw associates are waiting on the edges of their seats to see if their firms will match the prevailing market rates for year-end and special bonuses. The latest firm to make a bonus announcement is a Silicon Valley powerhouse that came in at #82 on the latest Am Law 100 rankings, and it appears to be a straight Cravath match — except for very high billers that is. We’ll get to that exciting news later.

Here’s what the 2020 scale looks like at Fenwick & West, where bonuses are based on tier and level rather than class year:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Associates, counsel, and of counsel who met or exceeded 1,950 creditable hours (including billable client work, pro bono work, client service for the firm, and all other approved hours) will receive their full tier/level bonus. Note that counsel and of counsel are clearly included in these bonuses at Fenwick, whereas at other firms, attorneys with these titles are usually left in the dark about what their usually highly individualized bonuses will look like.

Let’s get to the awesome news for high billers at Fenwick. Those who spent the COVID crush doing billing, billing, and more billing at the firm — we’re talking those with over 2,300 creditable hours — will earn an extra $20,000. These additional bonuses are in lieu of the firm’s standard vacation condo program, which has been running for more than 30 years (but is currently on hiatus due to the pandemic). On top of that, the firm is offering high billers money to be used for getaways or toward rest, recreation, or relaxation as part of another decades-old rewards program: $3,000 for 2,100 creditable hours; $7,000 for 2,300 creditable hours; and $12,000 for 2,500 creditable hours. High billers at Fenwick with 2,300 hours or more could be walking away with an extra $27,000 to $32,000, over and above their year-end and special bonuses. This is a great way to reward the most dedicated of associates at the firm.

All bonuses at Fenwick will be paid out on December 18, 2020. Congratulations to all!

# CYA Attitudes Can Cost Clients Money
## Sometimes, clients and attorneys alike need to take steps purely so they will not get into too much trouble if something goes wrong down the line. But this can be costly.

The first time I ever heard the term CYA was when I was completing an Army ROTC program In Fort Knox, Kentucky. One of the drill sergeants told me that this stood for “cover your ass,” and sometimes you needed to perform certain tasks so you aren’t chewed out by a superior if things go south. Although this expression definitely applies to military life, it is also applicable to many industries, including the law. Sometimes, clients and attorneys alike need to take steps purely so they will not get into too much trouble if something goes wrong down the line. However, taking a CYA attitude too far can cost clients money in certain circumstances, and clients should reconsider some strategies they may take in order to shield themselves.

When I was an associate in Biglaw, I mostly worked on several multibillion-dollar lawsuits that were extremely important to the companies involved. Of course, if a business is engaged in a bet-the-company lawsuit, they are going to hire the best lawyers that they can, and they will not care too much about the cost. However, as an associate in Biglaw, I once had to handle a commercial lawsuit that was worth maybe a mid-five-figure sum. It seemed odd to me that a client would hire our law firm, which costs several times more than other shops, to handle this relatively small matter.

I asked the partner why he thought we had been hired for this matter, and he gave me two possible reasons. First, we had a good relationship with the client, so the client perhaps did not want to go hunting for different counsel for this matter with whom it did not have a strong connection. Second, the partner said that we might have been hired for CYA purposes. If the lawsuit went poorly, a higher-up might ask the in-house counsel about the matter. The in-house counsel could respond by saying that they hired a big firm with a proven track record so it was not the in-house counsel’s fault that the lawsuit went poorly for the company. However, if the in-house counsel hired a smaller firm that did not obtain a favorable result, it might be harder for the in-house lawyer to avoid scrutiny. Since big companies have deep pockets and layers of bureaucracy, the business and people who work for it might not be incentivized to save money and might be more incentivized to insulate themselves from liability.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Sometimes when clients take CYA attitudes with the selection of counsel, not only might it cost them additional money in attorneys’ fees, but it can also make it more difficult for them to win a case. Since higher-paid lawyers might easily consume litigation budgets, there might not be enough money remaining for expert reports, private investigators, and all of the other services that might be needed to win a case. However, clients who spend less money on counsel might have additional options that can give them a solid footing in litigation, and this can even give them the upper hand when matched against a larger law firm.

One time, I was at a firm that represented a plaintiff in a run-of-the-mill breach of contract matter. The case was definitely a five-figure matter, and the issues were not too complicated. This definitely was not a bet-the-company lawsuit for either of the parties involved in the dispute. To our surprise, the defendant hired a massive law firm that likely charged several times more than us to handle the defense. Some at the firm were nervous about the implications of this larger firm being hired to defend the case, but I figured that this might be to our advantage.

Since the larger law firm was charging an arm and a legal for legal services, it soon became apparent that, before long, the defendant would probably spend more money on legal fees defending the case than settling the matter. Even though the defendant had solid defenses, and the prevailing party was entitled to attorneys’ fees, this party soon realized that a settlement was its best options given the expenses that the party would face. Of course, I have no idea why the defendant chose a massive law firm to defend it in that matter. Perhaps it was because they had relationships with this law firm and did not want to forge connections with new counsel. But if the decision to use this law firm was based on a CYA attitude, that strategy might have cost the party money in the long run.

All told, sometimes it is good for clients to make CYA a big part of their strategies since larger lawsuits and other types of matters require seasoned counsel that might charge more money. However, in some instances, CYA attitudes can cost clients money in the long run.

## Haphazard ranking serves as a reminder that service hasn't quite found the right formula after law schools started withdrawing their data.

The full U.S. News & World Report law school rankings are out and they are… [something](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-2024-2025-u-s-news-law-school-rankings-are-here/). Duke is tied with Harvard? NYU nearly drops out of the top 10? Are we just hurling darts at a dartboard here? In a sense, [yes](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/law-schools-dropping-out-of-us-news-rankings/). At least ever since law schools started [withdrawing their cooperation](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/yale-law-school-pulls-out-of-u-s-news-rankings-like-michael-jordan-skipping-slam-dunk-contest/). Meanwhile, a Biglaw firm tried to promote healthy sleep [despite being the primary reason associates don’t sleep](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/simpson-thachers-gift-to-associates-goes-over-like-a-lead-balloon/) and Trump’s bond in the NY civil fraud case [looks a little suspect](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/trump-ny-bond-just-as-kosher-as-his-financial-statements/).

# Simplifying The Complex In Patent Cases
## The complexity only gets more challenging when damages are present in a patent case.

Part of the fun in trying patent cases to a jury is the fact that there are three big issues that need addressing as part of a complete verdict. But addressing those issues in a coherent and cohesive way is also the greatest hurdle for patent trial lawyers to clear. As a result, the mark of a great patent trial lawyer is the ability to make complex concepts understandable to those less familiar with the specifics of a given case. As I explain to investors when I try to help them handicap ongoing patent litigation, each one of those three cardinal patent issues — infringement, validity, and damages —  requires serious analysis, in even the simplest patent case. When you add in that infringement and validity are issues that are intertwined in their dependence on claim construction, things get even more complicated for the lay observer. Making things worse is that in district court both the burdens and standards of proof are different on those issues, with the plaintiff bearing the burden of proving infringement by a preponderance of the evidence and the defendant having to prove invalidity by clear and convincing evidence. It is a lot, even for the highly educated and smart analysts that are expected to be found at some of the world’s most sophisticated investment firms.

The complexity only gets more challenging when damages are present in a patent case. Just take a look at even the simplest pre-trial Daubert decision on patent damages. Even financial professionals with the ability to analyze complex financial statements and projections for the publicly traded companies they invest in find patent damages complex. I can sense them start to fidget on the phone as I explain that even the simplest reasonable royalty calculation in a patent case involves both a hypothetical negotiation — in and of itself a difficult construct to work with — as well as a 15-factor analysis in order to try to approximate what would have happened during the imaginary negotiation. Throw in case-specific damages issues like lost profits, noninfringing alternatives, and the like, and it is clear that damages is another issue in patent cases where the complexity can be overwhelming, even for sophisticated jurists asked to perform the gatekeeper role demanded by Daubert pre-trial.

A recent decision out of Delaware’s District Court confirms that judges understand the complexity of patent cases — and take seriously their responsibility as gatekeepers, in terms of making the job of a jury in a patent case a workable endeavor. On August 8, 2023, Delaware’s Judge Christopher J. Burke entered an order in Hilti Aktiengesellschaft v. Specified Technologies, Inc. (D. Del. Case No: 1-22-cv-01248) granting the defendant’s motion to sever claims from one patent case pending against them so that those severed claims could be consolidated in a second pending patent action.

In particular, Burke agreed with the defendant that a set of three patents in the first case should be severed, as “multiple factors weigh in favor of severance of claims regarding” those patents. Chief among those factors was the “overly complex” nature of the first pending case, which prior to severance involved “11 patents in total (including two asserted by Defendant), five different patent families, and five different categories of accused products.” Seeking to spare the jury the “herculean task” of sorting through that morass was vital, as “even a substantial reduction in the number of asserted claims would not save the jury from an incredibly complicated undertaking.” As the court recognized, not only are juries charged to “learn the ins and outs of a large number of patent families and multiple accused products, all with different features,” they are challenged to do so at the same time as they are forced to “grapple with the complexities of patent law.” To make things easier, in both cases, the court found that severance of at least three of the asserted patents — which were all related — was appropriate.

At the same time, the court was quick to acknowledge that even post-severance and consolidation the two reconfigured proceedings would still be challenging for their respective juries to resolve. (We can set aside for now the evergreen debate on whether specific patent trial courts are needed or whether patent juries are even capable of getting to a proper decision in any given patent case.) What mattered to the court was that the juries in each case be given the opportunity to conduct “meaningful” deliberations, based on the trial presentations that were made to each set of jurors by the parties.

Also counseling in favor of severance was that the set of severed patents differed in substantive ways from the patents remaining in the case. For example, they involved different accused products and had no overlapping inventors. In contrast, the patent asserted in the second case shared “the same title, claimed priority date, and named inventors” as the severed patents. Accordingly, the court found that consolidating the severed patents into that second case made “good sense” and would streamline both cases going forward.

Ultimately, this decision highlights the sensitivity of experienced patent jurists to the needs of juries asked to act as fact finders in patent cases. As even the simplest patent case can present manifold complexities, any assistance from the court — and the parties — in alleviating the burden placed on juries helps allow those juries to do their jobs properly. Better handling of issues presented to juries helps to reduce appeal risk and can lead to increased confidence in the legal system for litigants and the general public. At the same time, we all know that one of the best ways to increase the pressure on an accused infringer is to assert a diversified set of patents, ideally against a range of accused products. For now, we can focus on how at least one court decided to simplify the complex. Down the road, we can talk about how patent litigants often try to make the complex even more complex.

# Former Biglaw Partner Gets 2-Year Suspension For Falsifying Documents
## Eventually his web of deception was discovered.

Adam Wiensch

Former Foley & Lardner partner Adam Wiensch was suspended by the Wisconsin Supreme Court for two years for falsifying and backdating IRS documents, and causing other lawyers at the Biglaw firm to rely on those documents. According to the decision from the Wisconsin high court, the deception went on for a number of years until the web was eventually torn apart as pressure from an IRS audit mounted.

At the time of the incidents in question, Wiensch worked in Foley & Lardner’s trusts and estates department, representing a husband and wife who owed a private business. As part of that representation, Wiensch was charged with creating a trust for the benefit of his clients’ children and transferring more than $50 million of stock from their company to the trust. When his clients passed away, it triggered an IRS audit.[ According to](https://www.law.com/2018/10/16/two-year-suspension-for-ex-foley-partner-over-estate-document-tampering/) Law.com, that’s when things really got interesting:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Responding to inquiries from an IRS lawyer in 2012, Wiensch provided the agency with copies of documents—an installment sale agreement, a collateral pledge agreement and a guaranty of a specific transaction—that he claimed memorialized the terms of the stock sale. Wiensch characterized the documents as having been created at the same time as the stock transfer, but that turned out to be untrue, according to the ruling. The lawyer had backdated the sale agreement and had copied the children’s signatures from another document and pasted them onto the guaranty document.

After both the husband and wife had died, the IRS issued a notice that the children owed “multiple millions of dollars” in taxes and penalties in connection with the stock sale. Foley & Lardner then represented the children and, without knowing Wiensch had falsified them, firm lawyers used some of the documents to support an argument for reducing the tax burden. The estate and IRS later reached a settlement, which the Wisconsin Supreme Court wrote was “induced by fraud,” because it was based on the doctored agreements.

But Wiensch’s questionable behavior didn’t stop there. In 2015, he also falsified power of attorney documents related to the wife’s estate. These doctored documents aroused the IRS’s suspicions and by mid-2016 they sought additional information. Around the same time, Foley & Larder also figured out something was fishy. They fired Wiensch and informed the authorities about the irregularities.

Foley & Lardner spokesperson Jill Chanen said:

“We have zero tolerance for actions that violate our core values and the trust our clients place in us,” Chanen said. “Upon becoming aware of irregularities, the firm promptly launched an internal review. It was determined that conduct occurred which needed to be reported to the appropriate authorities and the firm cooperated with them. The partner is no longer affiliated with the firm. We will continue to hold all of our people to the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct.”

# How to Be Your Best Advocate: Insights From a Recruiter About the Gender Pay Gap
## Your previous experience should be a springboard, not a limitation.

Here’s the scene that plays out in my office over and over:  two associates come in for a one-on-one meeting. Their credentials and accomplishments are identical – the only difference is their gender, one associate is male and the other associate is female.

From the start, the meeting with the male associate takes on a different tone than the meeting with the female associate.  The male associate sits across the table from me and describes his practice and experience while tactfully highlighting his achievements.  He’s evaluated his skillset and thought through the unique value that he brings to the partners for whom he works and the clients that his team services.  He has formulated a vision for the road ahead for his career (partner at a top firm, a position with the United States Attorney’s Office, GC at a Fortune 100 company or PE backed portfolio company, etc.).  He’s already started to map out the steps he’ll need to take to get there. He uses the meeting as an opportunity to solicit my opinion and begins to incorporate my advice into a plan of action to help him achieve his goals.  He is confident and proud of his success, and I can clearly see that he’ll inspire confidence whenever he pitches himself.

My next meeting is with an equally impressive and accomplished female associate. Rather than clearly articulating her expertise, value and long-term goals on her own, I routinely find that I have to draw her experiences out with probing and leading questions. Our meeting is not a discussion of how to help her accomplish her goals, but rather a conversation about how to frame those experiences and understand the value that she brings to her current team as well as to potential employers.  Often it takes convincing for me to show her what I see in her and the value I think that she will bring to future employers.

In our recently released [Partner Compensation Survey](http://bit.ly/2Ux9seZ), we found that male law firm partners earn 53% more than their female counterparts, and significantly outpace female partners in originations and billing rates.  As dismal as that sounds for women in the profession, a deep analysis of the data revealed a bright silver lining for women: the data does not suggest that there is a conscious bias against women attorneys.  What it did show is that the vast majority (75%) of the variation in compensation among partners is accounted for by originations. The gap can start as early in a career as the scenario described above. But it also means there’s an opportunity to make necessary changes.

In my interactions with young associates, I find that men often lead with confidence. Their previous experience is not a limitation, but rather a springboard that they use to propel their skillsets even further.  Women, on the other hand, often downplay their accomplishments and focus on the experiences they haven’t had. They don’t see the importance in some of their unique accomplishments, writing them off as being part of the job rather than being a standout differentiator.  Despite their success, intelligence, and plethora of amazing qualities, women often deemphasize their accomplishments and focus on what they have yet to do.

We see this time and again – understated women, limiting the discussion about their skill set to what they have already mastered and proven. This is contrasted with men who project the confidence of being primed and ready to achieve the next level of practice.  After thirteen years as a legal recruiter, I can tell you that this is a big deal in the interview process. The way in which associates package themselves and their experiences has a big effect on the outcome of an interview. If it’s a big deal in the interview process, it’s an even bigger deal in the workplace engendering the confidence of senior associates, partners, clients and even peers.  So what can women do?

Be Aware of this Phenomena

The first step is awareness. I often reveal to female candidates how I see men conducting themselves through the interview process – right down to letting women know what men are asking for in the compensation negotiation process.  You should not feel guilty for asking what you feel you are entitled to. I often tell women that “my male candidates don’t weigh themselves down with that guilt.”

Determine Your Strengths and Successes

Look back and consider everything that you’ve achieved in your career and write it down.  Chances are that you have gained some impressive experience that is worth touting. As you’re going through that exercise, think about how you’d coach a colleague to frame and package their achievements and give yourself the same advice.  Keep a running list so that as your career progresses, you can keep an ongoing tally. Save emails and positive feedback to look back on later. You need to acknowledge abilities, and having a list to reference will help keep them top of mind.

Develop Your Elevator Pitch

Once you have an idea of your strengths and accomplishments, consider how you should convey that information.  Whether it’s in an interview or an everyday conversation, think about how you would describe yourself and your career to someone in 30 seconds.  How you frame your experience should encapsulate your strengths and demonstrate the value that you bring to your practice. Developing this elevator pitch will be the start of changing the way you present yourself.  When you get in the mindset of speaking positively about yourself, it will become a habit. These small changes will pay dividends as your progress in your career.

# Vault 100 Rankings: The Most Prestigious Law Firms In America (2018)
## Money matters when it comes to ranking prestige in Biglaw.

What do associates at major law firms care about more than money? Prestige, of course. But, at the end of the day, sometimes being a leader when it comes to compensation is enough to boost a firm’s prestige. As luck would have it, the closely watched Vault 100 rankings are here to remind lawyers at the nation’s largest law firms about exactly which ones are considered the most prestigious.

In last year’s Vault 100 rankings, Cravath — the firm that rocked the associate salary scale last summer — elbowed Wachtell Lipton out of its 13-year reign in the number 1 slot, thanks to a survey that closed before Cravath’s new $180K salary scale was even announced. Was Cravath able to retain its position as the most prestigious Biglaw firm in the country in the latest Vault rankings?

Absolutely! Here’s what Matt Moody, Vault’s senior law editor, had to say about Cravath’s placement in the latest rankings: “After just edging out Wachtell last year, Cravath really solidified its top spot this year. Cravath invented the business model upon which nearly all large law firms are organized. And associates clearly haven’t forgotten that the firm is responsible for industry-wide associate raises last year.” While Cravath increased its prestige score from 8.961 to 9.056, Wachtell saw its prestige score drop from 8.904 to 8.788. In fact, one survey respondent’s comment made clear why Cravath is now considered the post prestigious firm of all: “Thank God for the Cravath pay scale!”

Although Cravath and Wachtell kept their first- and second-place spots in the latest edition of the Vault rankings, there was some movement at the tail end of the Top 10. Without any further ado, here are the Top 10 Most Prestigious Law Firms based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2018:

- [Cravath, Swaine & Moore](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/cravath,-swaine-moore-llp/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/wachtell-lipton-rosen-katz/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/skadden,-arps,-slate,-meagher-flom-llp-and-affiliates/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Sullivan & Cromwell](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/sullivan-cromwell-llp/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Davis Polk & Wardwell](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/davis-polk-wardwell/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Simpson Thacher & Bartlett](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/simpson-thacher-bartlett-llp/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Latham & Watkins](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/latham-watkins-llp/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Kirkland & Ellis](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/kirkland-ellis-llp/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/gibson-dunn-crutcher-llp/company-overview.aspx) (+1)
- [Weil, Gotshal & Manges](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/weil,-gotshal-manges-llp/company-overview.aspx) (+1)
You may be wondering where Cleary Gottlieb landed after falling out of the Top 10. Last year, the firm was perched in the number 9 slot, but this year, the firm fell three spots to to number 12. Better luck next time, Cleary.

There were also noteworthy moves outside of the Top 10. Three firms dropped out of the Top 100 entirely, and thanks to some major merger activity, five firms edged their way back in. Two spots opened due in part to the Arnold & Porter and Kaye Scholer merger (the combined firm is now known as [Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/arnold-porter-llp/company-overview.aspx), and is ranked at No. 29) and the recently announced [Norton Rose Fulbright](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/norton-rose-fulbright/company-overview.aspx) and Chadbourne & Parke merger (although the combination is not yet complete, the resultant firm has been ranked at No. 68).

# Law Firm Talent Competition Will Hinge On Firms’ Ability To Help Lawyers Work Smarter, Not Harder
## Improvements to the traditional law firm workflow and culture – more than salary hikes or signing bonuses alone – will drive sustainable law firm growth in the post-pandemic economy.

America’s law firms have not been immune from the disruptive forces of the Great Resignation. [Roughly 33 million](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSQUL?utm_source=npr_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=20220122&utm_term=6236291&utm_campaign=money&utm_id=1253516&orgid=278&utm_att1=nprnews) Americans quit their jobs between spring and the end of 2021 as the twin forces of pandemic and career burnout caused many to rethink their careers. Law firm associate turnover rose to record levels, with 23.2% of associates leaving their firms as of November 2021, according to the [2022 State of the Legal Market Report](https://tmsnrt.rs/32QYDy8) from Thomson Reuters and Georgetown Law. Many firms have responded by [raising starting salaries](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/attorney-recruitment-fears-temper-law-firms-bullish-outlook-2021-11-16/) and offering signing bonuses. In fact, salaries have now climbed so high that the report concludes that lawyer recruitment and retention is now the greatest risk to law firm profitability.

A new report –[ Law Firms Competing for Talent in 2022: Will Lawyers Stay or Will They Go? ](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/law-firms-stay-go-report-2022?cid=9061230&chl=pr&sfdccampaignid=PR)– found that compensation and workloads are not the key factors driving lawyers’ decisions whether to leave their current firm and join a different firm. Associates who expressed a preference to stay at their current firms said they value things like the people they work with, their firm’s culture, the quality of work they do, having a clear path for advancing their career, and flexible working practices.

The importance of that last point cannot be overstated. Our [research shows ](https://bit.ly/2021standout2)that one of the biggest sources of frustration for lawyers is not necessarily the number of hours they’re working, but a lack of flexibility in how, when and where they work those hours, with many expressing a strong desire for more remote or hybrid working.

Long Live the Flexible Workweek

We’ve been tracking trends in law firm performance, lawyer productivity and employee satisfaction for decades, and while lawyers have always sought some degree of flexibility and work-life balance, the changes that have occurred over the past two years have been significant in terms of the mixed signals they’ve sent. It’s not as simple as the headlines would suggest. Yes, lawyer turnover has risen to record levels, but there is no mass exodus of lawyers cashing in their retirement plans. And not everyone is quitting in frustration after working around the clock on a never-ending stream of video conferences.

The truth is somewhere in the middle where after successfully working through the last two years of disruption and uncertainty, many lawyers have developed a new-found appreciation for the new working rhythms that have emerged through the chaos.

What we’re seeing as we continue to speak with lawyers and dig into the data is that satisfaction is not merely about compensation or the total number of hours worked, but also factors such as having flexibility in work arrangements to allow those hours to be logged outside the traditional boundaries of the workweek spent in the office. As a case in point, the number of lawyers who say they want more flexibility in their hours has nearly doubled since the start of the pandemic, and the average number of days they want to work remotely has tripled.

Culture, Clarity, Control, and Support

While many news reports have characterized this trend as a major challenge for law firms, it’s also a significant opportunity. Lawyers at firms with lower turnover tend to be happier and more productive in their work and are more satisfied with firm management, the level of support they receive, and opportunities for growth. Many lawyers are reevaluating their careers and keeping their eyes open for a better opportunity, and firms that crack the code on delivering the right mix of culture, flexibility and career path stand to benefit enormously from the trend.

Part of that success formula will come from remote or hybrid work. A[ solid majority](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/stellar-performance-2021/) (60%) of law firm lawyers now say that working remotely has positively impacted their well-being. But simply giving lawyers a laptop and telling them they can work from home a couple of days a week is not enough. Firms that have gotten remote work right are giving associates and partners the clarity, control, and support they need to thrive in the new world of fluid transition between home and office, and work and non-work hours.

Increasingly, that’s requiring innovation on the part of law firms in the way they communicate with their lawyers and in the tools they provide them to stay connected outside the traditional boundaries of time and place. Firms need to clearly articulate their expectations, broader vision, and priorities more frequently in a remote or hybrid environment. That steady cadence of communication is essential to maintaining an attractive firm culture in an environment where the traditional, location-based hallmarks of office life are less apparent.

Equally important, firms need to show they are committed to their post-pandemic workforces by giving them the tools and technology they need to be just as effective from home as they were from their offices. These include productivity management and collaboration tools that let them access information, partner with remote teams and interface with clients seamlessly. Lawyers at firms with higher levels of retention are more likely to view themselves as early adopters or innovators of technology, and view collaborative and knowledge management technologies as helpful; and they appreciate their firms providing these tools to support them.

Ultimately, law firms that want to stay competitive in this rapidly evolving marketplace need to prove to their lawyers and prospects how they are helping them work smarter, not harder, by deploying technology, committing to higher order values, and helping their lawyers feel supported in their work and career. In the long run, these improvements to the traditional law firm workflow and culture – more than salary hikes or signing bonuses alone – will drive sustainable law firm growth in the post-pandemic economy.

This is how it worked in my grandpappy’s day and there ain’t nothin’ wrong with it!

This may seem obvious, but you probably need your clients to like you. Maybe not personally, but it is really imperative to running a law practice that your clients should respect your area of expertise and think you are on the cutting edge of your field — well, if you want to keep your client, at least.

But according to a recent survey of 300 in-house counsel conducted by the BTI Consulting Group, a majority of general counsel believe that the law firms they work with are stuck in the past. As Law360 [reports](http://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/822492):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
56.5 percent [of survey respondents are] reporting their firms are in a rut. Some firms try but fall short, some fail to communicate their changes to clients, and some simply don’t see the need.

Danger Will Robinson!

Though the percentage of GCs that also believe law firms are moving toward change has increased significantly since 2010 (43.5 percent versus 24.5 percent), it still isn’t inspiring for the profession that so many are stagnant. And though the increase in flexibility is definitely good, I imagine a good deal of those changes were caused by the radical shift in the market caused by the Great Recession. I can’t imagine how bad the market would have to get to get the rest of these firms on board with modernity.

BTI also dug deeper into the makeup of the unchanging firms, and categorized them into three primary types:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In BTI’s interviews with corporate counsel, it emerged that stagnant law firms tend to fall into one of three categories.

There are the Mercenaries, whose only noticeable change is higher rates.

Sounds about right, have to [fund those raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/some-clients-are-super-pissed-about-associate-raises/), dontcha see? But seriously, unless the robot devil in all his silver-tongued greatness was himself handling your bet-the-company case, I cannot imagine why you would stick with a firm like this.

Most law firms, however, are either the Talkers or the Oppositional, according to BTI. Talkers may bloviate about change, but it never seems to actually happen. That drives clients crazy and leaves them wondering why firms would even bring up intended changes they don’t intend to deliver on, [BTI President and founder Michael] Rynowecer said.

I promise baby, this time will be different. I’ve changed, really I have.

Oppositional firms just don’t seem to care — when clients suggest or request a change, they’re uninterested, dismissive or reluctant. They avoid alternative fee arrangements and some of them still tell GCs that their requests are counterproductive. Rynowecer said the oppositionals tend to believe their process and approach are superb and they’re delivering excellent client service, but their clients see them as inflexible and unwilling to listen.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The best offense is… more offense? I’m pretty sure that isn’t how the saying goes, but don’t tell that to these out-of-touch law firms. It would spoil their carefully crafted delusion.

The takeaway from this survey — for all firms, even if you think you are willing to change — is to take a hard look at your best practices and see if they are adequately meeting your clients’ needs:

“There is at least a 50-50 chance that clients think you’re stuck in the past and you don’t realize it,” Rynowecer said. “And the cost of being there is very high.”

# What Should You Do If Your Biglaw Firm Is Making Class-Year Adjustments Among Associates?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Several firms are holding people back or asking them to go down a [class] year. My advice to international associates or those retooling when joining a firm is generally to always take a class year reduction if it’s offered because you want to be performing at the top of your year. But that is difficult to accept when you have six offers and some are at higher class years. A class year or two can mean a huge difference in salary.

— David Nicol, a partner and owner at legal recruiting firm Marsden, in comments given to [The Recorder](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2023/04/24/class-year-adjustments-underscore-lingering-skills-gap-among-associates/) on what associates should do if they’re asked to go down a class year within their firms. Another recruiter who spoke anonymously on class-year adjustments said that “people in that type of situation have been impacted by reductions or are being put on a performance plan and potentially being papered for a future reduction.”

# The Biglaw Bill Taking Center Stage At The Second Manafort Trial
## Skadden continues to play a big role in the Mueller investigation -- though probably not one they want.

Oh, the legal troubles for Paul Manafort are far from over. Not only is he facing up to 80 years in prison for 8 counts he was convicted of in a Virginia federal court, he is facing a separate trial in D.C. for a slew of new charges.

In this second trial, scheduled to start September 17th, Manafort faces a variety of charges including conspiracy to launder money, tampering with and conspiring to tamper with witnesses, failure to disclose foreign lobbying work and making false Foreign Agents Registration Act statements. Central to many of these claims is the work Manafort did on behalf of the Ukrainian government — work he hired Biglaw firm Skadden Arps to do.

According to the indictment, Manafort hired a law firm (known to be Skadden) to write a memo justifying the prosecution of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s political rivals. As Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/2018/08/27/manaforts-skadden-ties-ukraine-work-likely-under-spotlight-in-dc-trial/), the government is following the money used for that legal work:

Manafort allegedly used at least $4 million from an offshore account to pay Skadden for the report. They also paid $1 million to one of the public relations companies to “create and implement a roll-out plan for the report,” as Manafort and his longtime business associate Rick Gates sought to sway public opinion of Viktor Yanukovych, the former prime minister.

Now we know, thanks to the government’s proposed evidence list, that 2012 and 2013 invoices from Skadden, as well as communications between Manafort and [former](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/amid-mueller-probe-prominent-skadden-counsel-disappears-from-website/) Skadden counsel Greg Craig and  Skadden partner Ken Gross are anticipated to play a role in the trial. Along with 2,000 other potential trial exhibits.

A (now former) Skadden associate, Alex van der Zwaan, has [already pleaded guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/former-skadden-associate-who-pleaded-guilty-in-mueller-probe-begs-for-no-jail-time/) to lying to investigators in the Mueller probe. And the [case against former counsel Craig](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/skadden-counsel-tagged-in-mueller-probe/) for potentially acting as an unregistered lobbyist, has been referred to the S.D.N.Y.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# The Dreaded Stealth Layoff Rears Its Ugly Head

It’s pretty clear the economic impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic is pretty bad. Biglaw’s been reeling — instituting salary cuts, reductions in partner draws, furloughs, and even layoffs to maintain their cash flow to weather the coronavirus storm. But beyond the prudent financial decisions most in Biglaw are willing to admit to, there are whispers and rumors that more is going on.

That’s right, it looks like [stealth layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/stealth-layoffs/?rf=1) are coming back to Biglaw. Made popular during the 2009 recession, firms often feel it is a way to save face and cut costs at the same time. But while what we’re hearing is still in the rumor stage, Above the Law thought it best to give everyone a refresher on the insidious nature of stealth layoffs to help you spot it when it happens at your firm.

What are stealth layoffs:

Due to their, well, stealthy nature, they’re a little hard to define. But basically it’s when a firm wants to cut headcount but doesn’t want blowback from announcing actual layoffs. So, they’ll give the associates X number of months/weeks to find a new job and the firm may even couch the reductions in performance review terms, making those let go doubt their lawyering skills.

When are they used:

Well, pretty much all the time. But they’re the most prevalent during economic downturns. Rather than signal some perceived weakness, a firm tries to cut overhead without making a splash.

Why are they awful:

It’s not us, it’s you. That’s the message of the stealth layoff. Often the attorneys who find themselves suddenly out of work have not previously had a negative performance review. Despite that history, the firm decided they were the chaff that needed to be cut, never mind that in robust economic times they’d continue to receive good performance reviews.

Are firms using stealth layoffs now:

If the ATL tips line is anything to go by, hell yes. Some firms, in assuring associates that purely economic layoffs were not forthcoming, seemed to signal that headcount reductions in guise of performance review were on the table.

But the challenge is confirming exactly where they’re happening. The firm’s go to media response is that there are no economic-based layoffs (because they believe the line that they’re only letting go of associates because of performance issues). And by refusing to acknowledge to the fired attorneys that economics beyond their control are fueling the employment decision, they’re creating a sense of shame the firms depend on to keep news of their stealth layoffs from circulating. No one wants to tell the world they were fired for being a crappy attorney and that’s what firms are depending on when they feed that fiction.

So, please keep Above the Law in mind when attorneys are suddenly let go and the firm insists there’ve been no layoffs. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Stealth%20Layoffs) or text us (646-820-8477). Even if we are unable to verify the move, we are listening.

# Oops (Britney Spears's Dad) Did It Again!
## After getting called out in filings for harassing Britney with discovery requests, Jamie Spears is now trying to force Britney into a deposition.

How is this case still happening?

After years of effort, the courts [freed Britney Spears from her conservatorship late last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/britney-spears-is-free/). I know it sounds a little hard to believe in June of 2022, but a court actually decided that an adult woman could have full control over her own life less than a year ago.

But her dad is still [fighting?](https://www.tmz.com/2022/06/29/britney-spears-jamie-spears-deposition-shameless-lawyer/)

Britney Spears is not going to sit willingly for a deposition … that was made clear by her lawyer, who filed legal docs saying Jamie Spears is “shameless” by, among other things, asking a judge for a depo date “shortly after his daughter’s wedding and just before Father’s Day.”

Attorney Mathew Rosengart claims in searing legal docs … “Mr. Spears refuses to simply go away, as he should and as any decent man or father would do.” Rosengart goes on to say Jamie is piling up legal fees to rehabilitate his reputation.

Past filings alleged that the Jamie Spears legal team from Willkie Farr was “[harassing and bullying](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/leave-britney-alone-biglaw-partner-says-britney-spears-is-being-bullied-and-harassed-by-her-fathers-new-lawyer/)” Britney with document requests. This seems to be another chapter in that campaign to break Britney’s resolve through attrition.

[UPDATE: Here’s the [latest filing from Britney](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/06/Opp-to-MTC-Britney-Depo.pdf). It notes that the allegations against Jamie Spears are based on third party evidence rendering any Britney deposition irrelevant at this juncture, which should prove fatal to the request… but it also includes this fun fact which is WILD…

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
He has repeatedly professed to “love” his daughter—and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a press tour trying to convince the public of this, for which he billed Britney Spears’s Estate, for so-called “Media Matters”

“Media Matters” is apparently the “further work” of the conservatorship world.’

With the conservatorship over, all that remains are Britney’s claims for an accounting of unjustified payments she claims her dad made despite gross conflicts of interest. That should’ve been a pretty straightforward affair and frankly one that Jamie Spears would be wise to settle and walk away.

Instead he’s been [avoiding a deposition](https://www.tmz.com/2021/11/02/britney-spears-lawyer-jamie-spears-bedroom-listening-device/) and then raised the stakes by trying to make Britney sit for a deposition. It’s not clear how her testimony is relevant to the question of “did Papa Spears have a conflict of interest?” and Greenberg Traurig’s Rosengart agrees, branding the request “morally abominable” and “revenge.”

The push-pull of the legal relationship is always balancing the obligation to serve the client’s wishes and the obligation to serve the client… in spite of those wishes. Some lawyer really needs to tell Jamie Spears that his best hope of improving his reputation right now is to fade into the background. Because scorched earth discovery games when you’ve already lost months ago may satisfy the client ego and rack up fees but they aren’t going to do much for his public persona.

Ron Friedmann

This was a fun interview!

This week I sat down with [Ron Friedmann](http://prismlegal.com/ron-friedmann-resume/), NYU-trained lawyer turned legal consultant, who has more personal experience in the traditional legal market and alt.legal market than anyone I have met. Today, Ron leverages that experience to advise law firms and corporate legal counsel on how they can innovate, deliver value, and grow during this period of massive technological and market change.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
While I suggest that anyone who is interested in alternative careers in the law should take a look at his [bio](http://www.firemanco.com/about-us/) (and call him!), I’ll summarize the highlights: summer associate in Biglaw; litigation and practice support at WilmerHale; C-Suite officer at Mintz Levin; VP at legal outsourcing company, [Integreon](http://www.integreon.com/DefaultHome); and, today, a widely known partner at the prestigious legal consultancy, [Fireman & Company](http://www.firemanco.com/).

We covered a lot of ground in our chat, so read on for Ron’s take on: (1) the dangerous artificial divide between lawyers and other professionals at law firms (the “caste system”); (2) how law firms can attract business in a “flat” market for legal services; and (3) how Biglaw can get in the alt.legal game, or at least join the party through partnerships. Enjoy!

Joe Borstein: Ron, you’ve witnessed firsthand all sides of the legal ecosystem, so I have many questions, but let’s start with the low-hanging fruit. If you could convince a Biglaw firm to change one thing, what would it be (and why can’t they see it on their own)?

Ron Friedmann: The one biggest and hardest thing I would change is the caste system. The artificial divide between lawyers, other professionals and staff has long had pernicious effects. Certainly those in law firms on the wrong side of the divide suffer. Clients also suffer because lawyers alone cannot deliver the value clients demand.

Today, large firms should want to do away with the caste system. Here’s why… Biglaw is still adjusting to a flat market. In a flat market, firms must battle for share of market and wallet. Clients assume good legal outcomes. To gain share, firms need to do better than competition. Absent a unique market position, which only a handful of firms have, the only sustainable way to be better is via improved service delivery.

Better service delivery includes legal project management, better use of technology and knowledge management. Better service delivery reduces cost to client and improves profits for firms. Law firms must change their staffing mix to achieve better service delivery. That includes hiring pricing professionals, project managers, knowledge managers, and others who can work at the intersection of law practice, business and tech. This creates opportunities for JDs who do not want to practice and for other professionals.

Joe Borstein: You mention that it has been a “flat market” for law firms, and that in such a market, firms must battle for share of market and wallet. My question is do you think that flat market is here to stay? If so, do you think that alt.legal businesses can help law firms tap new demand and help them serve pockets of demand that are currently being left behind?

Ron Friedmann: Yes, all evidence points to a flat market – at least for large law firms.

The demand for corporate legal services, however, continues to grow. The rise of alternatives to large firms explains the disconnect between growing demand and a flat market. Players other than law firms fulfill the growing demand: law departments continue to bring work in-house and rely on alternative service providers. The alternatives include managed legal services, legal process outsourcing (LPO), boutique law firms, and a range of staffing providers.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Biglaw can tap the alt.legal demand. But will they? Tapping that demand means moving away from the traditions of billable hours and partners and associates. Firms can – and some indeed do – hire lawyers not on the partnership track. These lawyers, often called staff attorneys, bill at rates sometimes significantly lower than associates. The Citi 2015 Law Firm Leaders Survey found that 71 percent of law firms expect this type of position to grow. Growing the ranks of such lawyers – and then managing them effectively – can help firms compete with lower-cost providers.

Some law firms also now tap the alt.legal market with technology. As I noted in my recent blog post [Automating Legal Advice: AI and Expert Systems](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__prismlegal.com_automating-2Dlegal-2Dadvice-2Dai-2Dand-2Dexpert-2Dsystems_&d=CwMFaQ&c=4ZIZThykDLcoWk-GVjSLm9hvvvzvGv0FLoWSRuCSs5Q&r=JKLJue51C3qGeSHasAlx25mRGgNNjd4KgihAOdZ4s7k&m=kx15kvAxlsbGmaVr_TkcT2asNZeVGiGEiFuvG0rW5cU&s=cW8OKPGBPLyuB254eRlijCsXUJoIpd019xfWECYZxZ8&e=), more firms now offer expert systems that serve clients via web-based Q&A. It’s hard to say right now though how big a trend this is. Separately, I have long wondered why law firms do not compete with managed legal service providers on contract management. I think they could, but doing so means difficult changes to the business model.

Firms recognizing that much of their work is not rocket science and is relatively routine are best positioned to pursue alt.legal – if they can adjust their business models.

Joe Borstein: Interesting. I would agree that most Biglaw firms don’t want to start their own alt.legal divisions or subsidiaries, but what about partnering with alternative providers? Could that allow firms to unlock demand without changing their model? Is there appetite for that?

Ron Friedmann: Law firms can partner with an alternative provider to build lower cost and better service delivery. I see two obvious paths: with an LPO / managed services provider or with a staffing company.

Since 2007, I count a dozen large law firms (in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Australia) that have publicly discussed relationships with legal process outsourcing providers. And I know there are quite a few unannounced partnerships with managed legal services providers. Given the perceived sensitivity around the topic, however, gauging the impact of these to date has been hard.

The advantage of working with LPOs or managed service providers is that they offer industrialized approaches typically lacking in law firms. By that I mean a combination of improved processes, properly deployed and used software, metrics, and right-fitted staff. Such capabilities allow firms that want to offer clients better value on routine legal matters a promising path. Operationally, however, firms need to work out detailed arrangements, including the ethics of marking-up the partner’s fees.

Separately, firms can turn to providers of flex-time attorneys. You recently featured, in this column, [Hire an Esquire](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__abovethelaw.com_2016_02_alt-2Dlegal-2Dthe-2D21bn-2Dcontract-2Dlawyer-2Dmarketplace-2Dis-2Dup-2Dfor-2Dgrabs-2Dhire-2Dan-2Desquire-2Dplans-2Dto-2Dcatch-2Dit_&d=CwMFaQ&c=4ZIZThykDLcoWk-GVjSLm9hvvvzvGv0FLoWSRuCSs5Q&r=JKLJue51C3qGeSHasAlx25mRGgNNjd4KgihAOdZ4s7k&m=blDU5r0w4Ty9pYnS5K99VGbMQV9yEwk35ODJ3PFzbgI&s=u2Crf1j2w6LrODRfZF7E1mq4IUSNvhgqpdnTKggSoy0&e=), which is one example of such a provider. And I recently [blogged about Crowd & Co](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__prismlegal.com_the-2Devolving-2Dcorporate-2Dlaw-2Decosystem_&d=CwMFaQ&c=4ZIZThykDLcoWk-GVjSLm9hvvvzvGv0FLoWSRuCSs5Q&r=JKLJue51C3qGeSHasAlx25mRGgNNjd4KgihAOdZ4s7k&m=blDU5r0w4Ty9pYnS5K99VGbMQV9yEwk35ODJ3PFzbgI&s=pKK86-gPk_CIGbs0Qtek4JNMFT4G-ZOWczqaoWXEkJM&e=), an Australian start-up that is creating a market in placing flex lawyers. These and other providers can provide law firms with lower cost, more flexible staffing. But law firms need to have a process in place to deploy and manage them effectively. I suspect that will take some trial and error to get right.

Joe Borstein: I see what you are saying, but it still shocks me . . . Why do you think Biglaw firms are so sensitive about partnering with alt.legal companies to provide cost-effective solutions for their clients? Wouldn’t this differentiate their offering and show their clients they are forward-thinking? From my (admittedly biased) view, the major buyers of legal services are aching for change, and would flock to the Biglaw firms looking to break rank and try something really, really new. What’s your view?

Ron Friedmann: I agree with your premise that clients would find attractive a partnering arrangement that really reduced cost and improved efficiency. I’ll offer here three somewhat speculative reasons why we don’t see more of this:

Psychology of Control. When I was on the management team of an LPO and selling to law firms, I saw that partners believed that not owning a resource meant a lack of control. While that was an honestly held view, I think it’s wrong. First, I’ve heard many a large firm COO admit in private that at least one or two staff departments had major problems. In those instances, full ownership by the partners was not yielding quality. And second, with an LPO or managed services provider, firms can sign a service level agreement that should give them sufficient control. In fact, to get to that SLA, firms will need to specify metrics – which they often lack today.

Operational Integration. Few large law firms act institutionally and systematically in allocating lawyers to matters. In many, even if formal systems are in place, a lot of assignments happen via informal channels. Integrating a third-party provider in this environment is hard. The type of alt.legal arrangement we’re talking about is necessarily institutional. But most of the action in a law firm is individual or at the practice group level. Without more central control, I suspect most management committees are reluctant to agree to any minimum commitment with an alt.legal provider.

Brand Perceptions. I’m guessing here, but my sense is that many large firms think that associating with an alt.legal provider would tarnish their brand. Another honestly held belief that is likely wrong.

Joe Borstein: So, to conclude, where do you see the alt.legal market going and what does it mean for traditional law firms?

Ron Friedmann: I think alt.legal has a great future. Clients pressure for value continues to grow so general counsels increasingly engage directly with alt.legal providers. That’s good news for lawyers who do not want a traditional practice and bad news for law firms.

Whether Biglaw rises to the occasion by working with alt.legal or adopting their ethos remains an open question. I certainly see it as a big plus for differentiation, for client value and for higher profits. If Biglaw does not get there, then alt.legal will just continue happening elsewhere. Not getting there won’t disrupt large law firms any time soon, but it will limit their growth potential.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

The COVID-19 outbreak is really getting the best of us. More than 50,000 people have died from the virus in the United States. The availability of toilet paper is a thing of the past. With social distancing measures in place, professionals are working from home, business on top, pajamas on the bottom, all while fearing for their job security. People have been quarantined for a month (or more), and they’re going stir crazy.  Instead of obeying stay-at-home orders, with some questionable direction from the president to LIBERATE their states, some are out protesting in the streets to reopen their local economies.

What more can we possibly do to protect ourselves from the coronavirus? [Russell Hedman](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/russell-benjamin-hedman), a senior associate at Hogan Lovells, has the answer — in song.

UPDATE: We caught up with Hedman, who’s been with the Rocket Surgeons band since he was in law school, and asked how he found the time to write this song and produce the video while keeping up with his work. “Like all lawyers with hobbies, I find time in the margins,” he said. “More than a few songs have been started on Hogan Lovells memo pads while I wait for a meeting to start.” As far as how his fellow associates can wind down during difficult times like these, here’s what he had to say:

Make the most of it. I usually complain that I don’t have enough time alone to write music. I guess the universe heard me.

# Unlocking Legal Careers In Texas: Navigating Opportunities In The Booming Energy Sector
## Explore the thriving legal landscape in Texas with Lateral Link’s Senior Director, Tori Keith, as she unveils invaluable insights into seizing career opportunities in the booming energy sector.

Amid a remarkable upswing in the energy sector, major corporations such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil are navigating the course through calculated acquisitions and sizable investments in oil and gas assets. This surge has significantly expanded opportunities for the legal industry, notably augmenting the demand for seasoned attorneys in Texas.

Navigating the Landscape of Energy’s New Era

“The energy landscape has made big headlines recently, with Chevron’s bold $53 billion bid for Hess Corp and Exxon Mobil’s significant $60 billion partnership with Pioneer Natural Resources, setting the tone for an era of consolidation and strategic investments,” observes Tori Keith, Senior Director at Lateral Link. This trend serves as a robust indicator of the sector’s vitality, fueled by rising interest rates, a cash-rich environment, and strategic foresight aimed at long-term growth. “Energy and oil deals have been constant throughout 2023. In fact, the energy and power sectors have surpassed technology as the primary driver of M&A activity so far in 2023. And it doesn’t seem to be slowing down,” according to a recent article in The American Lawyer titled “Deal Watch: Energy, the Largest Driver of M&A in 2023, Poised for Deal Barrage (and Maybe the Largest Deal of the Year).”

Additionally, an imminent vote on a constitutional amendment in Texas that, if passed by voters, will pave the way for the construction and operation of major power projects in the near future. Proposition 7 proposes the Texas Energy Fund, designed to tackle issues with the state grid by providing low-interest loans for the development of new power plants. $5 billion is earmarked for 3% interest loans for constructing new power generation facilities over 100 megawatts and fully dispatchable, which means the new power plants can support 20,000 homes or more, deliver power to the grid continuously, and are not weather-dependent. However, energy storage, such as battery technology, is excluded from these loans. Power plants operational by June 2029 will qualify for bonus payments. Beyond the initial $5 billion, additional funds are designated for refurbishing existing power plants, strengthening the grid near hospitals and other essential facilities, and for enhancements to grid infrastructure outside the main grid operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), as reported by the Texas Tribune on October 31, 2023.

“In Texas, we’re seeing a golden era for legal professionals, with the state emerging as a nexus for opportunities in all aspects of energy law, from traditional upstream and midstream transactions to mergers and acquisitions, and significant infrastructure projects, including finance,” Keith states. “Law firms with robust energy practices are poised to play a pivotal role in steering these complex transactions and navigating the intricate regulatory landscape.”

Legal Opportunities for Mid-Level and Senior Attorneys: A Pivotal Role

The energy sector is dynamic, complex, and truly fascinating. It encompasses a broad range of legal disciplines and novel legal issues, involving numerous stakeholders. It’s also intertwined with public policy that impacts every individual, along with many state and federal regulations. No two deals are the same, and the laws and investments are in constant flux.

In-Demand Legal Practice Areas

Keith highlights the practice areas experiencing growth:

- Projects and Infrastructure: “Legal professionals specializing in corporate finance are crucial in ensuring the financial robustness and integrity of these significant transactions.”
- Regulatory: Involving FERC and state-specific entities like ERCOT and PUC; addressing purchases and sales, contracts between companies and consumers, public authority requirements, and licensing.
- Transactional: “Attorneys adept at managing large-scale, intricate transactions are now at the forefront, playing a critical role in shaping the future of the energy sector.” This includes M&A, joint ventures, capital markets, private equity, venture capital, and project development and finance.
- Energy Law: “Expertise in energy law is more valuable than ever, with professionals needed to navigate the sector’s complexities, including issues related to production, distribution, and regulatory compliance.”
Texas: A Nexus of Opportunity

“Texas stands as a beacon of opportunity in this vibrant landscape, thanks to its pivotal role in the U.S. oil and gas sector and its business-friendly environment,” Keith emphasizes. “For legal professionals eager to distinguish themselves, the state offers a wealth of opportunities unparalleled elsewhere.”

With Lateral Link’s strategic insight and deep industry connections, legal professionals are well-equipped to navigate this dynamic field. The firm’s robust network within the legal community ensures that attorneys are well-positioned to capitalize on the burgeoning opportunities presented by the energy boom.

# Having Received Permission From Cravath, Another Firm Matches
## The market is responding in earnest to the Milbank bonuses.

Normally associate bonus season is a rapid-fire event with firms falling all over themselves to follow the first announcer within the hours and days that follow. But when Milbank set the annual bonus schedule last Thursday, an eerie lull descended over the market as everyone looked around wondering what would happen next.

Cravath usually sets the tone and everyone follows suit. But whenever another firm tries to move first, Biglaw leaders act like a killer robot asked to ponder a paradox about human love and steam shoots from their ears as they try to figure out what to do without Cravath’s seal of approval.

Thursday passed without any follow on. Then Friday. Then the holiday came and everyone wondered if we’d ever hear of another firm matching. Finally, Cravath decided to match Milbank and now the sluice gates on Flood Control Dam #3 are fully opened.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
This brings us to the news that Fried Frank has decided to match the Milbank scale in its New York, Washington, and London offices. The scale, for those who’ve forgotten since the last post roughly 20 minutes ago is…

Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012 – $100,000
Class of 2011 and senior – $100,000

There’s an added perk for Fried Frank associates, with the firm offering a premium of 15-30 percent over the designated class amount for outstanding performance. Special counsel and other attorneys will receive “individual” bonuses.

Bonuses will be paid out on or before December 31. Full memo available on the next page.

# Associate Bonus Watch 2019: Bonus Season Is Here!
## Wouldn’t it be nice if your law firm gave you a little something extra to be thankful for this year?

It’s November 1, and Thanksgiving is just a couple of weeks away, which means that bonus season is right around the corner. Wouldn’t it be nice if your law firm gave you a little something extra to be thankful for this year? We sure think it would be! As a little reminder — as if you really needed one — this is what [last year’s Cravath bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/) looked like:

Class of 2018 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2017 — $15,000
Class of 2016 — $25,000
Class of 2015 — $50,000
Class of 2014 — $65,000
Class of 2013 — $80,000
Class of 2012 — $90,000
Class of 2011 — $100,000
Class of 2010 — $100,000

For those of you who are wondering when your bank accounts will be a little more flush, here’s a list of the dates when year-end market bonuses hit Biglaw since 2006, the very first year Above the Law started publishing bonus news. Take a look:

With visions of bonus dollars dancing in your heads, it’s time to check in on how people are doing with their billable hours. There are just about eight weeks to go in 2019, and this year, as with every year, hitting your target is very, very important. Some firms might make bank-busting payments that will generate sweet headlines, but not all associates will hit the hours mark necessary for the top payment.

Still, with about two months to go, there’s plenty of time to get on your hours. Now that holiday season is on the horizon, attorneys may start poking around for an extra discrete assignment or two — after all, some hours here and there could mean a world of difference.

So how are people doing? Take our poll, and get a sense of how many hours your peers are on pace to hit in 2019. While you’re at it, let us know when you think this year’s bonuses will drop, and whether they’ll be higher or lower than last year’s bonuses.

# What Is Going To Happen To Sedgwick? UPDATE: The Firm Is Closing!
## Update: The firm speaks out!

UPDATE 11/21/17 2:00 p.m.: The worst fears of Sedgwick employees has been confirmed. Law360 is now [reporting](https://www.law360.com/articles/987383) the firm will be closing by the end of the year:

Sedgwick LLP told its employees on Monday morning that the firm would close at the end of December, a current firm employee confirmed to Law360 on Tuesday, capping off a year of defections and office closures that rocked the San Francisco-based firm.

It is unclear, at this point, what will happen to the firm’s attorneys and staff.

Despite numerous attempts by Above the Law to confirm the story with firm management, they have not responded.

UPDATE #2 11/21/17 4:01 p.m.: [Law.com reports](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/21/sedgwick-to-shutter-operations-in-january/) that a “large number” of attorneys and staff will be hired by Clyde & Co, who was, at one point, a potential merger partner for Sedgwick. Specifics on who will be hired and when has yet to be hammered out.

The firm also issued a statement:

“We have concluded that the best way to allow our lawyers to continue providing great service to our clients is by ceasing operations and moving to other excellent law firms,” said the firm in a statement. “We are pleased that most of our lawyers and staff have opportunities with very fine firms.”

….

“While this news deeply saddens all of us, we are very proud and appreciative of all those who helped make Sedgwick the great firm it has been since 1933,” the firm said. “From the bottom of our hearts, we thank our clients, attorneys and staff for everything you have done for us for decades, and we wish anyone who has ever crossed paths with this wonderful law firm the best and brightest future.”

Earlier: As a quick primer for those out of the loop regarding the Biglaw firm of Sedgwick, they haven’t been having a terrific 2017. Almost right from the [start of the year](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/40-lawyers-including-15-partners-are-leaving-this-biglaw-firm/), they began shedding partners and other senior attorneys. But the departures didn’t stop there. [Last month we noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/what-does-the-mass-exodus-of-partners-at-this-biglaw-firm-mean/) that a startling number of partners — including those involved with firm management — had left for greener pastures. Then an entire office [was scooped up](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/u-k-firm-scoops-up-entire-office-of-beleaguered-biglaw-shop/) by U.K. firm Kennedys. The firm’s headcount dropped by a whopping 35 percent this year, which includes the loss of over 45 partners.

Then began the rumors that Sedgwick had found a white knight to save them in the form of a potential merger with U.K.-based Clyde & Co. But according to [a report from Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/10/25/sedgwick-sees-clyde-co-tie-up-talks-hit-the-skids/), the picked-over carcass of a firm began to look less appealing to Clyde, particularly when so much money is still owed to the dearly departed (for other jobs):

“Clyde & Co clearly is losing the crown jewels they would want as part of a merger,” a source with knowledge of Sedgwick said.

One aspect of acquiring Sedgwick that could make a deal difficult is the mounting burden of capital it owes partners who have left the firm. Sedgwick typically requires that its partners carry a capital account equal to about 55 percent of the partners’ yearly compensation, said a former partner at the firm. The capital payments to departed equity partners are paid out in 36 monthly installments.

So if their white knight has gotten cold feet, what will happen to the firm? Are they looking for a new suitor, or is there something more dire in the firm’s future?

The buzzing of ATL’s network of tipsters has reached a fevered pitch over the last few days. While the future of the firm remains unclear, there are rumors flying around a plenty. Perhaps Clyde is only really interested in a particular group of Sedgwick partners now. One source claims management is saying whatever to “avoid even a further exodus.” Another says, “[T]here is a lot of confusion and non information to partners, which doesn’t help matters. No one has a sense of what is going on among younger partners.”

We’ve reached out to the firm, but they haven’t responded to our request for comment.

# Tea Time: In-House v. Biglaw

I love being in-house. Full stop.

At the same time, let’s not bury the lede. Going in-house is not all rainbows and butterflies all the time.

This is the post that my non-in-house folks have been waiting for — the post about some of the possible cons of going in-house.

So, in no particular order, here are some things that may make me miss Biglaw the tiniest bit.

My Downtown High-Rise Office

Don’t get me wrong. I work in a gorgeous new headquarters with a gym, a Starbucks, a juice station, and a mini-Wal-Mart with a pharmacy. I am so grateful. At the same time, I sometimes miss my former spacious office in downtown Dallas on the 15th floor of a high rise, overlooking the Dallas Museum of Art. Yes, I spent way too much time in that office, often envying all those who frolicked on the green lawn of the museum, but it was beautiful and mine to freely decorate. While I do have a private space now (where I cannot deface the walls with even tape), I initially was in an open workspace (aka cubicle), where I had to get used to working around others’ conversations (and loud chewing), and where I had to book a conference room or find a phone room to have privileged conversations.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Yet another #firstworldproblem — I can sense your eye roll, but I greatly miss having an administrative assistant who doubled as a personal assistant, who basically handled all things nonbillable so I could just work. While our in-house team currently has an amazing administrative assistant, the nine of us have to share her, including my associate general counsel. This means that I often make my own copies, do my own expense reports, and register for and schedule my own CLEs. (I know that you’re crying me a river right now).

Other Bougie Perks

Last shallow one I promise — I miss staying at the Four Seasons and Omni and J.W. Marriott and flying business class and not worrying about a per diem. In contrast, I distinctly remember one of my trips to interview for my current job. They accommodated me at the Holiday Inn closest to the airport (I put a chair against the front door and slept on top of the sheets) and had to drive a rental that still had roll-up windows. I figured it was a test they put all candidates through. While I have yet to stay at such humble accommodations now that I’m in-house, I am ever mindful of my obligation to be prudent with company money because I am a cost center.

Minimal Bureaucracy

This probably depends on the size of the company you’re at and its culture, but when you’re used to the fast pace of firm life, waiting for decisions to be made in-house can feel glacial, especially if a lot of stakeholders have to be consulted. I find that in-house politics is also more complex. Where power tends to be hierarchical and based on books of business at a firm, it’s hard to tell at a company who has influence.

Growth And Opportunity

Depending on the company, going in-house can feel stagnant, especially if you don’t proactively seek growth and development. If you’re not careful, you can find yourself on automatic pilot, “clocking in and out,” only to find yourself doing the same thing for 10 years. Organizations can also be flat, with promotions being improbable no matter how stellar you are just because there is a lack of openings until someone retires or leaves. Compensation may also be set, regardless of how much you work.

Ride Or Dies

While I love my in-house team, and I have certainly found a small tribe, there was just something extra about going through the trenches of litigation with other young lawyers, ordering pizza late at night at the office or working through Christmas on an appellate brief together — that creates a bond. Hazing maybe? It’s a culmination of associate lunches, traveling to depositions, trainings and retreats, and closed door meetings where we could safely vent and if needed, cry. Jokes aside, it’s hard to replicate the same camaraderie when you only see your teammates 9 to 5 and hardly travel together.

None of these things would make me go back to Biglaw because I absolutely love my job, but when nostalgia visits, these are a few things that come to mind. For my in-house colleagues, what else would add?

# And What Keeps You Up At Night?
## Cringe? Just consider it the gift that keeps on giving, years or decades after you though you'd buried the trauma.

What is your worst nightmare? I can think of many that, even while history, still make me cringe and that prompt sleepless nights. We’ve all had them and will continue to do so. Here’s just a sample:

Litigation holds can and do get screwed up in numerous ways. Back in dinosaur days, before there were vendors handling e-discovery and litigation holds, it was in-house counsel making sure that they were circulated to the right peeps and the right departments. Making sure that such holds were promptly done and that the information needed was correctly held led to many sleepless nights. Back then, my client’s policy was automatic deletion of emails after 90 days and that’s what we routinely told opposing counsel. However, that policy was suspended, and all emails were kept indefinitely. Of course, we who had the responsibility for litigation holds were never told of that suspension. Silos, anyone? Failure to communicate? You think?

That cringe-worthy situation came to mind because of the recent $4 million sanction leveled against JPMorgan Chase by the SEC for its failure to retain more than 47 million (not a typo) emails that the [SEC wanted in connection with various regulatory investigations](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/23/business/jpmorgan-chase-sec-emails/index.html). Yowzah! I can only imagine how many sleepless nights there have been resulting from this “whoops.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Then, of course, who can forget [the major snafu involving the two lawyers](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/chatgpt-phony-legal-filing-case-gets-lawyers-a-5-000-fine?source=newsletter&item=read-text&region=digest) who, to their detriment, relied on ChatGPT’s citing cases in their pleadings that only existed in the fertile mind of AI and who clung to that position long after they should have caved?

The court imposed a $5,000 fine, but that wasn’t all. The court ordered distribution of its 34-page sanctions opinion to the real-life judges that ChatGPT said handed down the fake opinions. The court dismissed the underlying case that started the whole mess, stating it was not timely filed. Exhibit A for the rule that when digging yourself a hole, stop digging.

Joe Queenan, the Wall Street Journal columnist, asked in his column last weekend whether it would be better if AI is not made all that intelligent. Queenan’s point is that merely average AI could be sufficient and could do some good. As he puts it, one benefit of average artificial intelligence is that it “will never forget who’s boss. It will never overstep its bounds. It will never get out of its depth.” What do you think?

How about this for a cringe-worthy situation? The County of Los Angeles, [which had used Lewis Brisbois](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/la-county-cutting-ties-with-lewis-brisbois-after-racist-emails?source=breaking-news&item=read-text&region=featured-story), will do so no longer. No surprise there, given the recent release of horrific emails to and from now departed former partners, who have now been kicked out of their new firm. The County will also decide whether to reassign current matters at the Lewis firm.

Even though an argument could be made that the bad dudes have left the building and that ends it, surely some people in the Lewis firm knew or had reason to know about the existence of such emails long before the departures. Please do not tell me that the IT peeps didn’t know what was going on. IT peeps know all about emails. Even in the late 1990s when technology was nothing compared to today, my client’s IT department nailed an executive for sharing porn on the company email system. Even after he was told to delete it, he did not, so he was sacked, justifiably.

The Lewis fubar will have “legs” for some time, if only as a well-deserved cautionary tale. And how can LA County continue to use a firm even on current matters, given what has happened and what it knows now? Wouldn’t that be like “do as I say, not as I do?” or some other equally trite maxim? The plaintiff’s bar would salivate if the County keeps to the status quo on current matters.

Here is a final cringe-worthy note, at least for 18 attorneys under investigation by the California State Bar arising out of a billing scandal involving a Los Angeles public utility and the Los Angeles City Attorney’s office. One attorney involved was to be sentenced earlier this week, but two bar investigators appeared at his sentencing hearing and asked that, since he’s been cooperating in the bar’s investigation of these attorneys, to postpone sentencing. [The court agreed.](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-27/state-bar-investigation-paradis-city-attorney-office) The convoluted facts in this lengthy snafu exceed my word limit, but here’s a good primer to what has gone on. Cringe-worthy indeed and another cautionary tale.

I have always thought that no client ever calls a lawyer to say that they have had or are having a great day or to thank counsel for the bullet that was dodged or for the good advice or because the case was settled for a de minimis amount. That may be part of the reason we are so hard-wired for gloominess. It is often the “shoulda, woulda, coulda” that is front and center with us, and that may be part of the reason why mental health issues are so prevalent. No wonder we have nightmares.

# What's The Biggest Law Firm In The Country?
## There's a new champion law firm when it comes to headcount.

We all know that, globally, the unholy Dentons/Dacheng merger created a firm with approximately 280 million attorneys. But what’s the biggest law firm in the United States?

Late last night, while you were fast asleep still in the office, Law360 released its master list of the top 400 law firms in the U.S. by size.

America’s next president Donald J. Trump will be happy to learn that [he’s represented](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/jones-day-helping-donald-trump-to-make-america-great-again/) by the biggest firm around. Jones Day tops the list with 1,684 attorneys. This vaults them past last year’s champion Morgan Lewis, who at the time was still digesting the carcass of Bingham it brought on. Morgan Lewis fell to third this year.

# The New Practice Area Blowing Up The Lateral Market
## On the back of a 'recording-breaking year,' real estate attorneys are finding out just how valuable they are in the lateral market.

We already know that the Biglaw lateral market [is on fire in 2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/). And firms *know* that, hence they’re throwing money at folks to keep them right where they are. For attorneys in super hot/busy practice areas, some Biglaw firms — [like Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-skadden-arps-handing-out-retention-bonuses-to-only-some-associates/) — are upping the ante with retention bonuses (not for everyone mind you, just for the über valuable attorneys in M&A and capital markets).

So when a particular practice starts really hopping, it’s worth sitting up and taking notice. And wow, is real estate a hotbed of lateral movement right now.

Take a gander at some of the recent lateral moves in the real estate space, as [reported by](https://www.law.com/2021/09/28/all-hands-on-deck-real-estate-partners-jump-ship-amid-historic-demand/) Law.com:

- Withers gained former Greenspoon Marder partner Loretta Thompson in Los Angeles;
- Loeb & Loeb got former Jones Day partner Peter Bergan in Chicago;
- Nixon Peabody picked up former Holland & Knight partner Laura Sugarman in New York;
- Riemer & Braunstein gained former Jones Day real estate partner Mark Appelbaum to open a Newport Beach, California office;
- Peckar & Abramson got former Eckert Seamans Cherin & Mellott lawyers Amy Hackett and Richard Briansky to open a Boston office;
- Virginia-based boutique Pender & Coward hired Richard Biemiller formerly of Parks Zeigler;
- Spencer Fane is opening a Fort Lauderdale, Florida office led by partner Shawn Whitney;
- Seyfarth Shaw hired partner Iryna Ivashchuk, formerly of  Berger Singerman,  in Atlanta;
- Forman hired Jason Gabriel, former city of Jacksonville, Florida, general counsel; and
- Georgia-based Bouhan Falligant hired Julia Weaver.
Bergan noted of his recent move to Loeb & Loeb, in real estate the “big” of Biglaw isn’t always the most important thing:

“I wanted to go to a firm where real estate is both national and growing,” Bergan said. “When I started looking at firms, I was surprised to see Loeb & Loeb had done things to grow their practice in LA and New York, to transform regional practices into more national practices.”

Robert Stern of Trenam said it’s super busy out there: “Our real estate and lending lawyers are jammed out and maxed out. It’s all hands on deck.” And Spencer Fane partner Shawn Whitney said 2021 looks to be a record-breaking year, “Last year was a record year in terms of deals closed, and this year I’m on pace to exceed that.”

No wonder the practice area is booming right now.

This is, well, something. We don’t cover every time a Biglaw partner sues someone, but this one is a doozy.

[Neil Gerrard](https://www.dechert.com/people/g/neil-gerrard.html) is partner in the London office of Dechert’s white collar, compliance and investigations practice. [In a complaint](https://www.law360.com/articles/1325754), Gerrard alleges a plot of long-term surveillance carried out by a former client, Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC), and says the scheme was illegal harassment designed to intimidate him. He’s suing for misuse of private information, trespass, harassment, and data protection breaches. According to the complaint, operatives for ENRC placed a tracking device on his car and followed. He also alleges hidden cameras were installed at his home and there was a bungled attempt spy on him and his wife while they were on vacation in St. Lucia.

In a separate, but apparently related matter, ENRC is suing their former attorneys at Dechert and inter alia, the former prime minister of Kazakhstan, in a legal fight over the Serious Fraud Office’s investigation into bribery and corruption allegations, though SFO has not, as of yet, filed any charges against ENRC. In that case ENRC general counsel, Beat Ehrenberger, [alleged Gerrard referred to billing practices in that case as being, “in rape mode.” ](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-most-offensive-way-to-refer-to-biglaw-bills/)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In a recent hearing, [as reported by Law360](https://www.law360.com/legalethics/articles/1325380/covert-spying-on-dechert-atty-wasn-t-illegal-enrc-says), Tom de la Mare, ENRC’s counsel, said there was nothing wrong with the surveillance, besides, it’s totally normal:

Installing camouflaged hidden cameras in a hedge outside Gerrard’s home supported ENRC’s “legitimate aim” of investigating suspected wrongdoing intended to be the subject of the mining company’s lawsuits against the SFO and Dechert, de la Mare said.

ENRC didn’t intend for Gerrard to uncover what it was doing, and so it makes no sense for him to claim the company was intentionally harassing him, de la Mare argued. The firm ENRC hired, Diligence International, carefully concealed its equipment up to professional standards and employed tactics used by the British military, he added.

“Where is the harassment if the surveillance was undetected,” de la Mare asked. “Let’s be blunt about it, this type of surveillance used to be common in commercial litigation.”

Surveillance isn’t illegal just because there’s a risk of detection, it has to be “oppressive” or “unreasonable,” de la Mare told Richard Spearman QC, sitting as a judge of the High Court.

A spokesperson for ENRC called the case “misconceived.” Regardless of the legal merits, it at least gets a gold star for weirdest Biglaw story of the day.

# Ask An Attorney: I Work In Biglaw. Should I Give Away My Sperm?

Life these days is full of asks. Your inbox if full of donation requests. Your senator needs a contribution. Your colleagues are buying a present for the secretary who’s retiring. But what should you do when your friends ask you to give them your sperm?

You work in Biglaw, so odds are high you are smart, and that’s a quality that is in big demand for hopeful parents. You might even have a good heart and want to help others, or more likely an ego that makes you want to spread your seed to carry on your legacy. So it’s possible that you should say yes when the request for your pro swimmers comes in. But let’s at least walk through some things to consider before making your decision.

There Is A Right Way and A Wrong Way

[  ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As you might recall, New York’s No. 1 sperm donor is a guy named [Ari Nagel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/i-want-to-put-a-baby-in-you-1-sperm-donor/?rf=1). But while anyone who wants to spread their seed far and wide may be impressed with Nagel, Nagel actually sets a very clear example of the wrong way to donate sperm. To start, using the customer bathroom at Target to collect the specimen is a major creeper move. Second, giving it away without a medical professional being involved exposes Nagel to maximum legal liability. (Nagel himself notes that he is surprised he has been sued for child support by only five women so far.) So if this is the wrong way, what’s the right way to give away your sperm?

Talk To An Attorney

Yep. You knew I was going to say it. But don’t just talk to me — talk to a qualified attorney in your relevant jurisdiction. Know what statutes, if any, might apply. For example, many states have a “donor” statute with specific requirements. A common one is that a “donation” has to be completed under the supervision of a licensed physician. That generally means Target bathrooms are off limits, and home insemination parties too, unless your doctor makes house calls. Also remember that you can’t trust the person you’re donating to when it comes to child support. Even if you are 100 percent sure you can trust their word that they will never seek child support, their word doesn’t always matter.

In a notorious Kansas Craigslist [case](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/using-a-turkey-baster-to-have-a-kid-thats-not-what-its-for-also-its-a-terrible-idea-legally-speaking/), a same-sex couple sought the help of sperm donor via Craigslist. The three of them found a draft contract that they liked on the internet. Everyone signed. Donation, impregnation, and child followed. Unfortunately, what also followed was the couple falling on hard times, and needing to seek public assistance. The state, in response, sought child support from the donor. The state argued that because the donor didn’t donate under the supervision of a licensed physician, he was not, legally, a “donor,” but instead the actual legal father. As father, he needed to financially support his child. The good news is that after years of appeals and fighting through the system, the spouse of the birth mother finally won recognition of her parental rights of her child, and therefore took the sperm donor’s legal place as the second parent. Good thing that donor didn’t donate to an unmarried woman!

Free Legal Representation

So the lesson is to know and follow the statute. While you are talking to your attorney, I recommend that you go ahead and hire him or her to represent you in a sperm donation contract. The good news is that you likely won’t need to pay that legal bill. Generally, in egg and sperm donation agreements, it’s the recipient who pays the legal fees for both their own attorney as well as the attorney for the donor.

Prepare to Be Patient — And Tested

It’s not just state regulation everyone to this arrangement needs to worry about. The FDA also has a say when it comes to the use of tissue and other body parts. As it stands, most clinics follow FDA sexually transmitted infection testing that involves a six-month quarantine. Although there are ways around it — like the donor and the recipients claiming they are sexually intimate — it’s a good idea to get the proper testing done, for everyone’s protection. That means being poked and prodded, providing a sample, and then returning six months later for more pokes.

Sperm donation can be an amazing thing. You’re helping to fulfill someone else’s dream of a family. So go ahead, if you think it’s the right choice for you. Just remember the value of attorneys, and that even Biglaw attorneys need other attorneys to get it right.

# Lawyers Should Listen To Adversaries More Often
## Being able to speak without interruption will tend to make your adversary less defensive, which might lead to better outcomes for your client.

I do not think I am going out on a limb too much when I say that most lawyers like the sound of their own voices. Indeed, many people enter the legal profession since they enjoy arguing, making points on behalf of others, and other forms of verbal advocacy. Unfortunately, it is true that sometimes the person who speaks the most in a given setting often has the best chance to obtain an advantageous outcome for their client. However, when speaking with adversaries, lawyers would often be best served if they listened more rather than made additional points, since this can make an adversary feel heard and provide a lawyer with information they might not have learned if they had spent more time speaking.

I recently had an interesting interaction with an adversary. We were going back and forth about the positions of clients, and I let my adversary say his piece and give his client’s side of the story. I then began to provide my client’s points about a given issue. I expected that I would be interrupted as I moved from point to point on behalf of a client, as this had been my experience when interacting with adversaries.

However, my adversary just let me speak. Only after it was clear that I had said everything that I wanted to say did my adversary finally jump in and provide some counterpoints to the arguments I had just conveyed. I actually thanked my adversary for not jumping in earlier and letting me get out all of the points I wanted to make before countering with his own opinions.

When I was able to fully express my side of the story without interruptions, I felt like I was able to say my piece without being attacked with interruptions from my adversary. This made it easier not to be defensive, and made it more likely that I would want to pursue collaborative solutions to the problem rather than take a zero-sum position on the matter. Moreover, listening more leads to much more civil discourse and can ensure that everyone has the full chance to convey their points, which is important when having discussions between adversaries.

Recently, I have tried to be much more deliberate in listening (rather than speaking) to adversaries, and it has yielded a number of positive outcomes. Last year, I was trying to settle a case after a few years of pretty intense litigation. The parties were relatively entrenched in their positions, but the lawyers were on relatively good speaking terms. At some point, my adversary and I began doing the back and forth that is pretty commonplace during settlement negotiations during which one party calls the other with a settlement demand, and the other counters and so forth.

During this entire time, I just resolved to let my adversary speak without interruptions during each of our exchanges. This was not easy since it is natural for a litigator to want to be an advocate and jump in when he thinks that an adversary has it wrong. The outcome was positive. I think my adversary enjoyed speaking his mind without having to be defensive about matters. Moreover, I bet my adversary felt heard, and knowing that another has empathy for a person can go a long way toward forging a connection between adversaries and in other contexts. We were eventually able to settle the matter on favorable terms for my client, and I am willing to bet that my approach of letting my adversary speak more was partially the reason.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I wish lawyers could listen rather than speak in other parts of the legal profession to positive effect, but this is often not the case. During oral arguments before a court, the party that speaks the most is often the party that wins a matter. This is because a judge is naturally going to give more consideration to the points of someone who has had more airtime in a given proceeding than the lawyer who has not had the chance to convey as much. This is a real shame since the party who speaks the most does not always have the best case. Although combative oral arguments can be persuasive to a court, they are not necessarily the best decider of who has the best position, and it would be great if this aspect of legal practice could be reformed as well.

In any event, when speaking to adversaries in private, lawyers might consider letting their adversary speak more than piping in with their own positions. This can help an adversary feel less defensive and listening more can uncover valuable information that can be useful to serving clients.

# Associate Compensation Scorecard (2017): Which Firms Have Announced Bonuses?

Since we broke the news of the market bonus scale for associates at large law firms in the United States — a trend that was [started by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/) on Monday, November 27, 2017 — many firms have quickly fallen in line and matched (or sometimes beaten) the scale. It’s still quite early in bonus season, so we’ve yet to hear from firms offering statements on why they’ve failed to match the market, and dozens upon dozens of firms have remained completely silent.

As we did when the [new associate salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) was announced by Cravath in June 2016, we are compiling a table of all the firms that have already matched the new bonus scale, the markets where those bonus matches were made, the minimum hours required to receive those bonuses (if available), and the date those bonuses will be paid. Today, we unveil that table for your viewing pleasure. We will be updating this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as news on bonuses is announced. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs clarification, [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Bonus%20Scorecard%20Correction).

Help us help you now (and if/when you decide to make a lateral move in the future). Let us know what your firm’s minimum billable hours targets are for bonus eligibility and when your firm will pay those bonuses. You generally must remain at your firm until the payout date to receive them, as stated in most memos, which could make it all the more difficult for you to leave your place of employment.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus season, everyone!

# Beyond Biglaw: 3 Phrases Associates Should Avoid
## Law firm life is challenging enough for associates; there is no need to make it worse by using language that paints the speaker as unfit for duty.

Law firms uniformly have high expectations for their associates. The size of the firm does not matter. Associates are expected to be dedicated to their work, helpful to partners and clients, and profit-generating for the firm. The associate experience can vary from firm to firm, but there are certain things that associates should almost never say in the presence of partners — especially when things are stressful, which for some firms is all the time. Associates are generally expected to contribute towards helping the partners navigate through stressful periods, not contribute additional stress.

For purposes of this column, I am not discussing personal interactions between partners and associates. There are rules and boundaries for both sides to keep in mind for those interactions, of course. But the focus of this column is on professional speech, and in particular situations where the associate is facing a request from a partner for more information of some kind. Whether the requested information centers on some aspect of legal research or client management does not matter. Our working assumption will be that the partner expects that the associate will deliver something of value in response to the inquiry at hand. (Of course, a good general rule that associates should follow — with all communications to both partners and clients — is to try and respond only when the associate’s response will contribute something of value to the questioner.)

Anyone who has worked in a law firm, however, knows that associates are sometimes presented with questions that demand an immediate response. Especially in times of heavy activity or intensity, there may not be an opportunity for an associate to formulate a perfect, or even a considered, response. At the same time, associates should always be careful not to call into question their own fitness for their position, by using language that is apt to generate concern in the audience as to the associate’s judgment.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We all know that law schools continue to pump out graduates irrespective of the market demand for them, and that law firms are well-stocked with experienced associates who are dissatisfied in some measure and looking to lateral. There is no reason to give a partner a reason to consider soliciting résumés from other associate candidates, whether via a call to the recruiting department or some form of external advertisement. It may seem harsh that a bad answer could even potentially lead to such drastic consequences, but such is the unforgiving nature of law firm life.

There are plenty of ill-advised things that I personally have heard associates say in the presence of partners or clients. While the vast majority of such verbal missteps have passed without incident, there is no way of calculating just how harmful those statements were for the associate who made them. For whatever reason, law is not a business where if you can make a good first impression you are golden. Associates must always make a good impression, and a single instance of creating a negative impression can be fatal to a career. Yes, an otherwise strong and productive associate can build equity that can shield them from some harsh consequences. But there is no sense in causing self-harm through lax attention to what comes out of one’s mouth either.

[If comments were still open](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-farewell-to-comments/), I have no doubt that the commentariat would be able to supply a long list of phrases that an associate should never utter, or at least use with extreme caution. My idiosyncratic list of three phrases for associates to avoid is as follows: 1) “I guess,” 2) “It’s not fair,” and 3) “It was ____’s fault.” In the history of law firms, I have to believe that each of those independently have resulted in associate dismissals — with a quicker axe for the poor associate who may have used them in some sort of career-killing combination. Sure, there is an argument that all of these phrases are actually a bit innocuous, and part of workplace conversation between superiors and subordinates throughout the corporate world. But what works in the halls of a typical office park does not necessarily correspond to what law firms consider acceptable discourse by associates.

First, the phrase “I guess” generates all kind of uncomfortable feelings when spoken by an associate to a partner or client. The associate thinks that they are hedging, or demonstrating common sense when they use their brilliant mind to venture a guess at an answer being sought. But what the superior hears is that the associate is a bit intellectually reckless, and perhaps unprepared to contribute to the matter at hand in a productive way. Associates are paid to know, and if they do not know, to research and educate themselves. Better to say nothing than to guess when a substantive response is called for.

Second, an associate claiming that something is “not fair” is basically advertising that they do not have the fortitude for true success as a lawyer. Litigation is not fair. Many things that lawyers are called on to do are not fair. Legal practice demands a resiliency that precludes the lawyer from sinking to the level of lamenting their situation. Clients pay lawyers for solutions to problems. Likewise, partners pay associates for help solving those client problems. Lamenting the unfairness of it all is an indulgence that partners can’t afford. Which means that associates don’t get to complain either — at least in the presence of clients or partners. Save it for your office’s Thursday or Friday night associate bar crawl.

Third, partners and clients have little to no tolerance for associates who look to blame others. Better to take responsibility for your role in whatever needs fixing, rather than attempt to shift the blame onto others. Again, the expectation is that you are competent to perform your job, and will be part of the solution to the partner or client’s problem. Associates who are known to view themselves as above reproach, while ascribing responsibility for problems onto others, are not held in good repute. This is not to say that an associate must bear responsibility for problems not of their making. But the better approach is to be proactive about discussing your role in the solution, and to let the partner or client decide who gets blamed, rather than reflexively blaming others as a starting point.

Ultimately, associates need to understand that while their actions go the furthest in determining their career trajectory, their words matter as well. Part of the expectation of a professional is that they avoid guessing, avoid complaining about circumstances outside of their control, and avoid blaming others. Law firm life is challenging enough for associates. There is no need to make it worse by using language that paints the speaker as unfit for duty.

# Some Clients Are Super Pissed About Associate Raises

While we respect the firms’ judgment about what best serves their long-term competitive interests, we are aware of no market-driven basis for such an increase and do not expect to bear the costs of the firms’ decisions.

–David Leitch, Bank of America’s global general counsel, in an email to an undisclosed list of law firms reviewed by the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-push-back-at-law-firms-starting-salary-hikes-1466029554). Bank of America (and [other corporate clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-do-and-should-in-house-lawyers-think-about-the-biglaw-pay-raises/)) might be pissed that firms are raising salaries for the first time in almost a decade, but you know what? At least Biglaw firms aren’t using a taxpayer bailout to fund the salary hikes (or million-dollar bonuses, like a [2009 report](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=8214818&page=1) from then-Attorney General Andrew Cuomo’s office indicates), so maybe Leitch should sit the hell down.

# Embracing Risk: How Uber GC Salle Yoo Defines Her Career

When you first enter Uber’s San Francisco headquarters, the buzzing of activity and achievement gradually swells all around you. It’s exactly what you would expect from a company whose size has more than doubled each year since its launch in 2010, delivering services in over 72 countries and 425 cities worldwide, and disrupting an industry that has been stagnant for decades. As Uber employees energetically zoom by in feverish conversation, Uber’s General Counsel, Salle Yoo, stands out as a centering force of calm, reason and thoughtfulness – an exterior hiding what’s clear as soon as she begins speaking: Yoo is a dynamic risk-taker.

The only word to describe Yoo’s first job in-house is “revolutionary.” Yoo has tackled some of the most intricate and complex legal issues across a multitude of both US and international jurisdictions, faced uphill litigation battles, and redefined the idea of risk. While, undoubtedly, Yoo’s success can be attributed to a variety of “right moves,” it is fundamentally defined by two characteristics.

1. Asking the Right Questions

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Yoo’s journey with Uber began with a simple question: what’s the worst thing that could happen? In Yoo’s thirteen years at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, her practice was an unusual mix of litigation and regulatory. She represented companies in California Public Utilities Commission proceedings but was also on the trial team that represented an airline in an insurance coverage case arising from the events of 9/11. Yoo wasn’t looking to leave her firm, but one weekend in April 2012, as she was juggling the competing demands of a birthday party for her young stepsons and the litigation needs of a new client who wanted to file a writ of mandamus on Monday, she became, in her own words “ripe for the picking [to go in-house].”

“The truth is that I didn’t actually know what Uber was when this job was first presented to me. That has been the cause of quite a few good laughs over the last four years,” says Yoo. Like all startups, Uber had an uncertain future and Yoo would leave the security of a law firm to join as its first lawyer. What really convinced Yoo to take the plunge despite the risk was asking herself the right questions.

Yoo says, “I read the job description and it was quite the mix of legal knowledge and surprisingly, I met every bullet point. I felt like the job was actually describing me better than I could.” While she wasn’t sure of everything the job would entail, she was excited at the opportunity but a bit unsure of leaving law firm life. “Lawyers are generally fairly risk-adverse. When I thought of leaving my law partnership for a start-up, it seemed pretty risky. But I decided that the real question in front of me was, when is the next time I’ll get an offer to be GC of a tech company?” Yoo says. “And more importantly, the right question was what’s the worst that could happen to my career?”

When Yoo took the job, she realized that, like her, Uber was about taking risks. The company is constantly pushing boundaries and changing the status quo. “One thing that start-ups believe is that standing still is moving backwards.” Managing legal risk while helping her company push forward as fast as possible has been instrumental to Yoo’s success. Yoo has reiterated and perfected the art of asking the right questions — even if they’re deceptively simple — in her four years at Uber.

2. Defining the “General” in “General Counsel”

As Uber’s first General Counsel, Yoo defined what the position meant to her and to her company. “When I first took this job, I had this idea that the ‘general’ in General Counsel means something more akin to an army general,” Yoo says. “But as Gordy Davidson (Fenwick, LLP), my outside counsel soon pointed out to me, ‘general’ actually means being able to broadly tackle any issue, whether familiar or not, in a thoughtful, business-oriented, and efficient manner.” As Yoo became more comfortable in her role, she realized how to put this into practice. She explains, “Ultimately, in a fast-paced startup, in order to succeed as General Counsel you have to focus on three things: growth, scale, and speed. You cannot let one fall off or the other two suffer greatly. All are critical for a company in high-growth mode.”

General Counsel often come from law firm backgrounds and are trained that it is critical to be a master of one’s craft. The transition to in-house can be quite treacherous, as a General Counsel’s success often requires being comfortable with the idea that they are the master of nothing, but must spot the issues in almost anything. “One of the most amazing things about becoming General Counsel of a company on the forefront of making legislative changes and completely revolutionizing an industry is the liberty to take risks,” says Yoo. “I’ve stopped counting the number of times the answer to a problem has been ‘well, it’s never been done before, but let’s figure out a way to move forward!”

In Yoo’s world, the word “risk” seems nearly synonymous with revolutionary. Both in the decision to join Uber and in her commitment to get incredibly comfortable with being uncomfortable, Yoo is reimagining what the traditional General Counsel role of “managing risk” is all about. As her department continues to expand, perhaps Yoo’s most long-lasting legacy will be having trained an entire cadre of lawyers to look at risk in a completely new and unique way. As she has pushed herself far outside of her 2012 comfort zone, she is also leading by example and embodying the very notion of fearlessness.

Olga V. Mack and Katia Bloom are startup enthusiasts who embrace the current disruption to the legal profession. Long gone are the days when in-house legal departments simply manage outside counsel or provide services. Today’s legal department is a sophisticated business unit that co-manages the company’s bottom line, embraces technology, and analyzes risks constructively. Mack and Bloom love this change and are dedicated to improving and shaping the future of the legal profession. Together they passionately collect and share inspiring stories of legal leaders who are thriving through the ongoing tectonic shift. Mack and Bloom are convinced that the legal profession will emerge from this revolution even stronger, more resilient, and inclusive than before. They are currently co-authoring a manual of the skills and traits lawyers need to succeed in — and even enjoy — today’s rapidly evolving in-house legal departments.

# Biglaw Firm Getting Dragged For Representing Alex Jones
## Biglaw firm probably doesn't love all this attention.

For as big of an industry as Biglaw is, its member firms prefer to keep a low profile. The lawyer shouldn’t *be* the story, right? (Side note: that’s why 1L year can be so disorienting, especially for people without family connections to the industry. Like — I thought a Cravath was a tie, what does that have to do with [associate compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/)??) Anyway, the Biglaw firm of BakerHostetler suddenly finds itself as the story — beyond the niche audience of Above the Law, natch — and it’s not a great look.

Rolling Stone [has an excerpt ](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/alex-jones-sandy-hook-lawsuits-pizzagate-qanon-1322849/)of Elizabeth Williamson’s new book, [Sandy Hook: An American Tragedy and the Battle for Truth](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/624175/sandy-hook-by-elizabeth-williamson/). The book details “the work of Sandy Hook parents who fought to defend themselves, and the truth of their children’s fate against the frenzied distortions of online deniers and conspiracy theorists.” And in the tidbits shared in Rolling Stone, the spotlight shines on Biglaw — specifically now former BakerHostetler partner Mark Bailen.

See, despite being described as “eschew[ing] the limelight,” Bailen represented noted conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Infowars after the host spread wild theories about the families of the victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Many of the Sandy Hook families filed defamation lawsuits against Jones, because of the abuse and lies heaped upon them.

Jones spread lies about the crime and the Sandy Hook families for years, accusing them of acting in a false flag operation, an Obama administration pretext for seizing Americans’ firearms. People who believed Jones attacked the families online, threatened their lives, accosted them on the street and at memorial events for their loved ones. A gun was fired into the home of one parent. Lenny Pozner and Veronique de la Rosa, parents of Noah Pozner, the youngest Sandy Hook victim, lived in hiding, moving repeatedly after conspiracists posted their addresses.

But the question of who would represent Jones in these circumstances gets a lot of focus:

In response to each suit, Jones had only doubled down.

“I’m sort of shocked he doesn’t have a lawyer trying to tackle him, going, ‘Dude, just stop talking about this.’

“You’re not doing yourself any favors, you know?’” [Kyle Farrar lawyer for the Sandy Hook families in Texas] said.

The three lawyers wondered who would defend Jones in Lenny’s and Neil’s cases. Jones could certainly afford counsel, and had lawyers at his disposal in other cases. But defending him against the Sandy Hook parents presented a different and unsavory challenge.

“I don’t think any of what I would consider some of the prestigious defense firms would want their name associated with him,” Farrar mused. “Who wants to sign on to that?”

But the then-Biglaw partner did sign on to represent Jones. “For reasons even his fellow media lawyers told [Williamson] they struggle to understand.”

Though actually figuring out that Biglaw was involved in the Sandy Hook litigation took some sleuthing:

It would take the Texas lawyers a while to discover traces of BakerHostetler’s work in at least one Sandy Hook case. In a court filing in Neil’s lawsuit dated August 27, 2018, Jones’ father, David Jones, referred to Mark Bailen of BakerHostetler as “one of our lawyers.”

The elder Jones’ declaration included a letter Bailen sent to Google on Infowars’ behalf on August 16, 2018, after Google terminated its content hosting services agreement with Free Speech Systems, LLC, Infowars’ parent company.

Not long after that, [Mark Bankston Sandy Hook family attorney] found a 2018 Infowars email in a trove of Infowars documents released as part of pre-trial discovery, in which Mark Bailen and Texas lawyer Eric Taube “were deciding on what evidence to secure, what transcripts to get for discovery,” in Neil’s lawsuit against Jones, Bankston told the judge in an August 2021 court hearing. Separately, I read another 2018 Infowars email released in court proceedings that described Infowars staffers’ efforts to gather and send documents to Bailen.

As Mark Bankston, a Texas lawyer who represents Sandy Hook families, notes,  “I was certainly surprised to find documents showing an elite D.C. society lawyer had been behind the scenes helping coordinate this catastrophe from its earliest stages. I don’t understand the motivation, but it struck me as cowardly not to put your name on this, to hide behind the scenes.”

Besides only working behind the scenes perverts the most likely justification for Bailen’s representation. There’s an old, [silly argument](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/going-ahead-and-naming-names-of-lawyers-working-for-russian-regime/) that “everyone deserves an attorney” borrowed (and corrupted) from the criminal context (where it’s actually foundational to our justice system) to justify a [whole manner](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/how-much-does-your-biglaw-firm-contributes-to-climate-change/) of [unsavory](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/biglaw-partner-wants-to-know-how-responsible-sandy-hook-first-grader-is-for-his-own-murder/) Biglaw [clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/oh-look-at-the-biglaw-firm-representing-oan/). But here, Jones *has* attorneys of record. Bailen/BakerHostetler are just parachuting in to make sure that representation is top notch.

And now that the cat’s out of the bag, the attention has been far from welcome. Williamson describes the pushback she received when she started drilling into Bailen’s involvement in the Sandy Hook cases. In part because Bailen’s wife, Jessica Rosenworcel, is now the chair of the Federal Communications Commission. And in the lead up to her nomination for the job, Williamson asked Rosenworcel about Bailen’s representation of Jones and was told they have “very separate professional lives.” She also asked Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) about it, as he was a supporter of Rosenworcel for the position and he also represented Sandy Hook families in the Senate. And when Bailen finally answered questions about his representation, well, his reasons are far from clear:

Bailen had raised concerns about journalistic fairness and standards, and objected to the “tone” of my questions. This was one: “A firm of BakerHostetler’s caliber can choose its clients. Why did Baker choose to represent Jones?”

“A hallmark of First Amendment law is that it seeks to protect speech that may be unfair, unpopular, and sometimes outrageous,” Bailen wrote. (He insisted that all our exchanges be in writing.)

Neither he nor BakerHostetler had been Infowars’ “counsel of record” in the Sandy Hook lawsuits, he wrote. I knew that: His involvement was strictly behind the scenes. Bailen called my reporting on his work for Infowars “inaccurate,” but when I asked for specifics, he declined to provide any, writing, “My ethical obligations as a lawyer prevent me from discussing details of former client engagements, irrespective of whether any elements of them have become public.”

Bailen left BakerHostetler in February of this year, which is the only comment the firm would make to Williamson about the matter. And, even before that, in 2020, the firm’s representation of Jones was over:

In late 2021, about a year after BakerHostetler stopped working for Jones, judges ruled Jones liable by default in all four Sandy Hook lawsuits, a sweeping victory for the families. In trials beginning this spring, juries will decide how much Infowars must pay the families in damages. Infowars documents provided to the families’ Texas lawyers in preparation for those trials say Bailen “had to withdraw because of his wife’s employment.”

But this is still the worst kind of publicity for the firm — and Bailen.

# Judge Offers Trump Lawyers Free Lesson On How Privilege Works
## The tricky thing about attorney-client privilege is... well, nothing really.

Attorney-client privilege is difficult to master. An attorney, giving legal advice to a client, and only to the client and not disclosing it to an adversary or a third-party? What a slippery concept!

At least that’s what Trump’s legal team thinks. In reality, it’s an entirely straightforward concept and that’s what Justice Arthur Engoron thought when he issued a terse, one-paragraph order demanding Morgan Lewis drop its theatrics and hand over a bevy of materials that it tried to withhold from the New York Attorney General’s office on privilege grounds.

Morgan Lewis, [in the midst of severing its ties to the toxic former president](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/morgan-lewis-bockius-llp/), marked multiple communications as privileged — suggesting that the communications were “quarterbacked” by partner Sheri Dillon even if they don’t appear to involve any legal advice at all, and had already been selectively produced to a third party. Those are typically no-nos when it comes to asserting privilege but fortune favors the bold, I guess! After looking through the material, Engoron determined that fortune did not.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The Court finds that many of the communications Morgan Lewis marked as privileged were communications addressing business tasks and decisions, not exchanges soliciting or rendering legal advice. “[A] lawyer’s communication is not cloaked with privilege when the lawyer is hired for business or personal advice, or to do the work of a nonlawyer.” Spectrum Systems Intern. Corp. v Chemical Bank, 78 NY2d 371, 379 (1991). Similarly, any communications within Morgan Lewis speaking to public relations are of a business, not legal, nature. Moreover, as previously noted, a client waives the privilege if communications are made in the presence of, or are subsequently revealed to, a third party. Ambac Assur. Corp. v Countrywide Home Loans, 27 NY3d 616, 624 (2016).

It’s almost as though Trump brought lawyers into non-legal conversations for the express purpose of invoking attorney-client privilege to keep investigators out of potentially problematic conversations. Like discussions over the valuation of his properties, especially assessments performed for the decidedly non-legal purpose of applying for loans or insurance coverage. But obviously they would never do something like that because that would be as wrong as it is transparently simple to overcome.

Shady valuations are at the heart of years’ worth of allegations about the Trump Organization. Everyone’s favorite Thomas M. Cooley Law School graduate, Michael Cohen, testified that Trump would inflate valuations for banks and then turn around and deflate those valuations for tax authorities, in what amounts to keeping two sets of books and either defrauding banks, cheating the government, or both.

This opinion is refreshingly to the point. A federal judge would find a way to churn out 15 pages with five or six citations for every point. Justice Engoron went the other way and sent a message through his brevity that he’s done having to field remedial Evidence issue-spotters from Morgan Lewis and the Trump Organization.

# Texas Legislators Threaten Sidley Over Abortion Care Travel Costs
## They're going after big (law) dogs.

Well, [we knew it’d come to this](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/red-states-arent-going-to-be-satisfied-with-overturning-roe-next-up-travel-bans/). Right-wing, anti-choice legislators are unhappy merely regulating women’s bodies within [the borders of their state](https://twitter.com/Kathryn1/status/1540710713965936640?s=20&amp;t=q70keGup7kI3o4DfitRgOA), so they’ve kicked it up a notch. In the wake of the Dobbs decision overturning the constitutional protections for reproductive freedom in Roe v. Wade,[ a number of employers](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/business/abortion-companies-travel-expenses.html) have promised to pay travel costs for any employee who seeks abortion care but cannot access it in their home state. And [Biglaw has also stepped up on this issue.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/which-biglaw-firms-will-cover-travel-expenses-for-employees-who-can-no-longer-access-abortion-care/) Yes,[ it continues to be bullshit](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/corporations-are-an-unexpected-ally-in-making-abortion-accessible-theyre-also-a-part-of-the-problem/) that we’re depending on corporations and employers for bodily autonomy, but until there is a more lasting solution, this employment benefit could make all the difference in the world for someone who wants an abortion now.

But as band-aid-like as this temporary solution is, some [Texas legislators](https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/texas-gop-upset-citi-will-cover-travel-costs-for-employees-seeking-abortions-in-other-states-13623800) are determined to ban that practice as well. Their latest target? Biglaw giant Sidley.

Yesterday, Sidley Chair [Yvette Ostolaza](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/how-sidley-creates-a-positive-culture-at-the-firm/) received a letter (below) from the ironically named Texas Freedom Caucus threatening the firm for taking care of the healthcare needs of its employees:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Abortion is a felony criminal offense in Texas unless the mother’s life is in danger. See West’s Texas Civil Statutes, article 4512.1 (1974) (attached). The law of Texas also imposes felony criminal liability on any person who “furnishes the means for procuring an abortion knowing the purpose intended.” West’s Texas Civil Statutes, article 4512.2 (1974). This has been the law of Texas since 1925, and Texas did not repeal these criminal prohibitions in response to Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). These criminal prohibitions extend to drug-induced abortions if any part of the drug regimen is ingested in Texas, even if the drugs were dispensed by an out-of-state abortionist. To the extent that Sidley is facilitating abortions performed in violation of article 4512.1, it is exposing itself and each of its partners to felony criminal prosecution and disbarment.

The letter also details proposed legislation to be introduced in Texas that will “impose additional civil and criminal sanctions on law firms that pay for abortions or abortion travel.” The “Freedom” Caucus would like to impose felony criminal sanctions on anyone paying for an abortion, allow private citizens to sue over it [à la SB 8](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-this-how-abortion-goes-out-not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper/), and any lawyer who “furnish[es] the means for procuring an abortion knowing the purpose intended” will face disbarment. The letter threatens, “The state of Texas will ensure that you and colleagues are held accountable for every abortion that you illegally assisted.”

We reached out to Sidley for comment, but did not immediately hear back.

In this fight over the fundamental right to travel — for whatever reasons — Sidley will need a few good lawyers. Fortunately, I hear they’ve got a few of those kicking around.

# The Latest In Biglaw Hotness? Color-Coded Wristbands
## Trying to keep the awkward conversations to a minimum.

 The latest trend in COVID accommodations are color-coded wristbands — because as much as some folks are ready to return to their pre-pandemic lives, not everyone feels the same way. So for big events, like [weddings](https://www.brides.com/social-distancing-wedding-products-5188723) or [similar](https://emmalinebride.com/covid/wedding-wristbands/), it’s become trendy to offer guests a choice of wristbands to indicate their comfort level. Green means you’re cool with physical touching, like handshakes and high fives and are ready to party like it’s 2019. Yellow indicates a more cautious approach… think elbow bumps. While red says, please stay 6 feet away and mask up.

But now this wedding trend has jumped to the corporate world. Global law firm Clyde & Co — with 2,500 legal professionals worldwide — has made the move to these color-coded wristbands as they ease their way back to the office, as[ reported by](https://www.legalcheek.com/2021/10/clyde-co-introduces-coloured-wristbands-so-lawyers-can-indicate-how-covid-cautious-they-are/) Legal Cheek:

“Our shift to hybrid working has been really positive, but we are keen to make sure that everyone feels comfortable in the office and confident to express their preferences,” said Rob Hill, partner and chair of the firm’s UK board, in a statement. “We’ve introduced wristbands, an idea which we have seen other organisations use, as a way of drawing attention to the fact that we shouldn’t assume all our colleagues feel the same about things like shaking hands, mask wearing or social distancing.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s a good reminder that[ no one really knows](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/return-to-the-office-how-much-money-would-it-take-for-lawyers-to-give-up-remote-flexibility/) what post-COVID looks like or when we’ll get there. And they[ aren’t looking forward](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaw-associates-are-lateraling-to-escape-returning-to-the-office-in-covid-times/) to going back to the office. But at least this provides a quick and easy way for folks to signal their comfort level… without the awkward conversations.

Many lawyers have side hustles, but some of them are a lot cooler than others.

Meet [Wayne Barnes](https://www.squirepattonboggs.com/en/professionals/b/barnes-wayne), a partner in the London office of Squire Patton Boggs. In his spare time, Barnes works as an international rugby union referee, and he’ll soon be “laying down the law” at the Rugby World Cup final. [The Sun](https://www.the-sun.com/sport/9405074/wayne-barnes-lawyer-refereeing-rugby-world-cup-final/) has additional details:

Barnes, 44, has been handed the honour of taking charge of his first World Cup final.

He refereed at the 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019 tournaments, aged just 28 at the the first.

Barnes has already officiated five matches at France 2023 – including the thrilling New Zealand quarter-final victory over Ireland – as well as being an assistant in two more.

When Barnes found out that he’d been chosen to take on this role, he excitedly tweeted: “It is the greatest honour of my career to be given the responsibility of refereeing a Rugby World Cup final 2023.”

Congratulations to Wayne Barnes, and best of luck on the pitch!

# Uh-Oh! Biglaw Firm Pares Down Its Summer Associate Program -- One Week Before Interviews
## Contrary to its theme song, not everyone is a winner at this firm.

On-campus interviewing season is already in full swing at some law schools, but many will be starting up next week. Law students are already nervous about whether they’ll be able to secure an offer for a summer associate placement. And one firm just made their anxiety a little worse, after career services offices in the Northeast and on the West Coast alerted some students that their interviews with the firm had been canceled.

Uh-oh! What in the world happened here?

Earlier today, we began receiving word of the worrying news that Nixon Peabody had allegedly withdrawn from all on-campus interviews at all law schools. Students thought it spelled bad news for the firm. Students at one Boston law school received this message from their career services office just before 9 a.m.:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


That’s a bit alarming. Could it be that the firm is in some sort of trouble? Not exactly. As it turns out, that email from career services wasn’t entirely correct. Here’s an official statement from Nixon Peabody about the situation:

We’ve decided to put our Summer Associate Program on hold in 2018 in two markets (Boston and San Francisco). As a reference, our summer associate class in these two markets (Boston and San Francisco) in 2017 included five associates (3 in Boston; 2 in San Francisco).

We are constantly evaluating the needs of our markets and our clients and exploring new ways to attract and retain great talent which includes school-year law school internships which we are already doing in other offices with good success. We are not eliminating our summer program. In 2018, we will continue our summer associate program in five of the seven offices that participated this year. Those locations are: Chicago, New York City, Washington, D.C. Rochester, NY and Long Island.

We have not withdrawn from all OCI engagements. We will continue to participate in various law school recruiting events and on-campus visits, and will evaluate the individual associate recruiting needs in each office on an ongoing basis.

As it turns out, the firm’s [theme song](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/08/nixon-peabody-this-is-not-a-love-theme-song/) is incorrect — not everyone is a winner at Nixon Peabody — and especially not those who hoped to interview with the firm in Boston and San Francisco. Better luck next year, when we hope the firm is able to do a little better with the timing of such announcements.

# Did Brett Kavanaugh Know About Alex Kozinski?
## Will anybody ASK him?

The media is busy falling over itself [praising the sterling résumé ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/dont-let-them-gaslight-you-into-supporting-brett-kavanaugh/) of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump’s new pick to effectively immunize Trump from the Russia investigation. But one key validator is missing from the Kavanaugh party, former Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski.

Kavanaugh clerked for Alex Kozinski in 1991. Kavanaugh would not have been a clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy if he hadn’t first been a clerk for Kozinski. Kozinski was a prominent and popular feeder judge to the Supreme Court, and a moderate, or at least “non-Trumpian” conservative who could be a useful voice in Kavanaugh’s favor at this time.

Of course, we all know why Kozinski isn’t in front of the cameras standing by his former clerk. [Kozinski resigned from the Ninth Circuit in disgrace](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/breaking-judge-kozinski-is-retiring/) after [allegations of sexual harassment](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/judge-kozinski-accused-of-sexual-misconduct/?rf=1) surfaced. Kozinski is one of the only federal judges to be held accountable for his actions in the #MeToo era.

What, if anything, did Kavanaugh know about Kozinski’s behavior? What, if anything, did Kavanaugh do to help the women being harassed by the judge?

This isn’t some guilt by association thing. Reports indicate that even after his time as a clerk, Kavanaugh and Kozinski remained close. He was there while harassment was allegedly occurring.

Courtney Milan, a law professor turned romance novelist who clerked for Kozinski, has been tweeting about just how deep the connection was between the two men:

They worked together on hiring.

Kozinski regularly used belittling and demeaning language in hiring with us as his clerks.

I cannot attest to whether he used it in Kennedy screening, but it would surprise me if he didn’t.

— Courtney!!! Milan

The way powerful men become sexual predators is that other powerful men refuse to call them on it. Given that we are about to elevate Kavanaugh to become one of the most powerful men in the country, it’s relevant to know what he did when confronted with sexual harassment in his own workplace. Who knows what kinds of sexual harassment issues Kavanaugh will have the opportunity to decide on over the next 30 years or so. Whether the man can even recognize sexual harassment WHEN HE SEES IT is relevant.

There’s an opposition research document on Kavanaugh that made the rounds that tried to make this point. [From Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/04/trump-supreme-court-pick-brett-kavanaugh-694787):

The document argues it is virtually impossible that Kavanaugh, who served on a screening committee for Kennedy’s Supreme Court clerkship alongside Kozinski, was unaware of Kozinski’s behavior — though nobody has stepped forward to make that explosive allegation in public.

Kavanaugh clerked for Kozinski nearly three decades ago, early in his time on the bench and before Kozinski is accused of having spoken and behaved inappropriately toward women. But the two have maintained a fruitful professional collaboration for years after.

“After these allegations were reported in the press last year, I spoke with various former Kozinski clerks — including Judge Kavanaugh. None of us, including Judge Kavanaugh, had heard of any of these troubling allegations,” said one former Kozinski clerk.

Right. Sure. I am shocked, shocked, to find that gambling is going on here.

We know turning a blind eye to sexual harassment goes down as a “pro” in Trump’s book. Does that sentiment extend to the entire GOP? We can assume that at least one Democrat will ask him about Kozinski — my money is on Kamala Harris. But will any of the Republican Senators demand that Kavanaugh account for his time under Kozinski? Or is #MeToo just not something the ruling party will concern itself with?

I assume team Trump did no vetting on this issue, because they honestly do not care. It’ll be left to the Senate and (cough) the MEDIA to demand answers on these questions.

You know, instead of just writing puff pieces about how good his résumé looks, and repeating whatever quotes are fed to you from the White House, maybe some of you people who have ear of the ruling Republican class can get out there and do some work?

Kavanaugh isn’t exactly taking my calls.

# With Profits Per Partner This High, It Was Only A Matter Of Time Until Associates Got Raises
## Another firm proves they are part of the select MoneyLaw club.

When your firm boasts profits per partner (PPP) that top $2 million, you’d best believe associates want a cut of the action. We are in the midst of a heady time, with Biglaw firms rushing to give their hardworking associates a raise, the first in almost a decade, to prove they are part of the select MoneyLaw club.

Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft pulls down PPP of [$2,060,000](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755653273), according to the latest [Am Law 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/) rankings, so we assumed it was only a matter of time until they announced they were increasing associate compensation to be in line with the Cravath scale, announced last week. In fact, only two firms with higher PPP [have yet to announce](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/profits-per-partner-at-am-law-100-firms-that-have-not-raised-salaries-for-associates/2/?rf=1) if their associate compensation will lag behind the market (King & Spalding and Dechert; Wachtell Lipton has not revealed any changes to their compensation structure, but they were already ahead of the market). So it was with as much relief as excitement that associates greeted today’s pay raise news from CWT.

The firm announced raises for their U.S. and London offices. The class of 2016 and summer associates will also benefit from the firm’s largesse, and those off the grid, or in other offices, will be told individually about their compensation.

# It's Okay To Cry At Work
## There are a lot of smart, capable, talented attorneys who process their frustration or anger or stress over a situation with tears.

I’ve often heard well-meaning female mentors tell young impressionable lawyers they should never cry at work. Or, perhaps more realistically, never let other people see you cry. So, when the anger at some work-related slight boils over and the need to cry is inescapable, they close their office door or find an empty bathroom stall and have their tears hidden away like a shameful secret.

Here’s the thing: there are a lot of smart, capable, talented attorneys who process their frustration or anger or stress over a situation with tears. So why do we act like that is unacceptable? Being a lawyer is a tough job and there are bound to be countless situations where you will feel anger and frustration, but crying over that is still seen as weak. Contrast that with another popular coping mechanism — yelling. Plenty of senior Biglaw (and Small Law and In-House) lawyers are known for screaming at associates (or, well, anyone who has the misfortune of being around) when things go wrong, even if the yellee isn’t responsible for the issue. So why is yelling considered a fact of law firm life?

I mean, this is a trick question. You know why. If you’ll excuse me for gender essentializing for a moment: It’s because women tend to be the criers. The “rules” for what’s considered acceptable office behavior were created in [an era](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/you-wont-believe-this-infuriatingly-sexist-law-firm-memo-from-the-1950s/) where women weren’t allowed to participate in work outside of the home, so of course behavior stereotypically associated with women is frowned upon. (If you’re a man who sheds tears of frustration at work, know that I support you too.)

You know what? That’s horseshit.

I’m tired of it and you should be too. There are[ well established](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/emotional-freedom/201007/the-health-benefits-tears) health benefits to crying — our bodies literally excrete a stress hormone and other toxins when we cry and it stimulates the production of endorphins, so you really do feel better when you’re finished crying. It’s science. But when professional women engage in this healthy behavior they’re made to feel shameful. That’s still horseshit.

I’ll admit some women use tears as a weapon to get what they want or to get out of an [uncomfortable situation](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ899418.pdf), which is fucked up. Don’t do that. But the far more common workplace situation is when women are made to feel like they don’t measure up to some invisible (male) standard when they use tears as a coping mechanism.

Now, I’m not suggesting you have to cry publicly, but let’s at least admit we do it. It’s a natural and healthy way to deal with the stress that comes as part of the job. It does not reflect, in any way, on your capabilities as an attorney. We need to shout that from the rooftops until everyone understands.

# Defunct Legal Vendors Can Create Lots Of Problems
## Be sure that the legal vendors you choose are both reputable and financially secure.

Attorneys rely on all kinds of legal vendors in order to most efficiently handle matters for clients. Lawyers routinely hire vendors to handle e-discovery issues, manage significant print jobs, or complete other tasks that law firms cannot manage in house. However, lawyers need to be careful when choosing legal vendors and ensure that legal vendors are both reputable and financially secure. If a legal vendor goes out of business, this can create numerous issues for lawyers and their clients that attorneys might not be able to fix.

Several years ago, I had to pick up the pieces after a legal vendor went out of business, and the situation can be instructive for other lawyers. In the past, I have used a particular vendor when handling depositions since this vendor was a big name in the legal industry. Of course, depositions need to be managed by neutral parties, and lawyers routinely rely on legal vendors that specialize in deposition services in the course of their practices. One time, an adversary of mine booked a deposition using a different legal vendor that I had never heard of before. This vendor had an easy-to-use online interface, and the prices were much better than other similar vendors with which I had worked in the past. I thought that I could save the client money by using this particular deposition vendor rather than a mainstream vendor, and for several depositions, the vendor performed perfectly.

Then, one time shortly after using this vendor (and after fully paying for its services), I received notice that the vendor going out of business. I needed this vendor to complete the services for which we paid, and there were deadlines that were fast approaching in the case. I called every single telephone number I found for this vendor, and messaged every email address I could find, but got absolutely no response. I thought that the legal vendor had pulled a “rug pull” on its clients and left numerous law firms in the lurch.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Eventually, a substitute legal vendor stepped in and completed the work that was supposed to be handled by the initial legal vendor that went defunct. Thankfully, all deadlines were met, and there were no consequences to the case because of the vendor going out of business, except for paying some extra money to the substitute. However, this entire experience made me much more likely to use the services of one of the big vendors in legal industry next time so that I could avoid a situation like this in the future.

Over the years, I have heard through the grapevine a few other stories of legal vendors going out of business that should also give lawyers pause. I once worked at a law firm that used a particular company to provide expert services for a specific type of case we handled. The company was affordable, and usually, they were dependable.

One day, we got word that this company was going out of business even though they had failed to complete a report that we needed to file in the case. We ended up informing the court of the situation and requested that we be allowed to use a different expert and undertake further inspections so that we could have a proper expert report in that matter. I don’t remember if the court allowed us to retain a substitute expert, but I would not be surprised if we were precluded from proceeding with a substitute expert even though the initial expert was unavailable. I have also heard of experts retiring, and even passing away, and how these circumstances can create issues for a case.

I also once heard a story from an old-timer attorney who frequently used a particular appellate printing company. Back in the day, in certain jurisdictions (and perhaps in the present, I have not filed an appeal since 2015!), litigants filing appeals needed to print books containing appellate briefs and the appellate record connected to a given appeal. The vast majority of lawyers would contract with an appellate printer to complete this task, and many appellate printers can also provide advice on the intricacies associated with filing an appeal.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

In any event, apparently this lawyer used an appellate printer that went out of business before it could complete the printing work for a given appeal. This made it extremely difficult for the lawyer to perfect the appeal, since he had to hire another printer to complete the work on short notice. Since some appeals are perfected close to the deadline, I can only imagine the difficulties this situation created for the lawyer.

In the end, I’m not saying that lawyers should always use bigger legal vendors, since smaller vendors might have lower prices and better customer service. However, attorneys should be aware that legal vendors can and do go out of business and this can create a number of difficulties for law firms and their clients.

# Biglaw Firms Should Give Associates Bonuses On This 'Giving Tuesday' So They Can Give Back
## Lawyers should pre-spend some of their incoming bonus money on something noble: giving back to their communities.

Associates are still waiting on [bonus (and raise!) announcements](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) from Biglaw writ large, but we have a feeling that soon their bank accounts will be a little more flush with cash. We know you’ve got big plans for all of that money. Maybe you’re in the market to purchase your own Lawyerly Lair, despite today’s mortgage rates. Perhaps you’re planning to completely pay off your student loans. Or maybe you’re willing to pre-spend some of your bonus bucks to make the world a little better for someone you don’t even know.

If you’re feeling altruistic, why not make a charitable donation to support a good cause? Today is [Giving Tuesday](https://www.givingtuesday.org/), and it’s a time to give back to your community, whether through donations of your time or your money. Don’t forget that your law firm may be willing to match any of your charitable contributions. Some ideas:

# Mandatory Retirement Policies: A Source Of Vulnerability And Opportunity
## Roughly half of Am Law 200 firms have mandatory retirement, with most specifying ages in the range of 63 to 68.

King & Spalding scored two notable coups this year when it lured prominent litigators Randy Mastro and Mark Kirsch away from Gibson Dunn. The loss of Mastro in particular was a serious hit for Gibson: in more than two decades at the firm, Mastro had accumulated a multitude of lucrative and high-profile clients, ranging from Chevron to Chris Christie.

Mastro and Kirsch undoubtedly weighed many factors in deciding to move. Lately, there have been rumblings in the market about office politics involving leadership in Gibson’s litigation group, so it’s possible that played a role. The rising fortunes of King & Spalding presumably helped: thanks to 25% growth in profits per equity partner from 2020 to 2021, King & Spalding is now within $70,000 of Gibson’s PPEP figure. (Over the same period, Gibson grew PPEP by just 8%.)

But regardless of the exact motivations, the defections of Mastro and Kirsch cast a spotlight on an important difference between the two firms: whereas Gibson requires partners to step down from its executive committee at 65 and to give up equity status at 68, King & Spalding has no mandatory partner retirement age. Mastro and Kirsch left Gibson at ages 65 and 60, respectively. Mastro, a longtime member of the executive committee, was already confronting the effects of Gibson’s retirement policy, and Kirsch could have been vulnerable to forced retirement in the coming years.

The traditional retirement model is less relevant today

Roughly half of Am Law 200 firms have mandatory retirement, with most specifying ages in the range of 63 to 68. Protocols for handling the retirement process vary. Some firms will transition partners into counsel positions as an intermediate step, enabling them to continue practicing while transferring their clients and work to younger partner colleagues. Others broach the topic of the impending retirement a year or two in advance to ease the partner’s transition out of the firm. It must be noted that retirement policies are often applied selectively, even at firms that supposedly have an age threshold. For example, there appear to be at least 23 Gibson Dunn partners who are over the age of 68, notwithstanding the firm’s mandatory retirement rules.

Traditionally, mandatory retirement has played an important role in career development for mid-career partners. When senior partners depart, it opens leadership positions for the next generation and enables younger partners to inherit primary responsibility for lucrative clients. However, an important premise of this model was that senior partners would, at least grudgingly, agree to transfer their clients. In a world of substantially increased partner lateral movement, this is no longer a safe assumption. As Mastro and Kirsch illustrate, partners over 60 with a robust book of business have attractive alternative options, and they need not acquiesce to a retirement plan that doesn’t suit them.

The other important function that mandatory retirement historically played was to help firms cull partners whose declining productivity no longer merited their high compensation. Stepping down due to age enabled a more graceful departure than being pushed out explicitly in response to diminished revenue production. But in the current environment, with the decline of lockstep partner compensation and an accelerating shift towards a pay-for-performance model, firms are not waiting until age 65 to push out unproductive partners. As a result, partners who still have equity in their mid-60s are much more likely to be important revenue contributors than in the past.

Potential lateral destinations: an initial screen

So if you are a partner of a certain vintage confronting impending mandatory retirement and are not yet ready to step aside, where else might you consider? Naturally, this will depend on a number of factors specific to your practice and your book of business. But as an initial screen, it may be helpful to highlight firms that — purely by the numbers — have demonstrated a particular willingness to retain partners beyond the age of 65.

To that end, we analyzed the number of partners at each Am Law 200 firm who received their JD in 1981 or earlier. The logic for selecting 1981 is that, assuming each attorney was at least 25 years old in the year of JD graduation, all partners in this data set should now be older than 65. For each firm, we divided the partners in this set by the total number of partners, thereby estimating the proportion of the firm’s partnership comprising members age 65+. Firms with a higher proportion of these seniormost partners may be especially receptive to considering potential lateral partners who are approaching mandatory retirement at their current firm.

We estimate that there are 12 Am Law 200 firms with at least 5% of the partnership aged 65+:

Firm	% of Partnership Aged 65+
Irell & Manella	15%
Buckley	11%
Patterson, Belknap	8%
Stroock & Stroock & Lavan	6%
Herrick, Feinstein	6%
Boies Schiller	5%
Cahill Gordon	5%
Hughes Hubbard	5%
Kasowitz Benson	5%
Munger, Tolles	5%
Sullivan & Worcester	5%
Susman Godfrey	5%
The pension factor

A frequent complicating factor in considering the viability of late-stage lateral moves is the potential loss of a pension. Partners may understandably view their pension as a set of golden handcuffs: having spent so many years accumulating pension credits, does it make sense to walk away now?

In some cases, the answer will indeed be no. But it’s important to recognize that the pension issue is surmountable, at least sometimes. Gibson Dunn is known for its generous pension package, but Mastro and Kirsch departed regardless. For a partner with a strong book of business, there is a good chance a competing firm will be prepared to offer a package that adequately compensates for loss of an accumulated pension.

***

# Getting Out Of The Kitchen
## This will not be the last time an erstwhile trademark enforcer will be bounced out of the kitchen.

The emotional aspect of IP enforcement can never be overstated, especially among the creative types that help drive our economy and society forward. What is true for the IP owners trying to assert their rights is also just as true for those finding themselves the enforcement targets, a dynamic which makes our little slice of the legal profession so interesting and exciting to practice in. And as we have seen [before](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/taco-tuesday-trademark-triangle/), adding in a little bit of celebrity spice will often help drive an IP enforcement tale into the mainstream media, particularly when the issues involved are connected to branding around familiar products.

In just the latest example, the past week has seen hardcore IP media outlets like the [Today](https://www.today.com/food/news/david-chang-momofuku-chili-crunch-trademark-controversy-rcna146564) show focus in on celebrity chef (and [previous](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/cooking-up-ip-literacy/) star of this column) David Chang’s abortive attempt at assertion of a “Chile Crunch” trademark in connection with his popular Momofuku[ Chili Crunch](https://shop.momofuku.com/products/chili-crunch) chili oil. What probably was thought of as a routine sending of cease and desist letters to comply with the requirement of trademark owners to police their marks took a nasty turn, with allegations of [cultural misappropriation ](https://www.instagram.com/p/C5WZ3HJOmX7/?img_index=1)and threats of boycott presaging a public apology by [Chang ](https://www.eater.com/24128813/dave-chang-momofuku-trademark-enforcement-chile-crunch-debacle-response-explained)in short order.

As is often the case, the story actually starts a lot earlier. For one, this is not the first time that Momufuku has turned to IP lawyers to help preserve its rights. In 2022, it sent a number of cease and desist letters to a competitor restaurant business, Yuzu Kitchen, based on Yuzu’s use of a peach logo that Momofuku — which translates to “lucky peach” — took offense to. Those letters were followed by a complaint filed in the SDNY, but the case settled before any substantive action took place. Still, my column summarizing a Chang podcast from a year later noted Chang’s expressed “frustration at what he calls the ‘rampant theft’ in the food industry, which he compares to the struggles that fashion houses have in dealing with ‘fast fashion’ competitors like Zara and others.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
That frustration may have also been informed  by Chang’s experience on the receiving end of IP assertion. Also in 2022, Chang saw Momufuku’s Chili Crunch product, which was launched in 2020, the subject of a trademark lawsuit of its own. Chile Colonial, the owner of a registered “Chile Crunch” mark, filed a District of Colorado lawsuit against Momofuku in late August 2022, only to see Momofuku purchase that mark in settlement in March 2023. A year later, the company[ filed ](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=98475401&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch)a trademark application for the “Chili Crunch” mark as well, in parallel with the sending of cease and desist letters to a set of companies selling Chili Crunch products, with the majority of recipients “small brands founded by Asian Americans.”

The backlash was immediate, with Chang finding himself branded a [trademark bully](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/04/chili-crunch-trademark-momofuku-david-chang), with a lawyer for one of the letter recipients accusing him of “picking on small businesses with a letter campaign hoping they’ll cave because of the financial pressure.” Making matters worse, Chang was accused by his fellow Asian American food purveyors of delivering a “punch in the gut” through his legal action.

Initially, Momofuku tried to counter the charges by explaining that it had to take action due to the legal requirement that trademark owners police their marks. That explanation, while legally correct, was not well-received by those complaining about the situation. As a result, the company was forced to acknowledge that the “situation has created a painful divide between Momofuku, the AAPI community we care deeply about, and other companies sharing grocery store shelves. But the truth is, we all want the same things: to grow, to succeed and to make America’s pantries and grocery stores a more diverse place.”

Once again, Chang found himself let down by the legal process when it came to IP issues. Not only was he forced to purchase the trademark to protect himself, but he was unable to utilize the mark he purchased to position his company’s interests in a more favorable way from a trademark perspective. Under the circumstances, what I wrote about his IP comments last year rings true — namely, that Chang’s “status as an IP owner has not cooled his frustration at the lack of respect for IP in the food industry […] especially when he sees innovators in other industries rewarded through workable mechanisms for balancing access to IP protected material and the need to foster additional innovation.” At the same time, there should have been at least some expectation on his end that targeting small businesses owned by others sharing his ethnic background might have met a cool reception in the court of public opinion.

Ultimately, it is hard not to sympathize with a business owner like Chang, who has already been upfront about his struggles in navigating the complex IP legal landscape. Thankfully for him, however, he can afford high-quality legal representation, as well the full menu of legal options available to protect his rights on both the offensive and defensive sides of the IP ledger. For smaller companies in his industry, be they other restaurants or food wholesalers, that same luxury is not available. But as seen in the Chili Crunch conflagration, the power of the public can’t be underestimated — and in fact can act as a great equalizer for those facing aggressive action at the hands of a trademark bully. This will not be the last time an erstwhile trademark enforcer will be bounced out of the kitchen.

# Suicide In The Legal Profession Is All 'Too Common' A Story
## Mental health in Biglaw is something everyone needs to care about.

Ian was no different from you—a brilliant, driven, professional struggling internally to meet the demands of work he loved and feeling unable to seek help because of intense fear around the stigma of mild mental health issues and diabetes. His story is also not too different from that of countless men (mostly) and women in the law who have also taken their own lives. He was coping reasonably well until suddenly he wasn’t, and it was too late. This “he just snapped” phenomenon is all too common, and I promise that you are not immune to it.

—Dr. Marny Morrison Turvill, widow of legal marketer [Ian Turvill](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/amid-recent-suicides-biglaw-staff-members-wonder-when-their-mental-health-moment-will-come/) who died by suicide two years ago, [writing for Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/01/10/ian-was-no-different-from-you-wife-says-legal-marketers-suicide-is-a-lesson-in-addressing-mental-health-challenges/) about her husband’s mental health issues that led to his death. She says that the culture at Biglaw firms can prevent folks who need help from seeking it. Turvill also says a change in paradigms in the understanding of mental health is necessary to truly address the problem.

If you or someone you know is depressed and in need help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) or a lawyer assistance program in your state
