# Biglaw Firm Reminds Attorneys They Need To Respond To Clients Even Though There's A Pandemic
## Responding to clients, it's still a thing.

Lots of things in Biglaw have changed as a result of COVID-19. Offices are[ closing until 2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/am-law-50-firm-extends-mandatory-work-from-home-policy-though-january-2021/), [partners and associates are sharing offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-firm-tells-partners-to-share-their-offices-with-associates/),[ salaries are being slashed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-covid-crisis-law-firm-layoff-tracker-whats-your-firm-doing-to-survive/), [partners are getting forced out of firms ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-partners-are-getting-forced-out-of-their-firms/)— it’s a different world out there. But one thing that has remained constant is that it’s a demanding job.

Part of what makes Biglaw so stressful are the demands that clients make of their attorneys. And though there’s a lot that firms can/should do to improve their work environment, the needs of clients aren’t really something they can change; it’s just sort of a given.

And the management committee at Fisher Phillips wants everyone to know it.

According to sources at the firm, an email from leadership went out with an ominous subject line, A WAKE-UP CALL, last week. The timing was… not great, as a tipster notes:

[T]he management committee sent this today right at the beginning of the school year, middle of a pandemic, and right after a hurricane which directly impacts several firm offices.

It’s true there’s a lot that folks are dealing with right now, and the messaging from the firm tries to be be cognizant of that. But it also seems like several balls were dropped across the firm:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
This week I have heard several reports of client relationships at risk because some Fisher Phillips lawyer failed to return emails of phone calls after several client attempts. I am hesitant to be too harsh about this given the extraordinary challenges everyone is facing. On the other hand, I cannot overstate how much our firm’s brand and ability to have desirable clients and work depends on our hard-earned reputation as the super-responsive, client-focused law firm.

The email goes on to ask all attorneys to be “scrupulously attentive and responsive external and internal client communications” and to “rededicate” themselves to the Fisher Phillips brand. It’s a hard message to hear amid a pandemic, but better to get it from firm management before clients start leaving.

# Being Pregnant While Gunning For Partner
## Trust that your colleagues and clients can handle it if you want to disclose your pregnancy. Be candid about what you need while pregnant -- don’t make your colleagues guess.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on motherhood in the legal profession, in partnership with our friends at [MothersEsquire](https://www.mothersesquire.com/). Welcome Sarah-Jane Morin to our pages.

It was a big day.  My black maternity pantsuit was making its debut, stretchy waistband in all its glory.  I turned to the side and looked in the mirror.  I turned back to face the mirror.  Side again.  Front again.  Repeat.  Did I look pregnant?  Nah, I decided.  I looked like an attorney dressed to be elevated to partner — assuming I made it through the partnership interview at my law firm’s headquarters that day.

I had not yet told my firm management that I was pregnant.  I had decided that it was better to be private for now.  Muddying the waters while up for partner seemed unnecessary; the better path seemed to be to let the partnership decision be made first, and then I could discuss my family plans.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Opting to stay silent made pregnancy complicated, perhaps unnecessarily so in hindsight.  I travel a fair amount to see clients and to speak at conferences.  My colleagues traveling with me would go to dinner or drinks after the meetings or conferences, whereas I needed to sleep (I was exhausted).  That meant I often excused myself to go “work.”  The secrecy felt awful, yet I felt that I couldn’t risk being more straightforward, nor did it seem appropriate to discuss my personal life in those moments.

Making my way up the elevator and down the hall to the partnership interview, I didn’t feel physically great.  Morning sickness?  Nerves?  Probably both.  But once I was in the room, I felt so excited.  I forgot about everything but the interview and the moment.  It was over so quickly.  I went home and breathed a sigh of relief, knowing I had done my best.

A few days after the interview, a colleague called me to let me know that there were some rumors going around the proverbial water cooler that I was pregnant.  Hm, maybe my maternity suit was not as incognito as I had thought.  I decided to call the head of my department immediately and let him know that I was pregnant.  I hated the idea that the firm would find out from anyone other than me.  I knew of no other partners who had been pregnant while up for partner and could not anticipate the reaction from my firm.  Picking up the phone, I was extremely nervous.  What would he say?  Would he be angry that I hadn’t said something before?  Would the firm assume I would not want to travel anymore or not want to step up for new client pitches, neither of which would be a correct assumption?

I decided the best path to handle my nerves and these questions was to be straightforward and clear.  I was not apologetic or cagey.  My fears turned out to be unfounded.  My department head congratulated me, told me that the firm was invested in me for the long haul, and that this was great news.  He told me that my pregnancy had no bearing on new assignments and that I should tell him if I needed anything.  A huge weight was lifted from my shoulders, and I felt grateful and happy.  Across the firm, I was met with similar reactions.  The head of my firm put me in touch with a small group of female partners who had babies.  I had never known such a group existed, and I wished I had known much earlier that this support was available.  About two weeks later, the firm announced its new class of partners, and I was honored to be included.  It turns out I was actually one of two rising pregnant partners!

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
After that, I was left with the complications of working while a rising partner and being pregnant.  The complications were difficult: I had to excuse myself from a call with a client when I got sick (thank you to a wonderful associate who didn’t miss a beat in stepping in); due to some pregnancy complications, by my third trimester I had five doctor appointments per week (thank goodness for the technology that gave me the ability to work remotely).  Perhaps most difficult: I missed the firm’s yearly partnership meeting because it was scheduled a week after my due date.  I was sad to miss it but appreciated that my firm management told me not to worry and to enjoy my time at home with my new son.  There is always the next one.

If I could do it over again, I would still remain quiet until I felt comfortable revealing my pregnancy after the partnership interview.  Pregnancy — especially the first half — can be physically and emotionally taxing as well as scary at times, and felt very private to me.  But my choice might not be right for others, and I see now that pregnancy would not (and certainly should not) have upset my partnership prospects or muddied the waters — especially if I were to be clear that my first priorities were health and work (so no, I did not need any special accommodations; I could travel while pregnant, etc.).  If you find yourself debating the merits of discretion versus full disclosure in similar circumstances, do what feels right for you in your situation.  Trust that your colleagues and clients can handle it if you want to disclose your pregnancy.  Be candid about what you need while pregnant – don’t make your colleagues guess.  Being pregnant while up for a promotion is not a taboo issue, and we don’t need to treat it as such.

# Stealth Layoffs And Shortchanging Associates
## A sign of things to come?

While reports say law firms are still killing it out there, law firm leaders have already expressed [deep concern over the economic outlook](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/law-firm-leaders-think-its-about-time-to-completely-freak-out/). Could firms be staring down another massive recession? Well, if history is any guide, the first harbinger of troubling economic times will be the stealth layoffs — a string of departures chalked up to vague “performance issues” designed to clear the decks while arousing minimal attention.

At this point, we don’t have enough intel from tipsters to confirm what’s going on at this particular firm, but if this blind item sounds like your firm, please let us know with a confidential email to tips@abovethelaw.com. Don’t worry, we’re not going to reveal our sources.

The whispers we’ve heard is that a top global law firm is quietly laying off attorneys in the United States after failing to secure a merger partner last year. If true, this could reflect a botched growth strategy because as recently as a few months ago, the firm was expanding in its U.S. presence.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Beyond the layoffs, one tipster suggests the firm is shortchanging the associates it is keeping on the payroll. According to this report, some attorneys are being docked class years when it comes to pay while still being billed out at their actual seniority. That would just be a naked profit grab. This tipster said some attorneys were being docked as much as two classes. A fifth-year getting knocked back down to a third-year would be a $60K pay cut.

As we said, with only anonymous tips so far, we can’t definitively say that this is a firm policy as opposed to isolated incidents that might have an innocent explanation. But if a major firm is already walking down this road, could an industry-wide rough patch be far behind?

Since we broke the news of the new $200K salary scale for associates at large law firms in the United States — a trend that was [started by Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) on Thursday, June 10, 2021, almost exactly three years after the firm started the last salary war in 2018 — several firms have fallen in line and matched the scale, but dozens more firms have remained completely silent. Maybe this Above the Law feature will encourage more firms to pay up. After all, the postpandemic lateral scene is white-hot right now, and increased salaries will only encourage talent to remain loyal to their firms.

Today, we unveil a table of all of the firms that have already matched the new salary scale (or instituted raises, generally, because of the new salary scale), the date those matches were made, and whether special bonuses were offered earlier this spring (so you can see where firms truly stand) for your viewing pleasure. We will be updating this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as news on raises unfolds. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs further clarification, let us know.

At a corporation, you’re supposed to be nice.

(This is quite a challenge for some of us.)

You’re supposed to support corporate initiatives and build esprit de corps.  You’re supposed to engage the troops.

Law firms don’t worry about that crap.

At a corporation, you hear people say:  “[Jarndyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarndyce_and_Jarndyce) is a good lawyer.  But he was criticizing our in-house training program for executives.  I’m not sure we want someone around who has that kind of attitude.”

Or:  “Jarndyce negotiates a pretty good deal.  But he was awfully abrupt with opposing counsel on the last transaction.  I think he needs coaching.”

Or:  “Jarndyce is much too self-centered.  He just sits in his office and gets his work done.  He never strolls the floors, chatting with others.  That’s not really the right attitude.”

Or:  “Jarndyce occasionally seems unhappy with his job.  That’s his fault.  At this organization, you’re responsible for your own engagement.  If you’re not engaged, it’s your fault.  Maybe it’s time to let Jarndyce go.”

Folks who work at corporations understand what I mean.

Folks who work at law firms think I must be making this stuff up.

At a law firm, you hear:  “Jarndyce is a great thinker!  She comes up with arguments that most people miss.  She writes extraordinarily well.  She’s good on her feet.  And she’s started to bring in some clients.  Make her a partner!”

She may have the personality of [Vlad the Impaler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler), but no one really cares.  For the most part, firms are judging people on their legal (and business development) skills, and no one worries about the rest.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
There are reasons for this:  Lawyers at firms (generally) are billing time.  Lawyers at corporations (generally) are not.  “Strolling the floor, chatting with others” doesn’t have an ABA billing code.  It thus constitutes “vacation” at a law firm.  At a corporation, it constitutes “work.”  There’s no surprise that people do more of it at corporations.

Additionally, cynicism (I’d call it realism, but someone would think I was being cynical) is almost expected at law firms.  Lawyers worry about which practices are declining, who’s not pulling his weight, what can go wrong, and so forth.  This is instilled in a lawyer’s training and reinforced by a lawyer’s life.  

You might hear this at a law firm:  “We’re set:  [Summerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Summerson) told me he’d send the client a note.”  “Did he actually send it?”  “He said he would.”  “So what?  Until you see it go, that’s just a promise.  And it’s probably a promise that Summerson is breaking.  Confirm that the note actually went.”  That’s either being a compulsive nutcase or being a lawyer who’s practiced for a couple of decades. 

People, as opposed to lawyers, aren’t like that.  They assume that Summerson sent the note.  People want to know that they’re working at the very best corporation in the world.  They want to know that it’s 72 degrees and sunny.  They want to know that everything’s going swimmingly and, incredibly, things will go even better tomorrow.

In other words, they’re nuts.

But, as odd as this may seem to lawyers, that’s the world.

If you feel comfortable living in a world of realists, and you prefer not to sit around singing [Kumbaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbaya) all the time, then stay at your law firm, for heaven’s sake.  Your personality fits the joint.

But if your law firm feels a bit icy to you — people don’t stop to chat or take an interest in your personal life — consider making a move.

There may be places that don’t fit the stereotypes but, for the most part, law firms cater to lawyers, and corporations cater to people.

# 3 Questions For A Litigation Finance Chronicler (Part I)
## Litigation finance’s progression toward acceptance as a mature asset class continues apace.

There is no lack of attention on developments in the litigation finance space, just as there is no lack of developments in the litigation finance space to pay attention to. Whether it is [Reuters’ coverage](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/mishcon-de-reya-teams-up-with-litigation-funder-harbour-new-venture-2021-09-08/) from early September of an interesting funder/law firm collaboration or a [Bloomberg Law article](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/longford-capitals-250-million-closes-litigation-finance-fund) about the closing of yet another big-dollar fund by one of the industry’s more prominent pure-play funders, litigation finance news abounds. Add in the occasional discussion of industry developments by the likes of the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/41a45565-e49f-4c0c-a7a4-e61765f15e66) and it is clear that litigation finance’s progression toward acceptance as a mature asset class continues apace. At the same time, there is always room for consistent, focused, industry-specific coverage in any business area, so it is also heartening to see that a new weekly newsletter promising to make sure that readers are “caught up on all that is happening in the litigation finance market” has started to make inroads as a dedicated source of litigation finance news.

Started by a Canadian chartered accountant with deep experience in coverage of the insolvency area, Litigation Finance Insider (LFI) is a new online publication dedicated to the litigation finance market. Led by editor [Henry Louis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-louis-124a4a64/), the LFI team writes about new cases being funded, industry trends and insights, as well as analysis of funder performance and firm news. Henry launched the publication earlier this year with the goal of giving legal professionals, investors, and other interested individuals an inside look at this fast-growing corner of the legal space. I first spoke to Henry over the summer and have since found LFI a worthy weekly read, containing as it does both a recap of litigation finance-related news as well as a healthy set of job listings for those looking to get into the litigation finance game. In short, LFI already does a nice job of providing a timely look at the state of play in the litigation finance industry, and I have every expectation that Henry and the LFI team will mirror the growth of litigation finance in terms of the scale and quality of their content going forward.

In light of the above, I am very pleased to share with this audience a written interview I did with Henry, who was gracious enough to agree despite his busy schedule around the LF Dealmakers Forum that I teased on these [pages](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/on-the-agenda/). Between dedicated industry coverage sources like LFI and industry-focused conferences like [LF Dealmakers](https://lf.dealmakersforums.com/), there is no doubt that the litigation finance train continues to barrel along the tracks — and thus continues to command the attention of IP litigators and their clients, as I imagine it will for a long time to come.

Now to the interview. As usual, I have added some brief commentary to Henry’s answer below but have otherwise presented his answer to my first question as he provided it.

Gaston Kroub: Where do you see the litigation funding industry heading over the next few years?

Henry Louis: The litigation finance industry in the United States has grown tremendously in the last fifteen years and will without question become an even bigger part of the litigation landscape in the future.

The influx of capital into the space and the increasing levels of sophistication of the industry will create more options for plaintiffs looking for case funding. New funders will emerge that will be dedicated to specific niches, such as insolvency or construction or intellectual property, or are focused on a specific investment type, such as the enforcement of awards.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I think we’ll also start to see law firms offering their own funding solutions to clients, either on their own or in partnership with litigation funders. We’re already starting to see this — in June, Longford Capital announced that they had entered into a $50 million funding agreement with the Chicago office of international law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP.

With the rise of funding options will come the challenge of picking the right solution and the right terms for a funding deal — for this reason I see the role of litigation finance brokers and advisors growing in importance in the coming years.

Regulation is also something that the industry will also have to grapple with, as any new and fast growing industry does. The current hot topic in the U.S. right now are rules around disclosure. Earlier this year, the State of New Jersey joined a few other U.S. jurisdictions in requiring disclosure of third-party funding information. Whether other states will follow suit and what impact this will have on funding levels and litigation tactics remains to be seen.

GK: As someone who shares Henry’s bullish views on the prospects for the litigation finance industry, it is hard to take issue with any of his predictions. I agree that we are likely to see additional launches of litigation funding firms, as sophisticated investors continue to realize the potential for significant returns in the space. And with the rise of a greater variety of funding options, the role of brokers will surely increase, just as more law firms will find themselves drawn to forming deeper relationships with existing funders. I fully expect LFI to keep us abreast of any developments on those fronts, as well as with regard to regulatory issues as they arise.

Next week, we will hear from Henry about why he thinks learning about litigation finance is an important step for U.S. law firms as well as his thoughts on what critical misconception around litigation finance calls out for correction. In the interim, you can sign up for LFI’s free weekly emails [here](https://litigationfinanceinsider.com/).

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://www.laterallink.com) team of expert contributors. [Wendy Boone Jaikaran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendy-boone-jaikaran-467942a/) is a Director based in the Houston office where she focuses on associate, counsel, and partner placements in the Texas market with leading AmLaw firms and high-end boutiques. Prior to joining the company, Wendy was a Senior Partner with a national recruiting firm. Wendy started her career as an IP litigation associate at a well-respected IP boutique in Houston. She received her J.D. from Thurgood Marshall School of Law and her B.S. in advertising from The University of Texas at Austin.

I had a chance to sit down with one of the most interesting lawyers in Texas, my aunt, Ms. Danielle Joy “DJ” Healey.  DJ, formerly known as David Healey, is a well-known and respected intellectual property litigation attorney in Houston, where she is a Senior Principal at Fish & Richardson.

DJ was recently in the headlines when she announced she was transgender and made the decision to live as a woman.  With the help of her firm, DJ announced her transition to her firm and clients in July 2017.

“They ultimately worked with me and put together a plan on how to do this and how to notify people,” she said.  “They put an enormous amount of effort and time and energy into it.  It shows that the Fish family is really a family.”

While her transition has recently been big news in the legal community, there is much more to DJ.  DJ is one of the top-rated intellectual property attorneys in the U.S.  Some of her recognitions include being recognized as an “IP Star” by Managing Intellectual Property (2013-2017); listed in “The World’s Leading Patent Litigators” since 2011 by Intellectual Asset Management; ranked for Intellectual Property by Chambers Global since 2008; and listed in Best Lawyers in America, to name a few.

Did you know that DJ was the Executive Producer of a major motion picture?   A few years ago, DJ wrote a book called Kindness for the Damned, which she later made into a movie called [Leaves of the Tree](http://leavesofthetreethemovie.com/).  The movie starred Eric Roberts and was a huge success.  It has been recognized at numerous film festivals across the world.

Lucky for us, DJ agreed to let me interview her regarding her past achievements and recent announcement.


DJ Healey

How did you get into patent law?

I was a trial lawyer at a national law firm. In the early 1990s, patent litigation exploded and I was recruited by Arnold, White and Durkee, which was then a patent powerhouse, to boost their trial capacity.

Why did you ultimately make the transition to be transgender?

Being transgender is a physical condition that I fought for many years. As I got older, I realized this is who I am, I learned to accept myself, and eventually I had to live my truth without shame or secrecy to survive. I am the same person I have always been, and I hope other people will see me as the same person and same lawyer they have known for decades.

How did Fish & Richardson handle the transition?

Fish is a family. And like my own family, Fish embraced me and supported me throughout my transition. They worked with me to make a plan that provided for coordination of my announcement, outreach to clients and colleagues, and meetings for co-workers to field questions. With Fish’s support, my colleagues and clients were able to see I am the same person and the same lawyer I have always been, and I have had tremendous support from everyone. Fish continues to support me in my efforts to show people I am still a go-to lawyer. Fish’s handling of my transition shows how by embracing inclusion and diversity you build the best team: that by doing right, you also do well.

How has the transition positively or negatively affected your legal career?

It has been a huge positive for my life, which makes it positive for my career. I have been released from the background noise of suppressed feelings, and now am focused on patent litigation full force. I have also developed a renewed commitment to pro bono civil rights work. I firmly believe we are a stronger, better, and more prosperous society when we embrace each other and refuse to allow hate to divide us.

What made you decide to make a movie?

I am not and never have been in the movie business. My family and I made our movie out of passion for our specific project: a story of family and healing I had written during a serious illness several years ago. This was a one-time labor of love that I will always be proud of, but I am a patent litigator, not a movie producer.

What has been the biggest triumph in your legal career?

Recently, in WesternGeco v. ION, I was able to come in for ION after it lost a verdict for patent infringement and damages to eliminate hundreds of millions of dollars of exposure to supplemental and enhanced damages. We also eliminated nearly $100 million in lost profits damages on appeal, which is now the subject of a pending petition for certiorari at the Supreme Court. I have had other big wins in the past, including In re Alcatel, the seminal Texas Supreme Court case on Apex depositions (the deposition of high-ranking corporate officers); a confidential arbitration award over telecom patent royalties where my client prevailed against a claim for over $400 million; and a confidential settlement in a medical device case that I believe remains one of the largest patent infringement settlements in Texas.

# Am Law 100 Firm Defers Making Offers To Current Summer Associates Until 2024
## This waiting game is not going to be pretty for law students.

Thanks to drastic changes in client demand, quite a few Biglaw firms have opted to defer their incoming associate classes to January 2024. But now, an Am Law 100 firm is putting a whole new twist on the deferral, and this time, current law students will bear the brunt of the decision.

Global immigration giant Fragomen — a firm that brought in $947,647,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it in 56th place on the Am Law 100, and making it the 75th highest grossing firm in the world per the Global 200 — has chosen to defer making offers to its current summer associates until early 2024. Yikes. Making third-year law students wait that long to find out whether they’ll need to scramble to find a job is insensitive and inconsiderate, to say the very least.

Salvador Malo, Fragomen’s chief people officer, offered the following statement to the American Lawyer:

[  ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
[Sponsored](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“As our hiring practices—whether for summer associates or other legal and professional staff—follow client needs and immigration policy changes around the world, we do not make blanket offers each year at the end of our summer associate program. We extended offers in 2022 and have informed the current class that we will be making decisions in early 2024 when client needs can be assessed more accurately.”

Fragomen did not offer comment on whether the firm has made law students wait to receive offers beyond the end of the summer in years past. Over on Fishbowl, one summer associate said they were “no offered due to ‘financial reasons’ and told to reach back out in 2024.”

Unfortunately, the tides have turned for those seeking H-1Bs, with applications vastly over the current limit of 85,000 visas. For Fragomen, this spells trouble thanks to the unavailability of H-1B cap-subject petitions. This has led to layoffs and job losses across the country in a number of industries, [including the legal profession](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/h1b-visas-goodwin/).

Meanwhile, the firm boosted its head count by 20.2% over the course of 2022, and now has about 6,000 total employees across the globe. Last year, Fragomen hosted its largest summer associate class ever (76). The firm posted its [2024 hiring notice for summer associates](https://fragomen.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/FragomenCareers/job/Summer-Associate_REQ-019272) just two days ago, which contains the following language: “This is not a traditional Summer Associate Program. Associate offers are contingent on performance, future business needs and are not guaranteed.”

Greenburg Traurig’s [Mathew Rosengart](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/r/rosengart-mathew-s) has finally broken the Satan spell that kept Britney Spears laboring under a conservatorship for the seeming benefit of everyone except her. For that, he deserves every bit of professional praise he’s getting.

Meanwhile, there’s this shit.

Biglaw attorney heartthrobs is where we draw the line.

Rosengod, working hard! [#FreeBritney](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreeBritney?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)[https://t.co/X1WsDybV6i](https://t.co/X1WsDybV6i)

No, never mind, “Rosengod” is where we draw the line.

Hero worshipping lawyers has never really been our thing here. Well, it [has been our thing here](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/05/prosecutors-run-amok-an-interview-with-sidney-powell-author-of-licensed-to-lie/), but not for a long time. Rosengart, a former David Souter clerk from the judge’s pre-SCOTUS days, is a famed Hollywood lawyer but, not to besmirch his record, it seems as though any lawyer with a modicum of will could’ve obliterated this flimsy conservatorship. We can appreciate what he’s pulled off without veering into idolatry, can’t we?

“He’s very dominant,” Nouri says. “Just the way he speaks, it’s like, ‘Oh yes, Daddy.’ I think that’s why people love him because he is getting the job done and he just has this aura of power.”

Because what Britney needs right now is definitely a daddy figure.

Donald Trump

Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment — by the way, and if she gets to pick — if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dunno.

— Republican presidential nominee [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump), speaking at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, and implying in an off-the-cuff remark that the only way to prevent his Democratic opponent [Hillary Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton) from nominating liberal jurists for seats on the Supreme Court would be for [gun rights advocates to commit acts of violence](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0) against her.

# Innovation In Law: An Oxymoron?
## Change doesn’t always come easy, but it’s worth it in the end.

Some of the most intelligent, interesting, and high-achieving people I know are lawyers. Yet, few people would describe most law firms as anything close to “innovative.”

In my lifelong quest to encourage innovation in law, I had a conversation with Alicia Ryan, who leads the practice innovation group at Fenwick and West. She left her high stakes M&A practice to help a law firm embrace 21st century technology and social trends, developments, and innovations. According to Alicia, there are well-known historic and systemic reasons for the slower rate of innovation in law firms.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

She explains, “For one, some law firms can lack disruptive competition. The billable hour model can also make things challenging. And then there’s the culture of ‘following the precedent.’” Alicia believes that new market realities are coming to law firms. According to Alicia, “The need to innovate at law firms is real. And, many folks are increasingly engaged on the subject.”

So, if you want to further the innovation effort at your firm, here are some of the best practices, according to Alicia, for getting around the institutional barriers to innovation that we all face as lawyers.

Create a Sense of Urgency

Alicia is convinced that change won’t happen unless people believe it is necessary. She explains, “New market forces are on your side and can make this an organic process.”

So, where to start? Alicia recommends talking to the people in your firm who are close to the “pain.” “Those in finance or client marketing face challenges firsthand,” she explains. She advises to “find out which practice groups or tasks are facing the most price pressure. Find out which of your peer firms are innovating and whether those innovations are viewed by partners or management as competitive threats.”

According to Alicia, if you go through this exercise, you’ll learn where innovation efforts can be most impactful. That is also where they will be more eagerly received. It’s where you’ll find more enthusiasm and open minds. Most importantly, “You’ll also learn which executives or partners are likely to champion which types of efforts,” Alicia says.

Allocate Adequate Staff Resources – Time & Expertise

Once you’ve got buy-in and a partner champion for your innovation project — like bringing on a new AI tool or piloting a robotic process automation (RPA) initiative (yes, think big!), you may think you’re ready to go. But Alicia cautions, “Don’t underestimate how high-touch managing innovative change can be! People want to see the change, but also are afraid of uncertainty and risk.”

Alicia advises to actively hold hands and manage expectations throughout the entire process. “Sending a few emails with instructions and some marketing blurbs won’t generate usage and adoption,” she explains. According to Alicia, “You’ll need staff resources and experts for whom this is a priority. They’ll need training and a mandate to stick with the project and be a resource for users for the first year of its use.”

Incentivize People to Help

Alicia explains, “It goes against human nature, especially the nature of humans who bill by the hour, to work more slowly NOW in order to go faster LATER.” But according to her, your communication plan will clarify this as you outline the vision and goals while highlighting successes.

But how can you really get people motivated to learn a new tool or update a form document? Alicia explains, “In the former case, we’ve seen peer presentations have a powerful effect. When associates who are proponents of a new tool or process present their experiences to the rest of the group firsthand, others want to get on board.”

“In many cases, your efforts will be more fruitful if you can get a bucket of billable credit hours approved in advance,” she notes. Make sure you rally up a big army of people to help. Alicia explains, “Need associates to help create and maintain forms for the corporate group? Offer some billable credit for that work. It’s an incentive, but it’s also about removing obstacles. Find out what keeps people from driving or adopting change, and start chipping away at those obstacles.”

Innovation doesn’t have to be slow and painful. It doesn’t have to be painful at all. It is a tremendous opportunity and a huge benefit to a profession that can be stuck in its ways. In fact, the greatest challenges of innovation in law may have nothing to do with innovation itself, but in convincing the risk-averse professionals of its benefits.

That’s where you come in. Arm yourself with knowledge, open-mindedness, and stubbornness to meet the stubbornness of those around you. Change doesn’t always come easy, but it’s worth it in the end! Please let me know if you have other tips for innovating in law. I would love to share with everyone.

# World's Largest Law Firm Announces Biggest Pandemic Combination Yet
## Which law firm has the Biglaw behemoth gobbled up this time?

A pandemic doesn’t seem like the best time for a combination, but that’s not going to keep the largest law firm in the world from expanding its enormous footprint. This is the biggest combination that’s been announced since the coronavirus crisis began, but for Dentons, that’s par for the course.

When we last checked in with the Biglaw behemoth, it had [closed two offices thanks to COVID](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/worlds-largest-law-firm-closes-two-offices-thanks-to-covid/), but now the firm is back on board with Project Golden Spike, where it’s combining with other successful entities to bring the Dentons name across the country. When all is said and done, Dentons aims to have 1,100 attorneys in the U.S., and today’s announcement will add another ~100 attorneys to the firm’s gigantic roster.

Dentons will be joining forces with Salt Lake City-based Durham Jones & Pinegar, one of the largest firms in Utah, to become the first global firm in the Beehive State. What else is so special about this combination? As noted in the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/11/dentons-makes-salt-lake-city-the-next-stop-in-u-s-expansion/), Durham Jones & Pinegar — or we should say Dentons Durham Jones Pinegar — will be able to work under the Dentons platform, but maintain control of its own governance, compensation, and hiring. Here are some details from the firm’s [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200811005449/en/Dentons-Combine-Durham-Jones-Pinegar-Utah):

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“We are excited to be combining with Dentons, a widely respected law firm that, like us, clearly prioritizes innovation and adaptability, especially during these extraordinary times,” said Todd Leishman, Chairman and President of Durham Jones & Pinegar. “Our combination with Dentons will allow our clients to continue to be served by lawyers they know and trust, who can now connect them to colleagues across the country and around the world.”

Building on Dentons’ global polycentric model, Project Golden Spike increases the quality and breadth of service to clients on a national and global scale, while also enabling US member firms like Durham Jones & Pinegar to retain their defining characteristics and provide in and of the community insight wherever clients need it.

“In times of accelerated change, the model of law firm combinations needs to continue to transform,” said Toby McClamroch, Managing Partner of Dentons United States Region. “Through the Golden Spike model and this combination with Durham Jones & Pinegar, Dentons is able to foster true collaboration between member firms and continue its trajectory to better serve clients across our focus on the 100 largest legal markets in the US.”

Upon the completion of this tie-up, Dentons will have a home in 188 locations — with 37 in the U.S. Which firm will be the next to get on board with the new business model presented by Dentons? We’ll soon see, because global chairman Joe Andrew says a few more U.S. firms will become part of the Dentons family by late 2020 or early 2021.

# Having A Seat At The Table Is Not Enough
## It is all about what a general counsel can do while occupying that seat.

In July, I wrote that [gone are the days when a seat at the table was a nice to have for a general counsel; it was now a must have](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/gone-are-the-days-when-a-seat-at-the-table-was-a-nice-to-have-it-is-now-a-must/). Having that seat, however, is only half the battle. To be successful in that seat, a GC must command significant authority, respect, and persuasive power within an organization or legal department in the form of influence. Influence in this context goes beyond merely having a high-ranking title; it involves the ability to shape decisions, strategies, and policies in legal matters and often extends to broader aspects of the organization’s operations.

Influence is crucial because it empowers the general counsel to be an effective advocate for legal compliance, risk management, and ethical behavior within the organization. Most importantly, it enables the GC to contribute meaningfully to the organization’s success.

How can influence enable a GC to contribute meaningfully to the organization’s success?

Effective Decision-Making: Legal considerations are often crucial in business decisions, such as mergers and acquisitions, contract negotiations, and compliance issues. By having influence, the GC can ensure that legal perspectives are considered, leading to more informed and legally sound decisions.

Risk Management: The GC is responsible for managing legal risks within the organization. Having influence means they can advocate for risk mitigation strategies and help the organization avoid costly legal disputes or regulatory penalties.

Cost Savings: By influencing decisions that impact the legal department, the GC can help manage legal costs more effectively. The GC can prioritize legal matters, negotiate favorable terms, and implement cost-efficient legal solutions.

Compliance and Ethics: Influence enables the GC to promote ethical behavior and ensure that the organization complies with laws and regulations. This is especially important in industries with strict compliance requirements, such as healthcare, finance, and environmental protection.

Protecting Reputation: An organization’s reputation is a valuable asset. The GC can use influence to guide the organization toward ethical and lawful practices, thereby protecting its reputation in the long run.

Building Trust: Having influence within an organization allows the GC to build trust with senior management, business leaders, and other stakeholders. This trust is essential for effective collaboration and problem-solving.

Strategic Planning: The GC can contribute to strategic planning by identifying legal risks and helping the organization navigate legal complexities and align legal strategies with overall business goals.

Conflict Resolution: The GC often plays a role in resolving disputes, both internal and external. Influence can help them mediate conflicts and find constructive solutions.

Stakeholder Relationships: Building influence allows GC to foster positive relationships with external stakeholders, such as regulatory bodies, external counsel, and industry peers. These relationships can be beneficial in various legal matters.

Building influence as the GC is essential for effectively fulfilling their role and contributing to the success of the organization. This influence can lead to greater involvement in decision-making processes and a more strategic role in the organization’s success. Here are some ways in which the GC can build influence.

Legal Expertise: Demonstrating a deep understanding of the law and its implications for the organization’s operations is essential. The GC who provides sound legal advice and solutions can earn the trust and build influence with colleagues and senior management.

Business Acumen: To be influential, the GC should not only understand the law but also the organization’s business. They should align their legal advice with the organization’s goals and objectives. This often involves understanding the industry, market dynamics, and the organization’s competitive landscape.

Communication Skills: Effective communication is key. The GC should be able to explain complex legal matters in a way that nonlawyers can understand. Clear and persuasive communication can help build credibility and influence.

Collaboration: Building strong working relationships with colleagues in different departments is crucial. Being seen as a collaborator rather than a roadblock to business initiatives can enhance influence. Working closely with other teams to find legal solutions that support the organization’s goals is a great way to build influence.

Ethical Behavior: Upholding high ethical standards is vital for the GC. Consistently demonstrating integrity and ethical behavior can enhance their reputation and influence within the organization.

Proactive Problem-Solving: The GC who anticipates legal issues before they become major problems and provides proactive solutions can demonstrate their value to the organization and build influence within it. Being seen as a problem solver rather than a problem identifier can be a significant asset.

Strategic Thinking: The general counsel who can think strategically and provide legal advice aligned with the organization’s long-term goals is often more influential. This involves understanding the broader business context and offering legal strategies that support the organization’s strategic direction.

Education and Training: Sharing legal knowledge and providing training to nonlegal staff can also be a way to build influence. When colleagues and management see the in-house lawyer as a resource for understanding legal matters, the GC’s influence can grow.

Risk Management: Effectively managing legal risks and helping the organization avoid costly legal disputes or regulatory issues can greatly enhance the GC’s influence. This includes developing risk-mitigation strategies and policies.

A GC who combines legal expertise with an understanding of the business, strong communication skills, and a proactive approach to problem-solving can build significant influence within the organizations. It is only with that influence that they can be most effective when taking a seat at the leadership table.

# Salary Wars Heat Up As Am Law 100 Firm Gets In On The Associate Raise Action
## More good news from the frontline of the salary wars.

Woohoo! It’s only been a day since the $215,000 associate compensation scale became a thing, and already we are seeing more firms making their own salary news.

The latest firm to announce raises for associates is Steptoe & Johnson, which made $393,914,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it 97th on the Am Law 100. They’ve matched the scale [announced by Milbank](//abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) yesterday. That means the firm will be working off of the now familiar salary scale below:

Class	Old Salary	New Salary
Class of 2021	$205K	$215K
Class of 2020	$215K	$225K
Class of 2019	$240K	$250K
Class of 2018	$275K	$285K
Class of 2017	$305K	$325K
Class of 2016	$330K	$350K
Class of 2015	$350K	$370K
Class of 2014+	$365K	$385K
Plus the firm announced additional discretionary bonuses, on top of the standard year-end ones:

The firm also will award discretionary bonuses, in addition to work effort bonuses, to those associates whose performance and financial contribution to the firm in 2021 substantially exceeded all expectations and most contributed to our success.

I’m sure that makes for some very happy associates. The full email is[ available on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/steptoe-match-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Biglaw Celebrates Solid Revenue Before The Bottom Falls Out
## Growth outpaced expenses... but trouble may be on the horizon.

The nine-month numbers are in, and law firms are still making money.

To be a little more specific, the Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group collected data from 190 firms and [found that revenue continues to creep up](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/11/12/law-firm-revenues-rise-as-demand-accelerates-citi-reports/), prompting victory laps around the law firm world. That expenses grew almost as much is a trifle.

At least expenses didn’t swamp revenue growth, so that’s good! Revenue growth clocked in at 5.1 percent over the first nine months while expenses grew by 4.7 percent. Conveniently, 4.7 percent was also the portion of revenue growth driven by billing rate growth so we’re pretty much just making clients pay more and calling it growth. That sounds sustainable!

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Looking at the results by revenue size, Am Law 51-100 firms continued to outperform other segments in revenue and demand growth, up 5.8% and 1.8%, respectively. While the collection cycle lengthened for these firms, Am Law 51-100 firms also had the highest inventory growth (at 7.5%), setting them up well for a strong end to the year. Am Law 1-50 firms may have trailed Am Law 51-100 firms in demand growth, but in another positive trend this year, we have seen demand performance for these firms continue to improve throughout the year, up 0.8% for the first nine months—much better than the 0.7% decline we saw during the first quarter. Am Law 1-50 rate increases continued to outpace other segments, up 5.2%, helping to drive the 5.4% growth in revenue (second only to the Am Law 51-100 firms), and in spite of the 1.6% lengthening of the collection cycle. With strong inventory levels (up 7.1%) for Am Law 1-50 firms, the outlook for the rest of the year is very positive.

That’s actually an interesting development since the growing gap between the Am Law 1-50 and 51-100 has defined the last several years. These numbers suggest that the second 50 have gained some traction.

Of course, this all depends on the bottom not falling out of an economy that looks increasingly like it’s been juiced up. General counsel are [already predicting the recession and planning to cut back on costs](https://www.law.com/2019/11/12/majority-of-general-counsel-believe-a-recession-is-coming-in-the-next-2-years/) — not great when demand is already stuck in molasses. Firms have quietly been stockpiling bankruptcy talent throughout the year because they know what’s coming.

Another lesson of the first nine months is that bigger remains better, with global firms performing better than the rest of the legal landscape:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
National firms saw solid revenue growth (5.6%), driven by a combination of 1.4% demand growth and 3.8% rate increases. Inventory growth of 5.9% signals a strong year-end.

Regional firms were the only segment to continue to see a demand decline, though it moderated from the 1.3% decline reported for the first half, to 0.5% decline for the nine-month period. Revenue growth of 3.5% trailed all segments, far below the 4.2% growth in expenses. Looking ahead, 6.2% growth in inventory means that there is opportunity for these firms to see a decent end to the year.

While the report concludes by trying to put a happy face on all this, it’s getting harder and harder to feel good about revenue growth driven almost entirely by just asking clients to pay more. That’s a business model that doesn’t bode well when clients have to start tightening their belts.

Next year could get ugly.

# The Agony Of Wasted Time
## As attorneys, unless we use alternative fee structures, our time is our trade. But this is a game-changer.

Time is the most precious commodity on earth. However, it is something we frequently throw away. For working parents who practice law, throwing away time feels particularly acute, even though “hours spent” is the metric that most of us use to earn a living. A few years ago, I found myself juggling the needs of my young child with the demands of my practice, both of which required my immediate attention and time. During this difficult moment, the vision for Trustate, a platform that helps trusts and estates professionals more effectively represent their clients, came to me.

As a working mother and experienced estate lawyer, I am passionate about using my skills to help families navigate the often-complex process of estate administration and planning. One day, my paralegal unexpectedly fell ill, and I was tasked with taking over their responsibilities on an estate administration matter, which included transferring a retirement account at a large bank. Despite my years of experience, the process proved to be incredibly frustrating and time-consuming, as I found myself navigating a maze of different departments and personnel, each with different sets of rules and procedures.

As I sat on the phone for what felt like an eternity, I received a call from daycare, informing me that my 6-month-old son had a fever and flu symptoms. I was faced with a difficult decision: stay on the phone and try to resolve the matter, or hang up and lose the prior 3.5 hours of work to go take care of my child? In the end, I chose to prioritize my child’s health (it turns out he had the flu). This experience left me feeling deeply frustrated and disillusioned with (1) the fact that it was a decision I had to think twice about, and (2) the way the legal industry handled estate administration.

I love the practice of law, particularly trusts and estates work. However, I have always been deeply uncomfortable with the fact that as attorneys, unless we use alternative fee structures, our time is our trade. To me, time is THE most valuable and fleeting asset, and there is no hourly rate high enough to justify the time that you can never get back. This discomfort is particularly apparent for lawyer-moms. We need to be there for those important moments when our families need us, and no nanny, au pair, relative, or daycare center will suffice.

As I waited for my son’s Tamiflu prescription at the pharmacy, I received an email with my annual employee review. My scores were down. The one aspect that stuck out to me the most was a significant decrease in my score in the “career commitment” category. To me, whether true or not, it seemed as though the time tradeoff of caring for my infant came at the expense of my standing within the firm.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Working women are expected to shrug off bias daily to the point where we don’t even realize it is happening half of the time. It is everything from being mistaken for a legal assistant on the phone, to having your older male client be mistaken for the lawyer when you are representing them in court, to having clients not disclose a material fact about their case or situation because they don’t want to “offend the lady,” to being referred to as the “girl” by a client. So what do we do? The brave ones own it. The others, the ones like me, shape the way we hold ourselves out professionally into something inauthentic in order to survive. We learn to remove our heart from our sleeve and tough it out by staying late at night when we have family obligations, feeling awful the entire way home for being the first to drop off and the last to pick up. Oddly enough, after coming back from maternity leave, I had never felt more committed to my career, yet my law firm did not view my commitment the same way. The yearning to provide a better life for my family was never more pressing, as well as the desire to show my children how their mom could be present in their lives and also be an accomplished professional.

As I cared for my sick 6-month-old, the idea of Trustate was born. The hard truth was that the lack of time-efficient processes to get work done was seemingly incompatible with my ability to advance professionally. However, I knew I wasn’t alone — thousands of other lawyers and support staff were dealing with the same problem. I realized there had to be a better way for lawyers and their staff to assist executors and grieving families with the tedious and overwhelming tasks that come with estate administration.

With Trustate, I’m proud to say that we have created a better way. Our amazing team designed and created an innovative platform that streamlines the process of estate administration, trust administration, and estate planning, making it easier for busy lawyers, such as working mothers, to provide effective counsel to their clients. For many, they can now achieve independence as they start to grow and scale their own practices and handle more sophisticated client matters. Our platform is designed to help firms realize more revenue by minimizing unbillable time and increasing staff bandwidth. We also offer a range of services that the law firm can use to complete the work correctly, and with far less written-off time, including data discovery, account transfers, and other administrative tasks. Additionally, by providing a range of legal support services, Trustate helps lawyers minimize the risk of errors and oversights, which can lead to malpractice claims.

In short, Trustate was born out of my own experience as a working mother and my desire to make the estate administration process as easy and stress-free as possible. I believe that our platform is a game-changer for the legal industry, and I am proud to be part of a company that is making a real difference in the lives of our clients.

# Everyone's A Winner With These Salary Raises

Check out the important update at the end of this post.

Just like their [old theme song](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/08/nixon-peabody-this-is-not-a-love-theme-song/) said, everyone’s a winner at Nixon Peabody, so I guess we shouldn’t be surprised that when they decided to raise salaries, the firm did it across all of their U.S. offices.

Before we get into the details of the raise, let’s take a moment to relive Nixon Peabody’s PR nightmare from way back when.

That really is a catchy little tune.

Anyway, back to the money. Here are the pertinent details from a tipster:

What we heard is that the numbers are still in flux but the first year match will be 180 and then raises will follow accordingly for other years – not clear if it will be a full match but sounds like probably no. Hopefully it is though! Yes, all effective July 1.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So it is definitely good news for first years, and everyone else will have to wait and see. But some raise news is better than no raise news! We’ll update this story as more information becomes available.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

UPDATE 6/17/16 3:31PM: Since posting this story, the details of which were confirmed by two Above the Law tipsters, we are hearing some conflicting information. Now some sources are reporting that they haven’t heard anything regarding raises from the firm (the initial tips indicated the info was relayed during a meeting, so perhaps these folks weren’t in attendance?), while others are reporting a denial about raising salaries. So what is going on at Nixon Peabody? With profits per partner that [rose a stellar 19.1 percent last year](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202752945641/The-Am-Law-100-Gross-Revenue-Profits-Surge-at-Nixon-Peabody), one would think the firm was ripe for a salary raise. As always, please send us any tips you may have (text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath)) on this developing situation.

It will certainly take some time to get used to ‘KC’. I imagine there will be a few slip ups over the next few months as lawyers, judges and clients adjust to the new title.

— King’s Counsel [Jeffrey Sullivan](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/sullivan-jeffrey-m/), a London-based partner at Gibson Dunn, commenting in an interview with [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/queens-counsel-no-more-kings-counsel-return-uk-courts-after-70-years-2022-09-14/) on the change in title for elite litigators who used to be known as “Queen’s Counsel” or “QC” prior to Queen Elizabeth’s death last week. “KC has a sort of ancient ring to it,” [Paul Mitchard](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/m/mitchard-paul), a King’s Counsel and retired partner at Skadden Arps, told Reuters. “The change of our names will be a constant reminder that the Queen has gone,” said KC [Lord Peter Goldsmith](https://www.debevoise.com/lordgoldsmithqc), a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton who served as the UK’s attorney general from 2001 to 2007.

# USCIS Explains Solution To 60-Day Grace Period For Laid-Off Immigrant Workers
## USCIS’ detailed and thorough FAQ explains how laid-off immigrants can protect their status.

As I write this in March 2023, the tech layoffs have continued in earnest. While the exact number of immigrant workers that have been laid off remains unknown, the number is significant. In my opinion, it can be called a crisis. Thousands of people face serious challenges and the possibility of being forced to leave the United States.

The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)[ released](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/information-for-employers-and-employees/options-for-nonimmigrant-workers-following-termination-of-employment) an [informational document](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/information-for-employers-and-employees/options-for-nonimmigrant-workers-following-termination-of-employment) (updated in March) that clarifies a few of its policies that bring some relief in the situation. While these aren’t changes in law, the policy clarifications could make it easier for a laid-off worker to find a new job and keep their immigration status in the United States.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
When an immigrant worker on an H-1B, L-1, O-1 or any other work visa loses their job, the clock starts ticking on a 60-day grace period. During that time, they have permission to remain in the U.S., and they are not removable. But the person must take action within those 60 days if they want to stay in the U.S. after the grace period. Those actions will bring challenges along the way, as I wrote [in my December 2022 column](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/the-biden-administration-should-extend-the-60-day-grace-period-for-laid-off-skilled-immigrant-workers/).

Over the past several months, many people, including me, have advocated for USCIS to increase the 60-day grace period during this time of economic turmoil. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren of California’s 18th District and Congresswoman Anna Eshoo of California’s 16th District — who both represent parts of Silicon Valley — also wrote to the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security asking to increase the grace period.

However, the reality is that regulatory changes can take months to accomplish.  The time it would take to change the law on the grace period would take too long to help the immigrant workers who are already in the middle of this situation.

Fortunately, USCIS’ detailed and thorough [FAQ](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/information-for-employers-and-employees/options-for-nonimmigrant-workers-following-termination-of-employment) explains how laid-off immigrants can protect their status. USCIS also makes several very welcome policy explanations that will help with some specific challenges.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The guidance brings relief on several issues. Here are just two issues that have been causing much anxiety to people.

First, there was increasing confusion and anxiety about when the 60-day grace period begins. Many companies are giving 60 days’ notice and paying employees as “active” employees while the notice period expires. Confusion arose about whether the 60-day countdown begins when they are notified and stop working, or if it is the last day the payroll was issued.

USCIS has confirmed on the FAQ that the last pay stub will determine the first day of the grace period. “The maximum 60-day grace period starts the day after termination of employment, which is typically determined based on the last day for which a salary or wage is paid,” the policy document states.

The second policy clarification I would like to highlight is a common scenario, where a person gets a new job while a change of immigration status application is still pending. The potential conflict is this: When someone files multiple immigration applications, generally the first application needs to be approved for the subsequent one to be approved. However, some forms can be expedited through  premium processing, but others cannot. In this situation, changing the status to a tourist visa (B-1/B-2) with Form I-539 is a necessity to avoid deportation. However, Form I-539 can take over a year to adjudicate and is not eligible for premium processing. Yet, the Form I-129, which employers use for filing work visa applications, is eligible for premium processing. To ensure one could work quickly upon filing the I-129, an applicant may pay the premium processing fee, but the authorization to work would not be given before the approval of the prior I-539 application.

USCIS clarified its policies on this important issue, stating that there should be no delay in work authorization even if there are the two applications filed on behalf of the worker, as the USCIS FAQ states:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
If an employer files a Form I-129 petition on your behalf, along with a request for premium processing service, USCIS will generally process the pending I-539 and the I-129 together during the premium processing timeframe and issue concurrent decisions. This means there should be no delay in adjudication of the I-129 because of the pending I-539. No formal request is required from the for the pending I-539 to be prioritized. If USCIS approves the I-129 petition, including any requested change of status, then you generally will obtain the nonimmigrant status requested on the I-129 petition (not the I-539), and may begin working. You generally would not need to depart the United States to obtain the requested nonimmigrant status in this scenario.

This means that both of those forms will be adjudicated together without any further action from the applicant, lawyer, or employer. Without this solution, the applicant would have had to leave the United States, potentially facing a myriad of challenges before re-entering.

While a longer grace period would still be useful, with the new comprehensive guidelines that cover many other equally important concerns, I do feel relieved for my clients and community. I commend USCIS for streamlining and clarifying these policies.

It’s important to acknowledge the hard work of all the advocates, particularly the American Immigration Lawyers Association ([AILA](https://www.aila.org/)), reporters, and media that stepped up their advocacy and shared stories. While the bigger economic problems and layoffs may continue in 2023, I thank USCIS for taking swift action for laid-off immigrant workers.

# Am Law 200 Firm Puts Its Employees On Ice With Furloughs, Salary Cuts

The concerning financial consequences of the coronavirus pandemic have resulted in layoffs, furloughs, and salary adjustments across all avenues of employment, but when it comes to the legal sector, the cuts have been deep. Dozens of firms have tightened their belts to prepare for the loss of cash this will cause them, and legal professionals ranging from staff members to equity partners have been squeezed.

[We’ve been tracking](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-covid-crisis-law-firm-layoff-tracker-whats-your-firm-doing-to-survive/) exactly how this is playing out, and now we’ve got news on some adverse employment action from a place that sounds more like a beer than a law firm. Crack open a cold one, because here come some more furloughs and salary cuts.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Sources tell us that Ice Miller, an Am Law 200 firm, has conducted furloughs among the members of its staff, but that attorney furloughs haven’t been contemplated. The firm will also be cutting salaries across the board, and everyone was notified of these adjustments via conference call from Steve Humke, the firm’s chief managing partner. Here’s a statement on the firm’s cost-cutting measures from Humke:

This morning, I announced that Ice Miller would be enacting several measures to help ensure that the Firm’s position remains strong through the economic crisis caused by COVID-19. First, we have made the difficult decision to furlough 35 professional staff and timekeepers. Eighteen of our furloughed team members are professional staff. The rest are timekeepers. None are partners.

Second, we are temporarily adjusting compensation for all team members who make more than $50,000 per year. The amount of compensation reduction corresponds to team members’ compensation levels. No individual’s compensation will fall below $50,000 per year, and our partners will take the greatest reductions. Our intention is to raise all team members back to their regular compensation levels as soon as market forces allow. We believe that these measures are very much in line with others in our industry. Unlike many firms, Ice Miller has historically operated without reliance on a line of credit and does not hold back a significant portion of partner compensation for future distribution. Our partners share in the Firm’s profits each month after expenses are paid. This practice has given us a strong balance sheet entering into this crisis and positioned us well to continue to provide employment to our team members and excellent service to our clients. Since our partners don’t receive a smaller draw and a larger year-end payout, we think our partner compensation adjustment is in line with other firms who are on a draw system that have announced temporary reductions in partner compensation.

We believe that the compensation adjustments are necessary in order to protect the operating capital of the law firm and preserve jobs, while remaining a strong business partner for our clients. We understand that many of our clients have been hit especially hard by this crisis and are taking their own steps to protect their financial positions. Our commitment to our valued clients is as strong in difficult times as it is in times of plenty.

“I’m proud of our whole Ice Miller team,” Humke said, “who are sharing in the sacrifices necessary to support our clients through this unprecedented crisis.” We hope those affected at the firm are able to get the support they need.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

The sun will rise. Tax season is upon us. Cravath recently sent out their round of salary bumps. We wake, H&R Block becomes relevant again, and competing firms match, in that order.

It is the way of the world and the most recent firm to stay on top of their game is Weil, Gotshal & Manges.

Here is the scale:

Class Year	Base Salary Retroactive to January 1, 2022
2021	$215,000
2020	$225,000
2019	$250,000
2018	$295,000
2017	$345,000
2016	$370,000
2015	$400,000
2014	$415,000
The payments will be retroactive to January 1st and will be reflected in March 31st paychecks.

(Turn to the next page to see the Weil, Gotshal & Manges memo.)

We like hearing about salary increases almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Enters The Bonus Fray
## It’s a match at Mayer Brown!

It was just the other day that Above the Law lamented the relative slowness of Biglaw bonus announcements. But bitch, and you shall receive.

Top 20 Biglaw firm — by revenue — Mayer Brown has announced their year-end largesse. Unsurprisingly, the firm will match the new bonus scale announced last week by Cravath. That’s a nice (~15 percent) increase for most associates.

Here’s the new scale you’ve probably already memorized:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


The full memo is available on the next page.

UPDATE: The above chart is only applicable to the New York office. For the Charlotte, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Palo Alto, San Francisco, and Washington D.C. offices, the below chart is in effect ([full memo available here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/mayer-brown-bonus/3/)). The tiered schedule leaves the class of 2021 off the chart, and provides high-biller bumps for non-NY associates. And New York-based tipsters — at least those on track to bill a lot — seem pretty miffed about the slight. Said one, “As someone who is currently at 2200+ hours, I’m pretty annoyed by this.”

Yikes. How do other Mayer Brown associates feel about this development? Will the firm step up for high billers in the NY office? Feel free to sound off by text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches). A funny or insightful comment could make its way into an update of this story.

# Top International Biglaw Firm Increases Office Attendance Mandate
## Lawyers are reportedly unhappy about the changes being made.

One by one, Biglaw firms are revising their pandemic-era remote work policies to reflect the changing times — and it seems that lawyers are still quite upset about having to spend more time at the office.

Gowling WLG — a top international firm that brought in $656,653,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 89 on the 2023 Global 200 — recently informed its attorneys that come May, they’d have to spend 60% of their time working from the office. This is a 10% increase from the firm’s current 50/50 split under its Agile+ hybrid work policy. According to [RollOnFriday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/gowling-wlg-slashes-wfh), people aren’t happy about the change.

It now appears that Agile+ is becoming more Agile-, as lawyers have got in touch with RollOnFriday voicing their disapproval of having to spend more time in the office. One lawyer said many of their colleagues were “not happy…especially as there was no consultation or survey about it this time,” adding, “we don’t feel like our opinions are valued as the firm did not engage with us.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[Andy Stylianou](https://gowlingwlg.com/en/people/andy-stylianou/#panel-button1), the firm’s chair, offered a statement on the updated policy, saying, “We know from our experience over the last year or so that more regular time in the office supports collaboration, helps our people build their skills and experience by working side-by-side with colleagues and ensures that our culture continues to thrive.” He further noted that the increase in time spent at the office is “a small but important change that will benefit both the business and our people as they build their skills and careers.”

Per a firm spokesperson, only lawyers and related legal teams will have to abide by the increase in time spent working from the office. All other teams will remain on the 50/50 hybrid schedule.

Stylianou added that the firm’s policies may be subject to additional change, saying, “We always keep our agile approach under review to ensure we are delivering the very best for our clients and fostering a strong team culture, alongside flexibility for our people.”

How is your firm mandating (or not) in-office attendance? As soon as you find out about office attendance plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Biglaw Firm Will Vote To Oust Partner Suing Them For Gender Discrimination
## This is the juiciest Biglaw lawsuit in a while.

Kerrie Campbell

Chadbourne & Parke — [soon to be known as Norton Rose Fulbright](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/biglaw-merger-means-the-end-of-chadbourne-parke/) — isn’t too pleased with partner Kerrie Campbell. And that isn’t much of a surprise; after all, she is ([along with](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-pay-discrimination-case-adds-a-new-plaintiff/) two other [named plaintiffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/3rd-former-partner-files-suit-against-chadbourne-over-unequal-pay/)) [suing them for $100 million](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/) in a purported class action alleging gender discrimination and unequal pay. But of course — because this case has been [juicy AF](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/chadbourne-class-action-lawsuit-gets-juicy-af-lawyer-fires-back-against-criticism/) — the firm has publicly announced that they don’t want anything to do with Campbell, revealing that they’ve been trying to get rid of her for awhile.

The statement is on the long side,  but well worth the time:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
A meeting of the partnership of Chadbourne & Parke LLP will be scheduled to consider and vote upon a motion to expel Kerrie Campbell from the partnership. Early last year, Chadbourne’s Management Committee asked Ms. Campbell to voluntarily leave the Firm when it became impossible to ignore, even after a very short time with the Firm, her failure to deliver in the way she represented when she joined Chadbourne, her exhibiting questionable legal judgment, her serious and disruptive failures in practice management, and her displaying poor personal judgment, among other things. This was done quietly and carefully in order to give her the chance to achieve better results with a fresh start elsewhere. She decided not to do so and, instead, chose to pursue baseless claims in the cynical pursuit of a big and underserved payday. The Firm has been exceedingly patient and sought to avoid having a formal expulsion vote if other outcomes were possible. As Chadbourne prepares for a new future, the choices Ms. Campbell has made have left the Firm no alternative but to seek to bring this relationship to an end in this manner. No matter how she will try to mischaracterize it, this decision is the inevitable result of the choices Ms. Campbell has made.

So, perhaps unsurprisingly, they’re posturing that the entire case was an attempt by Campbell to cover up her subpar work. That doesn’t explain the other plaintiffs, but it appears to be central to the firm’s defense of Campbell’s claims.

Because the parties in this case seem to recognize the court of public opinion is still very much in play, Campbell’s lawyer, [David Sanford](https://sanfordheisler.com/team/david-sanford/), had his own response. As the [American Lawyer reports](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202783067293/Chadbourne-Wants-Kerrie-Campbell-to-Leave-the-Building):

“By calling the planned expulsion vote ‘the inevitable result of the choices Ms. Campbell has made’ in bringing suit against the firm, Chadbourne openly admits that the vote to terminate Ms. Campbell is retaliatory,” Sanford said. “Unfortunately for Norton Rose Fulbright, this discriminatory and overtly retaliatory act is a liability that will not disappear with the firm’s upcoming merger. We will pursue discovery to determine Norton Rose Fulbright’s role in directing or approving Ms. Campbell’s expulsion.”

Those are fightin’ words. Which, since this is an active litigation, makes sense.

# And Now BOTH Biglaw Lawyers Have Resigned Over The Trump Call
## There's an unfortunate theme to this whole week.

The week began with an [explosive audio recording](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-transcript-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/2768e0cc-4ddd-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html) of Donald Trump pressuring Georgia election officials to accept debunked conspiracy theories and “find” enough ballots to allow him to win the state. While most of the country marveled that Trump was caught on tape seemingly committing the requisite acts of attempted election interference — query whether he’s capable of mens rea at this point — the legal world marveled that three lawyers sat in on a call like that.

And then the Capitol was ransacked by a violent mob and election fraud seemed somewhat quaint by comparison.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
One of the lawyers, Cleta Mitchell, was a [partner at Foley & Lardner as the week began](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/donald-trump-drags-biglaw-firm-into-middle-of-election-interference-effort/). As the firm scrambled to respond as clients protested the firm’s involvement in the dubious election effort and groups began to agitate for clients to boycott en masse, the firm indicated that Mitchell had gone rogue and began offering professional succor to the president’s quixotic QAnon quackery. A day later, [Foley & Lardner announced that Mitchell was out](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/cleta-mitchell-out-at-foley-lardner-after-troubling-donald-trump-call/) — resigning in a letter that blamed “leftists” and not the problematic business and ethical morass she’d tried to drag her firm into.

Alex Kaufman of Fox Rothschild didn’t speak on the call — and says he does not and has not represented Trump — though was introduced as one of “the attorneys that represent the president.” He remained unidentified for a few days before [we revealed his involvement yesterday morning](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/there-was-another-biglaw-firm-partner-on-the-donald-trump-call-with-georgia-election-officials/). The firm informed us last night that Kaufman and his father, Emory Law Alumni Board member Robert Kaufman, had agreed to leave (Kaufman’s statement is included in our prior article).

And while Mitchell blames “leftists” for pressuring Foley & Lardner, this bellyaching is just a sad reflection of the culture of irresponsibility that’s grown up around the conservative movement. In both cases, the respective firms refused to get involved in election challenges as a matter of policy… and the lawyers went ahead anyway. The firms made their decisions based on an assessment of both professional and business concerns. To be dragged into asserting claims that had already been rejected by courts across the country  (and are triggering sanction motions against other lawyers) hurts the reputation and business of every other partner in the firm. But these two, whether they thought about it in these terms or not, put themselves ahead of all that.

Just like the anti-mask brigade puts their convenience ahead of public health. And how the rioters put their delusions ahead of the safety and the sanctity of the American government. And, now, how [Lindsey Graham is trying to blame Portland for the mob he spent four years whipping up](https://therecount.com/wire/sen-lindsey-graham-rsc-blames/2645865440). Nothing is ever these people’s responsibility. They can do whatever they want and if not, it’s the fault of leftists, or Dominion, or Hugo Chavez, or China, or Fauci, or the Woke Crowd, or AOC, or Pelosi, or Portlandia reruns.

# Morning Docket: 05.16.16
## * As the Obama administration pushes for recognition of transgender rights, the transgender community may have found an unlikely ally: the late Justice Antonin Scalia. His opinion in the 1998 Oncale decision on sex discrimination was cited in the administration's letter to public school officials warning them that gender-identity discrimination was prohibited by civil rights laws. A former Scalia clerk has called it an “absurd misreading of Title IX.” [[Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-transgender-legal-analysis-20160513-snap-story.html)] * We're now in the home stretch of the Supreme Court's term, and with upcoming rulings on affirmative action, abortion, contraceptive coverage, immigration, and Puerto Rico's debt, it's going to get harder and harder for the justices to avoid 4-4 splits. In the majority of these cases, they'll have to stop agreeing to disagree so it doesn't look like we've got a Court in controversy with many deadlocks. [[Bloomberg Politics](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-13/decision-time-arrives-for-controversy-shy-u-s-supreme-court)] * The State Bar of California has been criticized over a lack of transparency as to its finances, and in particular, its ""rampant spending"" on executive salaries. In fact, those at the top of the food chain at the California Bar earn salaries which exceed that of the state's governor, who earns nearly $180,000 per year. That's a lot of cash to fail more than half of the state's bar-exam takers (more on that later today)! [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/05/13/california-state-bar-criticized-for-lack-of-transparency-inflated-salaries/?ref=/blogs/law)] * ""She has single-handedly stuck a knife in the back of every Uber driver in the country. The entire class was thrown under the bus and backed over."" Shannon Liss-Riordan, the lawyer who arranged a $100 million settlement deal in the Uber class-action over drivers' employment status, is being attacked by her own clients, and now other lawyers are trying to have her removed as lead attorney on the case.

That's not a work perk companies are willing to brag about. More and more technology startups are embracing arbitration agreements to prevent their employees from filing lawsuits over workplace disputes that could have potentially ruinous financial effects on their bottom lines if they were litigated in court.

Which law firms are out there winning the legal marketing game on social media and which firms are still rocking their MySpace page? Maybe that’s not fair… after all, MySpace might be where we all end up once Elon’s finished with Twitter and Zuckerberg finishes collapsing Facebook into a collection of creepy VR avatars. So let’s replace that with “which firms are still hosting their firm website on GeoCities?”

Answering that question is the charge of the [Social Law Firm Index 2022](https://legalmarketing.good2bsocial.com/slfi-2022), the annual report on digital marketing from [Good2bSocial](https://good2bsocial.com/). The index measures the “reach, engagement and marketing performance on platforms including LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and podcasts.” These measurements are then plugged into the Good2bSocial algorithm to develop each firm’s rank.

BR’s Instagram followers skyrocketed after they represented actor Johnny Depp in his defamation suit. Clark said their 17,000-plus followers are incredibly passionate about their content and engagement on this platform is off the charts. Sharing videos of attorneys helps drive feedback.

There’s a lot in here to check out… and the report should properly shame some firms really struggling on the internet.

So who ranks top 5 overall?

“We see our social media channels as an essential part of our firm’s brand, in which we showcase our legal experience, share our culture and reinforce our principles,” said Emily Rogers, Norton Rose Fulbright’s U.S. Chief Marketing and Business Development Officer. “We make sure everyone at our firm knows how to use the different channels and understands how the audiences differentiate.”

Congratulations on winning the internet this year!

The UK’s Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) is prosecuting Biglaw firm Dentons for its procedure — or lack thereof — in onboarding a client. The client — identified in SRA documents as Client A — was a bank chairman who was eventually jailed for laundering billions of dollars as part of an embezzlement scheme. According to the SRA, Dentons’ diligence in taking on Client A was lacking.

Client A’s relationship manager was partner [Francois Chateau.](https://www.dentons.com/en/francois-chateau) Chateau and his client list came to the Biglaw firm when Dentons combined with the smaller French law firm Salans.

As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/dentons-partner-called-colleague-big-prick-requesting-client-compliance-checks) Roll on Friday, the Tribunal heard that Chateau lashed out at a firm employee in compliance who dared to question Client A’s financials:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When a member of Dentons’ risk and compliance team flagged concerns over Client A’s plans to buy a bank in the UK, Chateau slammed him in a memo as “untrustworthy” and a “big prick showing a poor judgement and not knowing what he is doing”.

And when SRA investigators quizzed Chateau in 2020, he explained to them that it was “not in European culture” to delve into a client’s finances and “impolite” to ask them about their salaries.

Given the legal problems that would come to plague Client A, that memo did not age well.

The regulatory body has said the firm’s method of due diligence was problematic:

The SRA said Chateau’s approach to due diligence was the “exact opposite” of what was required and that he “appears to have taken a strikingly hostile approach to anyone asking to carry out the most elementary compliance checks”.

The regulator also described Chateau as “someone lacking in subtlety [and] insight” who did not have “respect” for the views of others.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Dentons is defending their process as in compliance with the appropriate regulatory standards of the time:

“The SRA appears to have felt driven to argue that the guidance issued by the Law Society, and approved by the Treasury, is irrelevant to the question of whether the Firm complied with the obligation to take adequate measures to establish Client A’s source of wealth and funds”, Dentons stated in its pleadings.

“This is an unattractive position for the regulator to adopt as a body required to prosecute responsibly, fairly and in the public interest”, the firm said.

The fact still remains that, internally, the alarm well was rung on Client A but ignored. But I guess “big prick” is apparently pronounced “completely right” in French.

As the Russian invasion of Ukraine enters its third week, the devastation and humanitarian crisis seems overwhelming. But there are resources, both financial and legal, in Biglaw. The question is: how are they using it?

Yesterday, the leadership at Debevoise announced they’d be matching donations, up to $1,500 per person, for any employee who gives to certain humanitarian aid organizations:

In Michael Blair’s email yesterday about responding to the situation in Ukraine, he mentioned that the Firm will provide a matching program for donations to certain humanitarian aid organizations that are providing assistance to Ukrainian civilians.  The three organizations for whom donations will be matched are UNICEF, the International Council of the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors without Borders.  Details, including Web links to their respective sites, are listed below.  The Firm will match up to $1,500 in total donations to these organizations per individual Firm employee.

Subject: Humanitarian Assistance to UkraineIn Michael Blair’s email yesterday about responding to the situation in Ukraine, he mentioned that the Firm will provide a matching program for donations to certain humanitarian aid organizations that are providing assistance to Ukrainian civilians.  The three organizations for whom donations will be matched are UNICEF, the International Council of the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors without Borders.  Details, including Web links to their respective sites, are listed below.  The Firm will match up to $1,500 in total donations to these organizations per individual Firm employee.While there are many organizations providing humanitarian relief to Ukraine, we have chosen these three for the quality of their work and resources they can provide, and for the ability of members of the Debevoise community across the various locations in which we operate, to contribute.  In most if not all jurisdictions, donations should also be tax deductible, though you should please confirm that for your location independently.
 

To make a donation that qualifies for the Firm’s matching program, you should make your donations directly on the website of the relevant organization(s) listed below.  Once you have donated, you should go to a link on DebWeb that we will be establishing shortly, to indicate which organizations you have contributed to and the amount of the donation.   As a reminder, for every $1 you donate to an eligible organization, the firm will donate $1 to the same organization, up to a total of $1,500 in donations per Firm employee.  We will send out a separate email with the link in the next 2-3 days.

 

Thank you in advance to those who would like to contribute in this way.

Arthur

This is kind of awkward for a lawyer to write, but it needs to be said, so here goes….

Even if your dance card is not filled, it is in your interest to rid yourself of certain clients that will harm your career and/or you cannot service appropriately. Non-optimal client relationships include the following, and you certainly know it when you see it:

- They want you personally to do everything.

- They don’t seem to care at all about you or your personal life or your other client/customer demands.
- They are enormously focused on price — no matter what service you provide or pricing adjustments you give them, they always want the price lower.
- They don’t make referrals or tout you or give strong references or show a desire to be helpful to you.
- They make you unhappy — possibly you are always worried you will lose their business.

- They monopolize your time so you can’t build relationships with good clients.
- You cannot service them properly because you don’t have the expertise or the staff but you are clinging to them even though it is not actually in the client’s interest.
Take a deep breath and end these relationships. You will feel great afterwards and, more importantly, a yoke will be off your neck that will permit you to do other things that will be advantageous for your career and at the same time better for the client as well. Instead of servicing a client that will not lead to anything good for you or the client, you will now have the chance to find clients that will be great win/win relationships.

Along these lines, reject the view that you will keep the non-optimal client until you find the good client. The non-optimal client will take up too much of your time and hinder your efforts to get the new client. This is scary to do but necessary.

And of course, one way or another, life is too short to not enjoy at least a good amount of it.

By the way, I don’t advocate terminating a client or business relationship rudely. You are in the same industry, and you don’t want to make an enemy. But you have a career to build and this is ruining your chances.

Also, sometimes a “bad” client can be a “great” friend and great relationship for you in the industry you work in. Occasionally, I have just spoken to a client and said something like this:

“Look. I think it is obvious we are great friends but the lawyer/client relationship isn’t a good one for us. Let’s end that and stay the closest of friends and try to help each other in the real estate world.”

Each time I have done this there has been a very positive — almost relieved — reaction from the client. It seems that when I am feeling it isn’t ‘right,” typically the client feels the same, and our relationship changes in a positive way. And a couple of times this has led to a discussion as to what is wrong with the lawyer/client relationship and we have fixed it and continued on, much improved.

A related issue is to try to pick your clients wisely. They should be ones you are simpatico with, who find your value propositions useful and inspiring, who like you personally, who benefit from your Power Niche, who you just click with, and most importantly who you can provide value to. If you can do that then the odds are that the relationship will be a good one for both of you.

Indeed, you can fall in love with a client like this, and really help the client build his/her business and add dramatic value. Also, hopefully, this client will add great value to your career.

To sum up, a good lawyer/client relationship is two-way in nature and, if it grows right, it can become truly a labor of love for the lawyer. I can truthfully say that I love my clients dearly. Of course have our “moments” but these are people who mean a lot to me and it makes just about every day a good and fun time to service them and help them in their careers and in achieving their business goals.

# Vault, Home To Law Firm Prestige Rankings, Becomes 'Firsthand' Subsite, Which Says Job Seekers Don't Care About Prestige

Vault Law has been one of the most trusted resources for law students and lawyers for more than two decades, providing law firm rankings and profiles based on the insider perspectives that lateral candidates want and need. Year after year, Vault has surveyed thousands of associates to create the rankings that lawyers rely upon to find out what they need to know, ranging from which law firms are the most prestigious to which law firms are the best ones to work for.

But what would happen if Vault were to just disappear all of sudden?

To the untrained eye, that certainly looks like exactly what happened. The [Vault](https://vault.com/) website now redirects to the [Firsthand](https://firsthand.co/) website, where Vault Law lives as a sub-site (not to worry, it’s there complete with all of its [law firm rankings](https://firsthand.co/best-companies-to-work-for/law)).

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“Why has Vault destroyed its platform with whatever this ‘Firsthand’ is?” a reader asks. “We have relied on Vault for years and now it’s gone overnight?”

This past January, Infobase, the company that owns Vault, acquired Firsthand, a career mentoring and engagement platform for students and alumni. Over the course of 2021, the sites have been merging to create a new brand geared towards those who are seeking professional work in COVID times.

According to Firsthand — the name the companies settled on — these post-pandemic job seekers are living in a world where remote work is now the norm and “company culture, social impact, and quality of life outweigh the importance of traditional job criteria like money, prestige, and advancement opportunities.” (Shhh, don’t tell them — or maybe DO — but lawyers still really care about money and prestige.) Here’s an excerpt from their [message](https://firsthand.co/blogs/general-articles/introducing-the-new-firsthand-brand-and-platform) introducing the new brand:

The old Vault and Firsthand brands focused on the idea of vaulting ahead to a narrow definition of career success, like getting your foot in the door at a prestigious firm and working your way up to partner. With our new brand, we’re widening our perspective to recognize that the path to success is rarely straight and that there are many ways to define success.

Aww. That’s nice.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to compute with the reality that most young lawyers are facing, which is up to six figures of debt attached to a law degree that isn’t going to pay itself off. Everyone got a break from their loans since March 2020, but those bills will be coming due sooner than anyone would like, and a big, fat paycheck from a prestigious firm will help them manage their law school debts more easily than any other definition of success.

Are you worried about the Vault name and the prominence of its law firm rankings now that Vault is just a subsection of Firsthand? We’ve reached out to Vault for comment on that. Here’s what we were told:

While this is a time of change for us, the Vault Law editorial team will still be here, publishing the same rankings and resources that law students, laterals, and others in the legal industry have come to value and trust over the years. Meanwhile, we are excited about the new opportunities we can now offer legal job seekers, including one-on-one mentoring and virtual career fairs.

In legal technology, where innovation meets tradition, aligning business outcomes with technological solutions is not just beneficial — it’s essential. This strategic alignment ensures that every tech initiative is not only a leap forward in capabilities but also a step toward achieving the overarching goals of legal practice. It transforms technology from a mere tool into a catalyst for meaningful change, ensuring investments in legal tech go beyond innovation for its own sake to deliver real, tangible value.

Understanding Business Outcomes In Legal Practice

Business outcomes in the legal sector encompass a broad spectrum of objectives, including enhanced efficiency, improved client satisfaction, increased profitability, and greater access to justice. Aligning these outcomes with legal tech initiatives requires a deep understanding of both the legal services being offered and the needs and expectations of clients. It demands a shift from seeing technology as an end in itself to viewing it as a means to achieve specific, strategic goals.

The Process Of Alignment

Aligning business outcomes with legal tech initiatives involves several key steps, each critical to ensuring that technology serves the broader objectives of the legal practice:

- Define Clear, Measurable Objectives
The first step is to articulate what success looks like for the legal practice. This involves setting clear, measurable objectives that technology can help achieve. Whether it’s reducing the time spent on document review, enhancing client communication, or streamlining case management, having specific goals in mind guides the selection and implementation of technology.

- Engage Stakeholders In The Planning Process
Successful alignment requires the engagement of all stakeholders, including legal professionals, administrative staff, and clients. Understanding their needs, expectations, and pain points ensures that the chosen technology addresses real challenges and contributes to desired outcomes.

- Conduct A Gap Analysis
A gap analysis helps identify the discrepancies between current capabilities and desired outcomes. By understanding these gaps, legal practices can select technologies that specifically address areas of need, ensuring that each tech initiative moves the needle toward achieving business objectives.

- Prioritize User Adoption And Training
For technology to impact business outcomes, it must be adopted and used effectively by its intended users. This requires prioritizing user adoption through comprehensive training, support, and ongoing engagement to ensure that the technology is integrated into daily workflows and contributes to achieving business goals.

- Measure And Adjust
Lastly, aligning business outcomes with legal tech initiatives is an ongoing process. It requires regular performance measurement against objectives and the flexibility to adjust strategies as needed. This iterative process ensures that technology remains aligned with evolving business goals and continues to deliver value over time.

Overcoming Challenges

The alignment process is not without its challenges. Resistance to change, budget constraints, and rapid technological advancement can all pose obstacles to effective alignment. Overcoming these challenges requires a commitment to clear communication, stakeholder engagement, and a culture of continuous improvement.

Strategic Advantages

Aligning business outcomes with legal tech initiatives offers a strategic advantage. It ensures that technology investments are not just cost centers but strategic tools that contribute to the overall success and competitiveness of the legal practice. This alignment fosters a culture of innovation where technology is leveraged to enhance service delivery, improve client outcomes, and achieve operational excellence.

Looking Ahead

As the legal industry continues to navigate the waters of digital transformation, aligning business outcomes with legal tech initiatives remains a critical factor in determining the success of these efforts. By focusing on this alignment, legal practices can ensure that their investment in technology is not just a pursuit of the latest trends but a strategic choice that drives real business value, enhances the practice of law, and ultimately serves the interests of justice more effectively. In this way, technology becomes a tool for innovation and a cornerstone of strategic growth and success in the legal profession.

# Biglaw Sexual Harassment Lawsuit Alleges Partner Wanted To Be 'Sugar Daddy'
## Another Biglaw firm is on the defense against claims of sexual harassment.

Another day, another Biglaw gender discrimination lawsuit. The latest case was filed by a former secretary at Troutman Sanders, Jessica Correa, against the firm and former transactional partner Gerald Francese (Francese is now a [partner at Locke Lord](https://www.lockelord.com/professionals/f/francese-gerald)).

The complaint describes escalating behavior that Correa says left her feeling “uncomfortable, vulnerable, and sexualized.” Francese allegedly began by using pet names for Correa and ogling her. According to the complaint, the increasingly aggressive inappropriate behavior included trying to kiss Correa, offering to be her “Sugar Daddy,” and inviting her to dinner and vacations. As [reported by](https://biglawbusiness.com/troutman-sanders-secretary-accuses-partner-of-sexual-harassment) Big Law Business:

Francese, who had a reputation for being “very generous” with the staff, was soon calling her “cutie” and creating situations where he could stare at her breasts, Correa says. He also commented on and offered to adjust her clothing. Next came dinner invitations, which Francese really envisioned as dates, and physical touching, according to the complaint.

While at dinner one night, Francese mentioned Korean prostitutes and later tried to kiss her, the lawsuit says. He loaned her $2,600 when she had personal issues and then offered to be her “Sugar Daddy.” He ultimately kissed her twice against her will and retaliated when she worked up the courage to complain, Correa says.

Correa says when she complained about Francese’s behavior, he badmouthed her performance to HR, which led to her being “constructively discharged” from the firm.

Troutman Sanders and Francese have not yet commented on the lawsuit.

# Big Money For Associates At This Biglaw Firm
## What an exciting time to be an associate!

Biglaw firms seemed to have cracked the code on what it takes these days to be considered as a member of the elite, and as it turns out, the secret isn’t really that secret. A Cravath salary match is what it will take to propel your firm into the Biglaw stratosphere during this hot lateral market, and the latest firm to do so is Haynes & Boone.

Sources say the firm — which brought in $430,200,000 gross revenue in 2020, landing it at #93 in the most recent Am Law 100 — doesn’t usually send out mass emails to reflect compensation or bonus news, but it looks like a Cravath match has been made. “From what I can tell (talking to associates in multiple classes), it is a Cravath match at all levels,” said a tipster. “Everyone is thrilled that HB continues to match the market.”

That said, here’s what the salary scale now looks like at the firm:

Class of 2021: $215,000
Class of 2020: $225,000
Class of 2019: $250,000
Class of 2018: $295,000
Class of 2017: $345,000
Class of 2016: $370,000
Class of 2015: $400,000
Class of 2014: $415,000

Congratulations to everyone at Haynes & Boone!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Kirkland & Ellis Delights With Extra Special Bonuses For Some Of The Hardest Workers At The Firm
## Kudos to the firm!

[I’ve said it before](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/goodwin-staff-bonuses/), and I’ll say it again: more Biglaw firms should be giving special COVID appreciation bonuses to their staff. It’s been a hard year for everyone, and while we here at Above the Law have been vocal in [applauding the associate special bonuses ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/)that are sweeping the elite of Biglaw, it’s important to remember Biglaw is not made of lawyers alone. So kudos to the firms going out of their way to appreciate (with cash) their support staff.

The latest firm to dip into their pockets to say thank you to staff is Kirkland & Ellis, the firm that has a stranglehold on the top of the Am Law rankings. They’re offering a special bonus — yes, on top of the usual year-end bonuses — of 5 percent of salaries, plus an additional 1 percent to their retirement accounts. From the memo by John Ballis, K&E’s chair ([full memo available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/kirkland-staff-bonuses/2/)):

As a tangible expression of our appreciation, in addition to our regular merit-based salary increases and year-end bonuses, the share partnership will be providing our administrative staff members with a thank you gift equivalent to 5% of your 2020 base salary in a cash bonus, and an additional 1% of your annual base salary in your retirement account*. These funds will be paid in December, and details will be shared in the coming days from your local leadership.

# How To Write A Compelling Legal Resume That Lands Interviews
## It’s important keep your legal resume clean, concise, and succinct.

As the end of Q1 approaches, you might be feeling uneasy about the unsteady economic climate, including the layoffs in Biglaw and across the tech industry. With the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, you might also feel nervous about the unknown shifts in the startup world. It’s important to know hiring has been ongoing in the legal market throughout the entirety of Q1. Yes, legal hiring is still going strong.

If you’re considering exploring what’s out there, your first step is to update your legal resume. [Writing your legal resume](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/quick-ways-to-refresh-optimize-and-modernize-your-legal-resume/) is a daunting task, particularly since you’re looking inwardly from a subjective perspective, as opposed to the 30,000-foot view a reader is objectively seeing it from.

As someone who is trained and specializes in legal resume writing, I want to provide clear guidance and actionable steps you can take to help draw out your best-selling assets, major transactions, and differentiating value. If you’re applying for roles but hearing crickets, your legal resume might not contain enough insights and examples of your skill sets. It may also need some major reshaping from both a strategy and formatting perspective to help increase its readability and digestibility.

Pick Your Most Prominent Competency Areas To Discuss In Your Legal Resume 

First, in order for your legal resume to effectively market you and distinguish your unique value, distill your legal experience based on competency areas. Think about the major areas of focus or specialties you’ve concentrated on throughout your legal career and what you consider yourself an expert in — are you more focused on M&A transactions, contract negotiations, or litigation?

For example, if you’ve been primarily focused on litigation, what types of cases do you typically handle? Are there specific areas of concentration or repeat issues that your litigation experience touches on? What has been your largest case (valuation) to date versus your smallest? Are you taking these cases to trial or strategically negotiating them at mediation? What role do you play in litigation? Are you overseeing an internal or outside litigation team? What types of clients in what industries are you typically representing?

Are you a specialist in labor and employment, data privacy, or intellectual property? Or are you more of a corporate generalist with broad exposure to many different practice areas?

As you can see, it’s important to get granular because your legal resume has one purpose: getting your foot in the door for the job interview. While a resume is a snapshot of your career, you want to build enough context in order for a legal recruiter, hiring partner, or senior executive team member to easily understand the breadth of your experience and what you bring to the table at first glance.

Review Job Postings Before You Begin Writing Your Legal Resume

As I have mentioned previously within my columns, it’s [imperative that you know the target role you’re seeking](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/job-searching-here-are-some-linkedin-features-you-should-be-utilizing/) before you begin writing your legal resume. Your legal resume should be narrowly tailored and focused on the specific competencies of that role and how you’ve excelled at those competencies. Analyzing job postings is extremely helpful because you’ll notice patterns of skill sets for specific roles. You’ll be able to better identify which skills matter most, and draw a connection between your experience and the company’s needs. Be prepared to explain what outcomes and results you’ve effectuated for companies and what the future company can expect from you. Alignment is key.

It might be helpful to create a spreadsheet and match up target skills with examples from your background of key transactions and other accomplishments that you will use as factual support and evidence of those skills. This is also very good interview preparation for your upcoming job search.

Facts And Proof Matter In Your Legal Resume

There are specific hard and soft skills you’ll want to consider including in your legal resume. But also think beyond responsibilities and job functions. What points do you want to drive home to a reader about your experience? What facts and proof do you have to support that you’re the right fit for the role? Remember, without the proof, it’s just fluff and hyperbole.

If you’ve had a mix of law firm and in-house experience, state so from the very outset of your legal resume. If you’re applying to a public company and you worked for the SEC for a number of years in the earlier part of your legal career, that’s really lucrative experience that should be called out in your professional summary.

Your Legal Resume Should Be Easy And Simple To Digest

Lastly, your legal resume is not a chance to put a spin on a flair for the creative look. Legal resumes favor a simple, modern design sans the graphs, tables, and charts. Drop the Times New Roman font and opt for a font such as Calibri which is modern and easy on the eyes. If you’re causing a reader to shift eye movements too much between columns or using those templates sold on Etsy, your resume is an eyesore, not something easy to scan. When in doubt, consider what my research and writing professor always chanted: “[Simplicity, clarity, and brevity](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6914557047359311873?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6914557047359311873%29).”

At the end of the day, it’s important keep your legal resume clean, concise, and succinct.

# Sidley Enters The Associate Compensation Fray
## Extra good news for extraordinary associates.

When Cravath [announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/) a salary hike earlier this week, matching the [Milbank scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) for junior associates and coming over the top for the more experienced  attorneys, it was a signal to the rest of Biglaw to get their acts together. Since then, there has been a flood of other top firms announcing their own set of raises.

The most recent firm to get on board with associate raises is Sidley. And this isn’t a surprise, the firm is ranked number 6 in the country with $2,922,634,000 in gross revenue last year. *Not* responding to the wave of raises swirling through the top of Biglaw would be the bigger story.

The announcement went out earlier this morning, and the salary scale at the firm is as follows:

Class Year	2024 Salary
2015	445,000
2016	435,000
2017	420,000
2018	390,000
2019	365,000
2020	310,000
2021	260,000
2022	235,000
2023	225,000
This scale is in line with the Cravath scale announced earlier this week, with a small exception that is major for senior associates. The majority of firms that have announced raises so far have placed the class of 2015 off the compensation grid, meaning their salary is individualized. Sidley is the first firm to standardize ninth-year salaries.

Additionally, the firm announced their year-end bonuses:

Class Year	2023 Year-end Base Bonus
2015+	$115,000
2016	$115,000
2017	$105,000
2018	$90,000
2019	$75,000
2020	$57,500
2021	$30,000
2022	$20,000
Plus there’s extra good news for the super high billers and those with “exceptional performance” at the firm:

As in prior years, we also recognize associates who have higher productivity and/or exceptional performance with additional bonuses that exceed the base bonus amounts, resulting in those associates receiving more than the base bonus for their class year, and in some instances significantly more.

The full memo is available on the[ next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/sidley-compensation-23/2/).

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Associates Left Pondering The Meaning Of 'Good Standing' When Bonuses Disappoint
## This is why lockstep is best.

Those of you with libertarian leanings may scoff at the notion of lockstep bonuses. After all, how can the Biglaw firm really appreciate how you’re a special snowflake if you’re getting the same money as everyone else in your class? But for the rest of us, the transparency and predictability of lockstep bonuses is a good thing — a very good thing.

Take, for example, what’s going on in the New York and D.C. offices of Linklaters. The firm had announced a few weeks ago that they’d be paying associates in “good standing” individualized bonuses in line with the market standard. But when associates started getting their individualized bonus letters, what “good standing” actually meant was unclear to associates. As one tipster at the firm notes, the feeling is that bonuses were pretty arbitrary:

The good standing metrics seem like they are being enforced arbitrarily and there has been no transparency about how much each metric affects your bonus. Many high-billing associates got bonuses docked for not submitting their time under 1.8 days (even though the firm switched over to a new timekeeping software earlier this year that has been frequently buggy), while less busy associates got full bonuses even if they didn’t meet other metrics (like 100 pro bono hours).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
If there’s one thing I know from my years of working at Above the Law, when there’s a lack of transparency about something as important as money, discontent is sure to follow:

With the firm announcing a 25% increase in PPP, this feels like a slap in the face to those associates who were too busy billing to submit their time under the 1.8 day limit. I can tell you that morale in the office is not great.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and an evolving legal landscape, the art of managing outside counsel is undergoing a transformational shift.

Gone are the days when overseeing external legal partnerships was a straightforward task of cost analysis and performance monitoring. Legal operations leaders are now called upon to navigate a complex maze of strategic decision-making, technological integration, and relationship management. 

This article aims to shed light on the multifaceted role of outside counsel management, exploring lesser-known insights and emerging trends reshaping this critical aspect of legal operations.

From embracing generative AI to updating billing practices and fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation, we will delve into the strategies that are setting the stage for a new era in legal partnership management. 

Strategic Partnering Rather Than Mere Hiring

In modern legal operations, there is a paradigm shift from perceiving outside counsel as mere service providers to acknowledging them as strategic partners.

This perspective revolutionizes how legal departments engage with their external attorneys.

It’s not just about hiring legal expertise anymore; it’s about forging alliances that align with the broader objectives and values of the organization. A key element in nurturing these alliances is the implementation of formal outside counsel programs. These programs evaluate: 

- The utilization of law firms to ensure alignment with the expertise and resource needs of the legal department.
- The areas of duplication of firm utilization across practice groups to find opportunities to ensure they are appropriately obtaining the value of services for their spend across the department.
- Spend (e.g., legal fees, expenses, timekeeper utilization) associated with these outside counsel relationships to determine service delivery effectiveness of the firm across matters and practice groups. 
These evaluations position the legal department to strategically engage firms while promoting more profound, more meaningful relationships.

This is supported via a governance model inclusive of policies for law firm engagement, conflict waivers, etc., and outside counsel guidelines that establish the parameters of the relationship (e.g., matter management, communications, information security) inclusive of billing guidelines to create spend transparency and predictability.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Leveraging technology to manage outside counsel enables legal departments to manage the relationship substantively and financially.

Legal departments often implement eBilling tools to centralize and automate legal billing processes but implement them without strategic objectives in managing outside counsel relationships.

Outside counsel guideline billing rules, finance accruals expectations, timekeeper rate review/approval, AFAs, and more can all be automated in technology, but they must first exist. 

Once implemented, a cadence of review, reporting, and management can happen. 

A department’s next level of evolution would be to evaluate its matter management and collaboration requirements to determine if it needs further technology capabilities to support those needs. 

The evolution of legal services is on a trajectory toward transformative change, driven by a collective push toward value-based pricing models.

The legal industry’s growing preference for more predictable and transparent legal costs underpins the shift from traditional hourly billing. Alternative fee arrangements, including flat fees, contingent fees, or success-based fees, are increasingly preferred.

These models align outside counsel’s incentives with client outcomes and establish a partnership rooted in mutual success and cost-effectiveness. These forward-thinking pricing strategies are pivotal in promoting efficiency, ensuring cost certainty, and deepening alignment with client objectives.

Complementing this significant shift is the increasing role of technology in managing outside counsel relationships.

Advanced AI and analytics are reshaping the legal services landscape. Encouraging the adoption of Generative AI (GAI) by outside counsel is one way to drive operational efficiency.

GAI offers transformative potential in legal practice, from automating routine tasks to providing sophisticated analysis and predictions. Legal operations leaders can encourage outside counsel to integrate GAI into their services, highlighting its benefits in enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and innovative legal solutions.

Updating billing practices to reflect the efficiencies brought by GAI ensures that billing models are aligned with the advanced capabilities and time-saving features of AI technologies.

Outside vs. In-House Perspective

Understanding how outside counsel perceives management efforts from in-house teams is critical for fostering effective collaborations.

Surveys and feedback mechanisms offer valuable insights into these perceptions, revealing sometimes surprising expectations and views held by both parties.

In-house teams must comprehend what outside counsel values in a partnership, what they perceive as challenges, and their expectations regarding communication, transparency, and strategic alignment.

These insights often highlight areas where in-house management can improve, such as clarity in communication, responsiveness, or flexibility in approach.

For instance, outside counsel might value more detailed briefings on cases or appreciate greater autonomy in certain aspects of case management.

Conversely, they might expect more guidance or feedback in other areas. Understanding these nuances helps in-house teams tailor their management style to enhance mutual satisfaction and efficiency.

Building Trust and Knowledge

Successful legal partnerships are fundamentally built on the often overlooked but crucial emotional and intellectual connections that foster effective collaboration.

Building trust and fostering a shared understanding between in-house teams and outside counsel goes beyond transactional interactions, leading to deeper engagement and more productive outcomes. This relational approach can unlock new levels of efficiency and creativity in handling legal matters.

When outside counsel feels trusted and understood, they are more likely to invest more significant effort and thought into their work, leading to outcomes that may surpass expectations.

For in-house teams, acknowledging and valuing the human aspect of legal partnerships means going beyond mere expertise and experience to build relationships based on mutual respect and shared goals.

This approach enhances the quality of legal services and contributes to a more fulfilling and dynamic working environment for all involved.

The future of managing outside counsel is bright with potential.

It heralds a time where the confluence of technology, innovative pricing, and a focus on human relationships will fundamentally reshape how legal services are delivered and consumed.

For those willing to embrace these changes and adapt, the opportunities are boundless, setting the stage for a more dynamic, efficient, and equitable legal landscape.

# The Best Legal Brands In The World (2017)
## Are there any surprises on this Top 10 list?

Ever wonder what the best legal brand in the whole world really is? While measuring the impact of a brand may seem ephemeral, consulting firm Acritas conducts a survey of in-house counsel to measure the brands of global law firms. American Lawyer notes exactly how they go about their task:

Its criteria include name recognition, favorability, and the likelihood that the respondent would hire a firm for a cross-border matter.

Before we get into the nitty gritty of the ranking, one trend to note — big-name U.S. firms seem to be on a downswing:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Several big U.S. firms, including Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, Latham & Watkins and Sidley Austin, saw their brands drop in this year’s index.

Skadden fell one place to tie at 12th with Herbert Smith Freehills, while Latham went down one rung to 16th place, tied with Eversheds. Sidley Austin sank by three spots to No. 19.

Skadden might be the [strongest brand](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/the-best-law-firms-in-america-according-to-in-house-counsel/) in the United States, but that doesn’t mean they crack the Global Top 10.

“Some of the U.S. elite seem to be losing ground,” says [Lisa Hart Shepherd, chief executive officer of Acritas], noting that firms in the top 10 have a “very deep global spread.”

The very top of the Acritas Global Elite Law Firm Brand Index is much as it’s always been — Baker & McKenzie has topped the list since the inception of the ranking in 2010. There’s movement in the rest of the Top 10, though the firms remained the same.

# Firm Disappoints Associates With Bonus Announcement... Again

What’s worse than having to wait months for your bonus announcement? Getting a lackluster bonus announcement after waiting months for your bonus announcement!

Associates at Sheppard Mullin have sat on pins and needles waiting for bonus news since October because Sheppard employs the most [nonsensical bonus calendar ever](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/update-sheppard-mullin-doesnt-have-new-bonuses-they-just-have-a-weird-measure-of-time/). As a refresher, Sheppard ends its year on September 30 and then generally pays its bonuses sometime in March of the next year, meaning associates sit around for five to six months before they get the bonuses they earned months before. The firm claims associates like the billable year ending early because it keeps them from feeling last-minute billable pressure around the holidays. And maybe they do… but they’re definitely not fans of this unorthodox calendar then being used to screw them on bonus distribution. You can either end the year early or pay bonuses late. Doing both is just jackassery.

Earlier this week, before the announcement, a tipster wrote:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I’m an associate at Sheppard Mullin, and was told at our “state of the firm” meeting in January that SMRH is waiting until various other CA-based firms announce bonuses. They assured us they aren’t waiting for an excuse to pay less, they just “don’t want to start a precedent of being market leaders, just market matchers.” Our billable year ended on September 30, so at this point we’re coming up on 4.5 months after our bonuses were “earned.” It’s really getting frustrating, especially because partners obviously got their year-end distribution on 12-31, and they paid staff “profit sharing bonuses” 2 weeks ago. And yet, on the associate bonus front, it’s been radio silence.

There’s the dishonesty in the system right there. Ending the calendar after September robs the firm of even the stock excuse “we have to wait for collections before we can assess bonuses,” and it’s proven when they close out FY2016 for all the partners before calendar 2016 ends. At that point there’s no way around this being a cynical ploy to take advantage of associates who can’t wait around half a year for a bonus.

Alas, no sooner did we hear a complaint over the tardy announcement than the firm put out its bonus memo and found another way to infuriate its associates. Because the firm may call itself a “market matcher,” but that title requires some intellectual gymnastics to justify. The firm matches the market… assuming you bill 2200 hours. One tipster refused to play that game:

Same below market nonsense as last year.

2015-16	$15,000
2014	$25,000
2013	$50,000
2012	$65,000
2011	$80,000
2010	$90,000
2009	$100,000
For those billing 1950-2099 hours, not an uncommon year in Biglaw terms, first-year bonuses start at a mere $9,000 and those billing 2100-2199 have their bonus scale start at $12,000. As another tipster put it:

Basically, you’ve got to hit 2200 to get a market bonus (i.e., work about a month more than associates at peer firms to get market – #lame).

The firm does offer the tantalizing prospect of a discretionary bonus for “exceptional contributions” — though it immediately walks this back by noting:

However, discretionary bonuses are a small component of total bonus compensation.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Congratulations on your sort of bonuses, Sheppard associates. Hey, [at least you’re on the Cravath salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/wait-who-just-raised-associate-salaries/). That counts for something.

UPDATE: As should be expected, there are associates with contrary views:

I am a bit annoyed by the griping about our bonuses. I think, by and large, associates are quite content with the bonus scale. For one, the firm offers unlimited pro bono hours credit (in addition to what is essentially a credit for 50 free hours that can satisfied with things like summer associate interview lunches), so really, there’s no excuse for anyone who cares that much about a market bonus. Additionally, anyone with any perception of where the firm sits in the market (and, quite frankly, the firm’s overall fiscal approach) should find the scale fair, particularly in light of the fact we pay market salaries (which, yes, you did mention). Also worth noting that billers above 2400 hours get above market bonuses, and this is before any discretionary component.

# Which Law Firms Are The Best Places To Work In NYC? (2016)
## Which law firms are considered the cream of the crop in the city that never sleeps?

Since 2008, Crain’s New York Business has produced a list of the Best Places to Work in New York City. Each year, a few law firms sneak onto the list, much like the situation with Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For list.

This year, seven law firms made Crain’s list, while only [six made Fortune’s list](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/which-biglaw-firms-are-the-best-places-to-work/), as of March 2016. Just two firms overlap between Crain’s and Fortune’s lists.

Which ones are considered the cream of the crop in the city that never sleeps?

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Before we get to the top law firms to work for, let’s check out [Crain’s methodology](http://www.bestplacestoworknyc.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=43):

[Crain’s New York Business partnered with] Best Companies Group [to] conduct[] a simple yet thorough company assessment. The assessment is a two-part process designed to gather detailed data about each participating company. In part one, the employer completes a questionnaire and in part two, employees of the company complete an employee survey [with questions focused on everything from benefits to opportunities for advancement].

The collected information from the two instruments will be combined to produce a detailed set of data enabling the analysts to determine the strengths and opportunities of the participating companies. The workplaces are ranked based on this data.

We should also mention that there is a $199 fee to participate Best Places to Work in New York City ranking, with an additional fee on top of that if your company needs paper-based surveys. If you don’t pay, you don’t get to play, and you won’t be able to receive the bragging rights attendant with being a “best place to work for.”

These are the seven law firms on [Crain’s 2016 Best Places to Work in NYC](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20160928/SMALLBIZ/160929892/crains-unveils-the-100-best-places-to-work-in-new-york-city-in-2016) list:

- Cooley
- Drinker Biddle
- Frankfurt Kurnit
- Sheppard Mullin
- WilmerHale
Alston & Bird and Cooley are the only firms to appear on both Crain’s list and Fortune’s list. Congratulations to both firms for this high achievement. Getting people to fill out questionnaires (that you had to pay for, in advance) can be excrutiatingly painful!

Vivia Chen of [The Careerist](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/10/10/7-firms-not-on-wall-street-make-best-place-to-work-list/) had some color commentary on the Crain’s list:

[I]sn’t it curious how indigenous big New York firms seldom (actually, never) make those lists of “best” or “nicest” or “happiest” places to work? …

The only true New York firms are Adam Leitman Bailey, a real estate boutique, and Frankfurt Kurnit, an entertainment specialty shop.

So here’s the subtext: Big, powerful New York firms don’t need those “pleasant to work” awards. That’s for small fries and out-of-towners.

Have these rankings actually been earned? Can you think of a law firm that deserves to be recognized, but hasn’t been? [Email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Crain's%20Best%20Places%20to%20Work) or text us (646-820-8477) and let us know.

# Abusive Partners Are Still A Problem Firms Have A Hard Time Facing
## Firms are still behind on this.

The “screamer” was a creature that existed in law firm lore to terrorize new associates and staff. There was always some partner — or partners — within the firm structure whose book of business shielded them from common workplace courtesy. Screamers didn’t have to actually scream at anyone. Sure, there were tales of partners hurling objects out the window — or at other attorneys — but more often than not the abuse manifests in the sort of passive-aggressive dress downs that systematically undermine a person’s basic sense of self-worth.

While mental health initiatives are [getting some press these days](https://www.law.com/2019/06/17/law-firms-tackle-mental-health-one-initiative-at-a-time/), but these programs almost always focus on providing wellness services to those facing stress, without directly confronting those in management positions about treating employees better, and by extension, keeping stress down.

A series of tips received here at Above the Law — hodgepodged together into one cohesive narrative below — tell a story that, if true, would be a stark reminder that in Biglaw circles, management maintains a stigma when it comes to mental health and a significant blindspot when it comes to the possibility that a partner might be contributing to a hostile environment:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
An associate left the office in an ambulance. An abusive partner had pushed the associate hard for years and it apparently became too much on the latest matter. The group is dismissing it and trying to sweep it under the rug as the associate’s shortcomings because it was mental health related.

We’ve only heard from people sympathetic to the associate in this instance so we’re not going to speculate on the truth of the matter, but the fact that associates feel that the firm would not only downplay an abusive relationship, but would see mental health as an excuse to shift blame entirely upon the victim, speaks to the fractured sense of trust in the work environment. If mental health enters the vocabulary of the legal profession, it can’t come in only as a means to whitewash bad management.

In another story, [a legal secretary has filed suit over a pair of Venable partners](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/legal-secretarys-suit-claims-partners-tirades-constituted-sex-bias-caused-panic-attack) who “yelled, humiliated and demeaned her to such an extent that their conduct constituted sex discrimination under California’s fair employment law.”

“The days when an attorney can make enough money to excuse the verbal abuse and humiliation of the women that work for him are over,” the suit says. “Legal staff is not required to tolerate and even babysit lawyers through tantrums supposedly caused by ‘stress’ or ‘pressure.’ Verbal abuse and humiliation alter the terms and conditions of employment. When this conduct is directed at women, it is sex discrimination.”

While there are certainly scenarios where this sort of abuse comes from a place of gender dynamics and only targets women, this abuse is not always a matter of sex discrimination and it’s unfortunate that this rubric is one of the only effective means of addressing it. Too many instances can slip through the cracks when sex isn’t the clear impetus behind the abuse.

But more important than finding the right legal redress, firm leadership across the industry needs to get its act together and start holding peers accountable. There’s no amount of rainmaking that justifies keeping a hurricane in a corner office. We often point out that a law degree doesn’t necessarily provide business acumen, but it also fails to train management skills. Biglaw firms should start taking this seriously too.

Hey — who cares if Biglaw is white and male as long as it can charge [$2,000 per hour](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/2000-an-hour-lawyers-thats-one-way-to-fund-salary-increases/) (or more). It’s all about the money, after all. Isn’t it?

Of course.

As long as the profits keep rolling in, why should Biglaw care about gender equality? Yeah, I know – clients are starting to demand it; let’s see what happens. (The CEO of United Airlines probably had a similar lack of concern the other day about the [passenger dragged off one of his planes](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/united-passenger-lawyers-up-will-likely-re-accommodate-airline-in-court/), until the PR nightmare hit).

Escape From Alcatraz

I went “over the wall” and escaped from Biglaw; I know it as a grinding law factory that demands loyalty but is anything but loyal in return. “Collegiality” is probably the most overused, disingenuous word in the Biglaw recruiting lexicon, and I suspect that every Biglaw firm touts it as its number one quality – and many naïve (new) lawyers believe the pitch.

Yet likely no one who has ever plied the lawyer’s trade in Biglaw can say – if they are honest – that their firm is truly “collegial.” Fat fees and greed are the prevailing ethos – how can you afford to be “collegial” when “shareholder value” is the summum bonum?

The same is true about those more recent recruiting come-ons such as “family friendly” and “diversity and inclusion.” Such noble – but empty – words! Try counting the number of female partners or partners of color at Biglaw – see how diverse it really is. And how many lawyers with kids – male or female, but mostly female – who were smilingly promised “family friendly” hours were subtly hip-checked out the door for not billing enough after a respectable period of time had passed. I know a few.

Nothing must get in the way of billing, the billable hour, the almost-sacred realization rate, or profits per partner.

Certainly not you, lady!

Gender Pay Disparity

A 2016 “[fact sheet](http://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/workplace-fairness/fair-pay/4-2016-ny-wage-gap.pdf)” published by the National Partnership For Women & Families stated that in New York, women are paid 87 cents for every dollar paid a man. And recall the equal pay complaint of the [U.S. Women’s Soccer](http://employmentdiscrimination.fisherbroyles.com/2016/04/should-hope-solo-be-paid-less-than-clint-dempsey-isnt-this-employment-discrimination/) team?

So we know that women generally get paid less than men. What about in the law?

From Pilot and Above The Law  
A Major, Lindsey & Africa survey released in late 2016 found that women law partners average about 69% of the compensation of male partners. Above the Law also [reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/nyc-bar-report-reveals-minorities-have-a-60-higher-attrition-rate-asian-attorneys-leaving-at-an-alarming-rate/) at the time on the NYC Bar Association’s [2015 Diversity Benchmarking Report](http://documents.nycbar.org/files/NYC_Bar_2015_Diversity_Benchmarking_Report.pdf), which stated that “[d]espite more than a decade of New York law firms pledging to enhance diversity in their ranks, minority representation within associate and partners levels stalled last year, and attrition rates for female and minority attorneys remained disproportionately high.”

As the Law Journal noted, “Overall, firms are struggling to meet key statements in the diversity principles they signed onto, and women and minority attorneys are leaving at high numbers. Among all attorneys, 18.4 percent of women and 20.8 percent of minorities left last year, compared with only 12.9 percent of white men.”

Women take note – “While only 44 percent of current associates are white men, they make up 75 percent of current partners. … about 44 percent of associates are women, compared to 20 percent of partners.”

So it’s no surprise that women have [recently sued ](http://employmentdiscrimination.fisherbroyles.com/2016/09/what-do-at-least-5-biglaw-firms-and-the-u-s-womens-soccer-team-have-in-common/)at least five Biglaw firms for alleged pay disparity under the [Equal Pay Act](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm) (“EPA”).

Mansplaining and Manterrupting

And then there’s the harassment, and the “bro culture,” and the “mansplaining.”

Speaking of “[manterrupting](http://employmentdiscrimination.fisherbroyles.com/2016/09/handling-manterruption-and-bro-priating-in-the-oval-office/),” the New York Times defined it as “unnecessary interruption of a woman by a man.” Every woman I know has had this happen to her.

And apropos of that, did you catch the article in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/04/11/if-gorsuch-is-like-his-colleagues-hell-constantly-interrupt-the-female-justices/?utm_term=.f5dfaad3929d) this week reporting on a [law review study](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/it-doesnt-get-better-women-supreme-court-justices-get-interrupted-too/) finding that “Supreme Court justices are some of the most powerful individuals in the country, yet the female justices [find themselves interrupted](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/gender-dynamics-at-scotus-female-justices-interrupted-more-often-than-male-justices/) not only by their male colleagues, but also by their subordinates: the male advocates who are attempting to persuade them.… The situation only seems to be getting worse with more women on the court.”

So – do you think that gender pay disparity, harassment, and marginalization are mere incidentals, as opposed to an insidious inequality practiced society-wide – and ingrained in Biglaw as part of its longstanding model?

The “Iron Law” of Biglaw

Maybe it all adds up to the fact that the Biglaw model is, by its very history and nature, inherently unequal – unequal to all but the ruling few, who happen to be male and white. And for women – who were, after all, only allowed relatively recently into law schools, the ABA and Biglaw, it is even more unequal – and will continue to be.

First, consider the entrance requirements. The Ivy League law schools, being the Biglaw gatekeepers, select those who will “make it” in Biglaw, and train/brand/clone them to fit right in.

And they charge an indecent entrance fee to cull out the herd – enough to keep new lawyers indentured to Biglaw for many years – and long enough for Biglaw to make quite a profit until it sends (most of) them packing. It’s sort of like the relationship between college and professional sports, or the baseball minor leagues to MLB, or graduate instructors in college.

For its part, Biglaw must pay ever-higher salaries so that the associates can and will be enticed (or forced) to stay – and for which the associates are required to work on an assembly line that gets faster and faster each year (I once said “think Lucy Ricardo on the chocolate candy assembly line”). And for which client fees must be jacked up ever higher.

Takeaway

So – who gets the payoff? The big payday?

As always – follow the money. And the trail leads to a firmly entrenched cadre of power brokers.

And guess what gender and color they are?

# Allen & Overy And O'Melveny Are Considering Merger (Please Name It Allen & O'Melvery)
## Gigantic news in the legal industry as two major firms discuss transatlantic merger.

UPDATE: Now O’Melveny says they aren’t merging. [See update here](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/omelveny-tells-atl-we-have-no-plans-to-merge-and-never-have/).

Two firms that haven’t been shy about their interest in expansion are reportedly in “deep” discussions over a potential international merger. Magic Circle stalwart Allen & Overy and America’s O’Melveny & Myers are considering joining forces to create a new megafirm.

Christine Simmons and Rose Walker of the American Lawyer reported the nascent merger about an hour ago:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Allen & Overy and O’Melveny & Myers are in deep discussions about a potential combination, according to two sources briefed on the matter.

If a merger deal is finalized between both firms, it would create a 3,000-lawyer business with roughly $2.8 billion in combined gross revenue. Details of the talks, to date, have been contained to only a small number of senior figures, although Allen & Overy partners were told in January that the Magic Circle firm was in talks with several U.S. firms about a potential combination.

Would this influx of Americans cure [Allen & Overy’s atrocious gender pay disparity](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/another-biglaw-firm-reports-dismal-gender-pay-gap/)? I’m guessing no.

The tie-up would tread the well-worn path of previous cross-Atlantic deals like Clifford Chance’s takeover of Rogers & Wells, Norton Rose’s [takeover of Fulbright & Jaworski](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/11/law-firm-merger-mania-fulbright-jaworski-smells-sweet-to-norton-rose/) and [absorption of Chadborne](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/biglaw-merger-means-the-end-of-chadbourne-parke/), and [Bryan Cave’s merger with Berwin Leighton Paisner](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/another-day-another-transatlantic-biglaw-merger-to-create-a-1600-lawyer-megafirm/). It appears that in the sport of Biglaw, everyone wants to play in both courts (see, that’s a double entendre!).

But every merger is special in its own way, so we’ll have to wait and see how this one plays out. Swiss Verein? Acquisition? True Merger? It’s all a mystery to us at this point.

# How To Work Fewer Holiday Weekends In Biglaw
## Yes, it is possible to be a Biglaw associate (or staff attorney, or counsel, or partner) and not work every holiday weekend.

How did you spend your Memorial Day Weekend?  I’m willing to bet that, while many of your friends and family were traveling, BBQ-ing, and relaxing on the beach, you were stuck inside working on an assignment that you were told (or made to feel) *had to* be done over the holiday weekend, to meet client demands and/or partner expectations.  If this was you, and you’d like to work less (or not at all) on future holiday weekends, read on…

Yes, it is possible to be a Biglaw associate (or staff attorney, or counsel, or partner) and not work every holiday weekend (i.e., Friday through holiday Monday).  How, you ask?  The magic formula is:

strategizing + planning + optimizing optics =

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
greater likelihood of being off or working less on a holiday weekend

First, it’s important to emphasize that there are no guarantees in Biglaw.  Even using the “magic” formula, you may, and likely will, have to work some holiday weekends.  But you may be able to take some holiday weekends entirely off, and work fewer other holiday weekends than you have been historically, if you employ the magic formula.

Let’s take a closer look at the magic formula:

- Strategizing. Timing is everything.  Determine your end goal, work backwards, and strategize to make it happen.  Your goal is to not have to work over the holiday weekend.  Given the nature of Biglaw practice, you know that generally, if a draft document or other work product is with someone else, you won’t be able to or need to work on it at the same time.  Accordingly, your strategy ought to be to send the work product to the other person to review/deal with it shortly before the holiday weekend (but not too far in advance, such that they might dump it back in your lap right before or during the weekend).  Ideally, you’d send it sometime between Wednesday night through around noon on Friday before the holiday weekend.  That timing likely ensures that the recipient won’t have enough time to review it, comment, and send it back to you or request a phone call to discuss it between when you send it and when the holiday weekend ends.

- Planning. You can’t always plan your workload in Biglaw, but when you can, it usually pays to do so.  If you know you’re going to want to distribute work product sometime between Wednesday and midday Friday before a holiday weekend, then you’ll need to work backwards and plan accordingly to get the distribution ready before then.  Have you determined whose comments or sign-off you’ll need to distribute (if anyone), and allotted sufficient time for them to review and sign off?  Have you allocated at least a few hours (of your own time or staff members’ time) to proofread and format the document prior to distribution?  And keep in mind that deadlines are hard and fast for some, but not others, in Biglaw.  When you can build in some extra time “cushion” for yourself, it’s a good idea to do so.
plus

- Optimizing optics. Keep in mind the importance of “optics” in Biglaw (i.e., how something will look to others, such as your supervising attorney, client, or opposing counsel).  If you’re successfully going to pull off a work-free or reduced-work holiday weekend, and not have it come back to bite you later, you’ll need to optimize optics.  It’s a balancing act—the earlier you send a distribution during the window of Wednesday to midday Friday before a holiday weekend, the more likely it is it will get thrown back to you, and the later you send during that window, the more likely it is the recipient will recognize what you’re doing, label you disorganized, opportunistic, or a jerk, and try to “return the favor” on a subsequent occasion.
This magic formula works best when either: (i) you’re only working on one matter at a time (e.g., fully committed to one massive litigation matter) or (ii) you can get all of your matters/assignments to line up (e.g., all your transactions are moving at approximately the same pace and are at approximately the same stage).  That’s admittedly not always possible.

If you can’t secure an entirely work-free weekend, one other way to maximize your free time and minimize your work time during the weekend is to understand human nature, and align your working hours with others’ likely working hours.  In my experience, most people who are going to work some, but not all, of a holiday weekend, do so on Saturday morning and Monday afternoon.  If you know that the partner or client that you’re working with has this tendency, then plan to set aside a few hours around the same times, to do work and deal with requests that they send to you, and plan anything you want to be totally out-of-pocket for on Saturday night, Sunday, or Monday morning.

One final tip: travel at off-peak times, when it’s least likely to be disruptive/noticeable to your colleagues and clients, and you won’t have to deal with likely travel stress and delays.  (Biglaw is challenging and stressful enough, as it is!)  This might mean that you fly or drive somewhere on the Wednesday or Thursday night before a holiday weekend, work remotely for a few days, and then return on the Tuesday or Wednesday night after the holiday weekend (assuming your firm will let you work remotely, which is not a given, these days).  Or, you can plan to work in the office, but not in your usual office, if your firm will allow it.  For example, let’s say that you’re normally based in New York City, but want to spend the holiday weekend in the LA area, and your firm has offices in both cities.  You might work in the NYC office from Monday through Wednesday the week before the holiday, fly to LA overnight Wednesday-Thursday, work in the LA office Thursday and Friday, enjoy the holiday weekend through Monday in LA, work in the LA office Tuesday, and then fly home Tuesday-Wednesday overnight.  That way, you’re still satisfying your firm’s requirements to work in the (an) office a certain number of days a week, and are available to meet team and client demands during typical working hours, but you’re already in LA to enjoy your free time there over the weekend, in advance of the actual weekend itself.  Working in other offices is also a great way to connect with colleagues that you usually work with from afar, and to build your professional network.

# Despite Wildfire Tragedy, International Law Firm Decides To Hold Hawaiian-Themed Party
## The firm is donating to the Wildfire Relief Fund -- it's the very least they can do.

The scope of the Hawaiian wildfire tragedy[ continues to grow](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/maui-wildfires-missing-death-toll-biden-visit_n_64e360e6e4b09133924c43aa), with 114 confirmed dead and 850 still missing. Given the loss and devastation, it’s never been more vital to see Maui and the entirety of Hawai’i as more than just a tropical locale for tourists to frolic. Real people, not just some caricature of a vacation hot spot, are the ones suffering right now.

Against this backdrop, Addleshaw Goddard, a global law firm with 1,400 lawyers that’s headquartered in London, is holding a Hawai’i-themed party. In a baffling revelation, the [firm told Roll on Friday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-addleshaw-goddard-defends-hawaii-themed-party) they thought about seeming insensitive for using Hawaiian identity for their fun times in the face of human suffering, but ultimately gave it a big shoulder shrug and plowed on with their good time:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“In light of the terrible events in Hawaii we of course considered cancelling or trying to re-brand the event”, said the firm, “but decided after great thought and some consultation to go ahead explaining to staff earlier this week that it was not a thoughtless and insensitive decision but one to which we have given considerable thought”.

It’s just… so close to seeing the point, but ultimately it’s a swing and a miss.

The firm did note they’re holding a fundraiser to benefit relief efforts:

“Our thoughts are of course with the people of Maui”, said the firm, and now “a charity raffle will run on the evening with proceeds going to the Hawaii Wildfire Relief Fund and the Addleshaw Goddard Trust has also agreed to match fund”.

Obviously the donation is welcome, but you can’t just write a check and get away with bad taste. The firm denies that employees complained about the inappropriateness of the themed event, saying, “As far as we know, there have been no protestations from staff, certainly none have come to the attention of our senior leadership team.”

But the firm put “great thought” into the event and *still* decided to go with the Hawai’i theme. No one is objecting to a firm party, but out of respect for those dead, injured, and missing, put away the leis and grass skirts. That’s just unnecessary. You can — and should — still donate to the relief effort but opting for a different theme would seem the prudent way forward.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Associates Do Not Understand How Small Towns Work

You’re not that great, hotshot.

Ed. Note: This is an open letter crafted while watching a fifth-year associate from Biglaw World out of their element at a small town deposition.

Dear fifth-year associate they sent from Biglaw World to do this deposition:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Yes, I am the second youngest person in this room besides you. However, that I live in a smaller city does not mean your five years of experience are more valuable than my eight. Years at Biglaw firm are not dog years. I mean, while you may feel valued like a dog — not one of those froufrou dogs that fits in purses — your four years preparing statements of material facts to be reviewed by two layers of partners do not make you a better lawyer.

Also, practicing law is not professional baseball. That is to say, I live here because this is where I want to live. I am not somehow stuck wallowing in Double A while you are up there in the show. I don’t want to work there, in no small part because it would mean working with or in close proximity to you. Also, to the extent baseball and law are analogous, I am starting every day at Third Base while you get to pinch run once a week. And if this deposition is any indication of your relative skill, you just got thrown out at third by two steps in a 10-0 game.

Oh, sweet Jesus. Now you’re making speaking objections. This is not a parliamentary debate competition! You are not being judged for your capacity to worthlessly bloviate.

Well, I mean, that’s not entirely true. We, the other five attorneys at this table, we’re judging you. And we don’t like you. We have spent significant amounts of time forging a collegial bar. We like and respect each other. To the extent we make speaking objections, they are short and serve a discreet purpose. You, on the other hand, are still talking. That means that one of us is going to have to remind you of the rules of civil procedure… well, here I go.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Prestigious Biglaw Firm Enacts Global Work-From-Home Policy Over Coronavirus Concerns
## When will other firms offer work-from-home solutions so employees can remain safe?

Earlier this week, [Quinn Emanuel shuttered its New York office](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/quinn-emanuel-new-york-coronavirus/) after one of the firm’s partners tested positive for coronavirus, enacting a work-from-home policy for all of its attorneys and staff. A day later, Faegre Drinker [closed its offices worldwide](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/faegre-drinker-worldwide-office-closure-coronavirus/) and enacted a similar policy, if only for a short time, due to a coronavirus scare. All the while, attorneys and staff at other Biglaw firms were left wondering why their firms hadn’t taken any action yet when the technology is available to let them to do their jobs from safe spaces.

As luck would have it, another Biglaw firm has finally decided to allow its lawyers and staff to work from home — and the way they’re doing it is pretty interesting.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Yesterday, Weil Gotshal sent out a memo to let everyone know that the firm’s coronavirus policy had been updated to require mandatory work-from-home sessions on alternating weeks. To accomplish this, the firm will be split into two separate groups, with smaller groups venturing into the office every other week. The firm’s goal here is to minimize the risks of anyone contracting coronavirus through this social distancing program. Weil’s policy will be in effect until further notice.

Here’s an excerpt from the memo, which is available in full on the next page:

Work from Home:  Group A & Group B

Effective, Monday, March 16th, the Firm will assign all attorneys and administrative personnel into two groups:  Group A and Group B.  These groups will alternate working from home on a weekly basis (i.e., Group A will work from home the week of March 16th, Group B will work from home the week of March 23rd, etc.).  This is mandatory and may be adjusted as required outside the United States.  By Friday, March 13th, assigning partners and/or practice group leaders (for attorneys) and managers/supervisors (for administrative personnel) will inform members of their teams of their respective group assignment.

Any administrative staff member who believes that they cannot perform some or all of their regular job functions from home should consult with their immediate supervisor, who will be managing work flow and may be able to provide alternative projects.

Is Weil simply too big to have all of its personnel work from home at the same time? The firm has more than 1,100 lawyers and an untold number of staff. While this isn’t the perfect solution to the coronavirus exposure problem, at least Weil is doing something about it by offering all of its employees this option.

In this episode, I welcome [Imani Maatuka](https://www.sidley.com/en/people/m/maatuka-imani-n), a Commercial Litigation Associate at Sidley Austin, to talk about the Bridging the Gap Scholarship. Imani recalls what made her decide to follow in the footsteps of her other family members into the legal profession and what the big difference is between what she expected and the reality now that she’s working as a litigation associate. She describes how she picked litigation as the law area to specialize in. Additionally, Imani shares more information about the Bridging the Gap Scholarship: How it started, what their goals and steps to reach these goals are, and how it continues to help other students.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

There’s a cacophony of stupid out there calling for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to be arrested, presumably, being the source of the stunning call published by the Washington Post and Atlanta Journal-Constitution where a lame duck president of the United States leaned on state officials to interfere in an election to “find” him the votes he would need to win. We’ve [already dispensed with](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/donald-trump-drags-biglaw-firm-into-middle-of-election-interference-effort/) the idea that it was an illegal act of wiretapping (it wasn’t) and that settlement negotiations are privileged (they aren’t), but that doesn’t mean this conversation had to end up in the papers.

And the people responsible for this public firestorm are Donald Trump’s legal counsel.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It’s a stretch to describe this conversation as a settlement talk — the transcript reads much more like a meet-and-confer to deal with a laundry list of discovery requests — but that’s not really the point. Cleta Mitchell of Foley & Lardner took the President of the United States on a phone call where he could make potentially embarrassing statements about repeatedly debunked conspiracy theories at best and make explicit calls for election fraud at worst and didn’t lay the groundwork by getting a confidentiality agreement?

Just because the conversation wasn’t confidential by operation of law — [or “Man Code”](https://twitter.com/JesseKellyDC/status/1345885052350164992?s=20) — doesn’t mean it couldn’t have been confidential. This is a client who used to have every fling sign an NDA, how do lawyers walk him into a legal and political minefield without securing a confidentiality agreement first? Maybe Michael Cohen really was the brains behind the Trump legal universe all along. A Biglaw lawyer should have thought of this from jump!

Assuming this was a Biglaw effort, of course. For its part, [Foley & Lardner is trying to distance itself from Mitchell](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/01/04/lincoln-project-takes-on-foley-lardner-over-partners-role-in-trumps-call-to-georgia/), saying “[a]ny involvement [by Cleta Mitchell] in this matter is solely in his or her capacity as a private citizen.”

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Not sure that firms get to disavow partners running side gigs that easily. From ethical canons to malpractice insurance, there’s a whole litany of obligations that firms must shoulder based on the actions of any of their attorneys. It’s why one of the first things a firm tells first-year associates is that they can’t go around offering legal advice to their friends and family because they’re in a firm now. And it’s hard to sell [the contents of this transcript](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-transcript-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/2768e0cc-4ddd-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html) as anything but a member of their firm actively providing legal advice. For example:

Germany: We chose Cobb County because that was the only county where there’s been any evidence submitted that the signature verification was not properly done.

Trump: No, but I told you. We’re not, we’re not saying that.

Mitchell: We did say that.

That certainly sounds like someone preparing the filings.

But even if Mitchell wasn’t backed by the army of cautious senior associates who should have pointed out the need for some kind of confidentiality agreement, it should be lawyering 101.

So if Trump and his allies want to blame anyone for this tape getting out and hurting the president, they may want to blame their own counsel.

# Layoffs LITERALLY Decimate Am Law 100 Firm
## Ten percent of attorneys and staff on chopping block.

People have misused the word “decimate” for so long it’s entirely acceptable to use to describe any substantially destructive event. But, technically, the term describes a coldly applied 10 percent reduction. To be more specific, a Roman military punishment where a unit would draw lots and one-tenth of the soldiers would be executed to teach the whole unit a lesson for being involved in the failure of their officers.

Which sort of makes decimation the first layoff.

Fenwick & West — number 66 in the last Am Law rankings — issued its own little [Order 66](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Order_66) and started offing associates and staff today. And [according to Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/fenwick-west-laying-off-nearly-10-of-attorneys-staff), we’re looking at about 10 percent:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
After an “assessment of current and anticipated future demand,” the firm made the decision to reduce its workforce, firm chair Richard Dickson said in an email viewed by Bloomberg Law sent Tuesday afternoon. The reductions will affect “just under” 10% of the firm’s professionals, he said.

We believe in rounding and “just under” means it’s 10 percent. The firm knows these cuts round up too, or it would’ve written “just over 9 percent” because it just sounds way less horrible when it’s in single-digits.

Law firms are, by and large, reporting decent profits and slow but steady improvements in demand. Unfortunately, there are outliers and for the past couple years, those outliers tend to have deep ties to the tech sector. Fenwick fits smack in the middle of that cohort.

Which, for anyone keeping score, was also a Roman military unit.

So much for states' rights. [[Courthouse News Service](https://www.courthousenews.com/feds-sue-to-stop-california-bid-for-net-neutrality/)] * Law firms are merging at a record pace. This should probably worry people more. [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2018/10/01/law-firm-mergers-continue-at-record-pace-through-third-quarter/)] * This reads more like an exam question than real life. Is it a trademark violation to spell fiance as Feyoncé when selling engagement gifts? What if we add that they also sold stuff that references ""Single Ladies""? [[Law360](https://www.law360.com/newyork/articles/1088036/beyonc-can-t-shut-down-feyonc-merchandise)] * Sidley Austin earns less than the midlevel exception. Or about what Chris Dudley was worth. [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/10/01/labor-department-filing-reveals-big-sidley-payday-in-basketball-dispute/)] * The Supreme Court is open for business.

# NY To $180K: The First Major Match
## What you've been waiting for: a match of the Cravath scale from a large New York law firm.

Sure, it was lovely when [Hueston Hennigan matched the new Cravath salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-firm-bumps-associate-salaries-to-match-180k-scale/) Monday night, but we know what you’ve all been waiting for. Elite litigation boutiques in California are nice and all, but what are the major players in New York going to do on associate base salaries?

We now bring you the first major match. [Milbank Tweed](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/milbank-tweed-hadley-mccloy/) — a definite Biglaw firm, [Am Law 100 and NLJ 350](http://www.americanlawyer.com/law-firm-profiles-result?firmname=Milbank+Tweed+Hadley+%26+McCloy&slreturn=20160507104204), with more than 600 lawyers and $700 million in annual revenue — has matched the [Cravath salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1).

This doesn’t come as much of a surprise. You’ll recall that in the last bonus season, Milbank matched Cravath [within an hour](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-the-first-cravath-match-wow-that-was-fast/). This time, on salary news, Milbank waited until the next day. What took them so long? 😉

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Our Milbank sources are pleased:

- “Milbank definitely tries it’s best to appreciate associates, and while it’s not a comp leader it has always been committed to paying the top of the market. It’s also really nice that the firm ensures we don’t have to wait around too long to hear.”
- “Welcome news. I’m happy to be working at a firm that recognizes how important it is to be on par with its peers to retain the best talent.”
Congrats, Milbank associates, on the enhanced salaries!

UPDATE (11:10 a.m.): An important point raised by a reader: “Which offices does the Milbank raise cover? That would be big news if we now have the raise spreading to non-NYC offices.”

It seems to cover all of Milbank’s U.S. offices — specifically, Los Angeles and Washington as well as New York. The memo does not contain “NYC only” language, and the email transmitting the memo got sent to #LA Associates and #DC Associates as well as #NY Associates. So this bodes well for the Cravath pay raise spreading beyond New York. (Recall that Cravath itself has only New York and London offices.)

UPDATE (11:20 a.m.) For anyone who’s interested, I’ll be on CNBC’s [Power Lunch](http://www.cnbc.com/power-lunch-cnbc/) at around 2:15 p.m. today to talk about the Biglaw pay raise news. Please tune in if so inclined!

UPDATE (3:37 p.m.) In case you’re wondering, yes, incoming Milbank associates (class of 2016) will be getting the new $180,000 salary. They recently received this information from recruiting: “The Executive Committee announced an increase to our associate salary scale earlier today; the memo is attached. The annual salary for the Class of 2016 will be $180,000.”

UPDATE (6/8/2016, 1:37 p.m.) Consistent with [Paul Weiss and several other firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-raises-spread-to-summer-associates/), Milbank will be paying its summer associates at the new going rate for first-year associates:

## Some firms are willing to devote resources to make sure their employees have access to abortion.

Of the most elite Biglaw firms — the Am Law 100 — 76 have offices in [states that have banned or severely limited access to abortion rights](https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/10/26-states-are-certain-or-likely-ban-abortion-without-roe-heres-which-ones-and-why) in the wake of [the Dobbs decision.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/the-end-of-roe-is-here/) Biglaw’s rapid expansion into Texas sure looms large. For those thousands who work at those firms (and folks who work at other firms that key their benefits off of what the top of Biglaw does), the VERY important question is — what are they going to do about it?

Sure, things like pro bono opportunities and devoting the firm’s mighty resources to the fight for abortion rights is incredibly important — vital even. But let’s take it out of the esoteric and talk about the actual folks working at those firms who are finding out right now that they’re pregnant. What will those firms do for employees who suddenly find themselves cut off from abortion, and potentially a wide range of fertility treatments?

All sorts of [major companies are making news](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/tech/companies-abortion-reaction/index.html) for stepping up for their employees and covering travel expenses for those who wish to access abortion care. Will Biglaw do the same?

Above the Law reached out to Am Law 100 firms that operate offices in locations (all 76 of them) where abortion has already been banned/restricted to find out what their plan is — they did have eight weeks ([from the leak of the draft decision](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/unprecedented-scotus-leak-shows-just-how-little-respect-the-court-has-for-you-know-precedent/)) to figure it out. We’ll be updating the chart as we learn more details. Not only is it vital for folks currently working at the firm, but as law students begin the recruitment process in a few months, they can use this info to find out what kind of firm they’re considering working for.

And please, if you know information drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Travel%20Costs) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Travel Costs”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

And if your firm fails to come through, maybe Dick’s Sporting Goods’ legal department is hiring.

# Am Law 100 Firm Announces Associate Raises On The Davis Polk Scale
## But will the firm re-raise salaries?

Associate raises continue to spread like wildfire through Biglaw. Firms are eager, particularly given the hot lateral market, to show associates how much they’re valued with some cold, hard cash.

Last week, Kramer Levin,  a firm with $390,000,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it 98th on the Am Law 100, announced associate raises. The new scale — tipped off of the one Davis Polk popularized — is below:



The increases are retroactive to January 1, and will hit associate bank accounts mid-March. But, as noted above, these raises are from last week — before Cravath upended the salary scale. So is another round of raises in the cards for Kramer Levin associates? Only time will tell. (Ahem, Kramer Levin associates, be sure to  [tip us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) if and when the firm makes another compensation move.)

You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/kramer-raises-22/2/)

# Midlevel Biglaw Associates Want Offices With Windows, And They Want Them Now
## The struggle is real.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

If someone is not coming into the office regularly (and unless there is a legitimate reason such as parental leave), then they should not have a window office. There are many window offices that are empty because the associates are working unofficially fully remote or come very rarely into the office. And there are many associates that come into the office regularly (2, 3, 4 times a week) and sit in their window-less, depressing offices. That doesn’t make sense. It used to be that offices were assigned based on seniority … If you don’t come in, then don’t take the light from the rest of us! Thank you.

— An anonymous Am Law 100 associate’s response to a question found in the [American Lawyer Midlevel Associates Survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/22/associates-say-the-darndest-things-2023-edition/) about the one thing they’d tell the managing partner of their firm if they could.

No one wants to be fired from Biglaw… especially not in a public way that garners [industry headlines](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/chadbourne-kicks-out-partner-suing-them-over-gender-discrimination/). But that’s exactly what happened to [Kerrie Campbell](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/kerrie-campbell/). The now former partner at the firm [formerly known](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/chadbourne-parke-is-dead/) as Chadbourne & Parke filed a[ gender discrimination](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/) case against her firm. The ensuing litigation has been [juicy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/chadbourne-class-action-lawsuit-gets-juicy-af-lawyer-fires-back-against-criticism/), but well before the final brief has been filed, Campbell found herself voted out of the partnership.

So… now what?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Campbell decided to hang out her own shingle, launching [KCampbell-Law, PLLC](http://kcampbell-law.com/) this week. And she’s using her fight against Biglaw as motivation for the next step in her career:

“It’s time to stop talking about gender inequality in law firms and start doing something to stop it,” said Campbell. “That’s why I am deeply committed to the legal fight for gender equality and why I started a woman-owned firm.”

Her practice focuses on handling  high-profile reputation, regulation, defamation, commercial speech and unfair trade practice matters for a variety of different clients with something she calls “grit, with grace”:

In 30 years as a lawyer, I have represented public figures, private individuals, iconic brands and companies in the U.S. and abroad in matters involving reputation, regulation, defamation, commercial speech and unfair trade practices,” said Campbell. “It takes grit to effectively represent clients under siege, and it takes grace to efficiently resolve complex issues in the heat of a firestorm of publicity, controversy, emotion and high stakes economic and reputational threats. Grit is in my DNA. Grace comes from learning, experience and humility. My clients benefit from both.

“Grit, with grace” — that’s a better motto than the Biglaw mantra, “tears with bonuses.”

It’s great to see Campbell taking the lessons learned over the course of her very public fight with Biglaw and applying them to the next phase of her career. We wish her all the best in this next chapter.

“Work all winter, shine all summer / Ride for your brother / You die for your mother / Keep that sh*t a 100.” — Drake

With the on-campus interviewing (OCI) season right around the corner, I thought this was a perfect time to go into our archives and publish a yin-and-yang type article for this summer’s law firm interviewees.

The first part of this article is taken from a column we published a few years back: [7 Epic Examples Of On-Campus-Interviewing Fails](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/7-epic-examples-of-on-campus-interviewing-fails/?rf=1). Here are 5 things you definitely should not do during OCI this summer:

- Knock-Knock
A 2L knocks on the door of an interview room when it’s his turn. Instead of waiting, he walks right in. The interviewer and the student being interviewed both look up, shocked. The student says to them, “MY turn,” and just stands there. The interviewer, after getting past the initial shock, asks to have a couple of minutes to finish up the first interview. The student looks at his watch, pauses, and says, “Well… I suppose….”

Student goes out to callback lunch with partners and associates. Waiter comes to the table and approaches the student first.

Waiter: “Can I get you something to drink?”

Student: “Yea, I guess . . . I’ll have . . . a . . . vodka redbull.”

-Rest of table looks at him in shock.-

He, again, says, “I’m just kidding!! . . . I’ll just have a long island.”

-awkward laughter at table-

No offer.

- The People Person
Interviewer asks inevitable, everyone-is-prepared-for-it question: “What do your consider your weaknesses to be?”

Candidate (stratospheric GPA to offer and little else): “Well, I don’t really like other people very much.”

Job not offered.

- “Forget it, Jake, it’s Koreatown.”
I was conducting a callback lunch interview in Los Angeles when the interviewee starts talking about how he can’t stand living in Koreatown because Koreans were so rude and also bad drivers.

I said, “Dude, my last name is Kim. You know I’m Korean, right?” After an uncomfortable ending to the lunch I called HR and told them if they gave this kid an offer I was quitting. Needless to say, no offer for this guy.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
- Internationally Confused
I was set on working abroad, so I made sure during OCI that I had interviews set up for every firm that indicated it had a foreign office. London, Paris, Hong Kong.

One firm had listed Vienna as one of its offices, but I was so thick that I didn’t realize that it was Vienna, VA (I’m from the West Coast – who ever heard of Vienna, VA?) Of course, my answer to the question “Why are you interested in our firm?” referenced my belief that I could end up working in Austria. That was sure embarrassing.

#PART II — OCI TIPS
The second part of this article is taken from a previous column: [OCI Is Around The Corner; How Can Law Students Ace The 20-Minute Interview?](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/11-tips-for-the-biglaw-interview-day/?rf=1) which is based on a great series of hiring partner Q&As conducted by Vivia Chen, [The Careerist’s](http://www.americanlawyer.com/the-careerist) chief blogger — to reveal what firms are looking for in summer associates. Here are 5 tips from Biglaw hiring partners to ace the interview process:

- What impresses you in an interview?
Some of the most memorable interviews have been with people who’ve worked with the Peace Corps or Teach for America or went to graduate school. We’ve had great successes with people for whom law is a second career. — Tom Leatherbury, [Vinson & Elkins](http://thecareerist.typepad.com/thecareerist/2010/06/vinson-elkins-hiring-partner-spills-the-beans.html)

- Can we talk about memorable interview moments–good and bad?
I’d rather focus on the positive. The positive ones are those who know a lot about our firm and show drive and interest. Anyone who realizes this is a service business gets a lot of points. — Leigh Ryan, [Paul Hastings](http://thecareerist.typepad.com/thecareerist/2010/07/paul-hastings-hp.html)

- Ever had a candidate who was great on paper but who blew the interview?
Yes. The ones who were totally unprepared and knew nothing about Skadden. Someone asked us about our T&E practice, which we don’t have. — Steven Glaser, [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom](http://thecareerist.typepad.com/thecareerist/2010/06/skadden-hp-.html)

- What turns you off about a candidate during an interview?
If I sense entitlement; if they think they’re better than their colleagues or if they are too focused on themselves. — Gregory Shumaker, [Jones Day](http://thecareerist.typepad.com/thecareerist/2010/05/jonesdayhiring.html)

- How do you figure out [the qualities in a potential new hire] in a 20-minute interview?
We engage in substantive conversations. We ask them about their law review notes or their judicial clerkships. You can gauge a lot from how someone explains what they’ve worked on. — Karen Popp, [Sidley & Austin](http://thecareerist.typepad.com/thecareerist/2010/08/sidley-austin-hp.html)

So there you have it: 5 things you definitely should not do and 5 tips to help you succeed during this OCI season. If you are curious about what a summer experience at a law firm is like, the Wall Street Journal’s Sara Randazzo wrote an excellent piece covering this: [For Summer Law Interns, The Livin’ Is Easy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-summer-law-interns-the-livin-is-easy-1436229949).

If you’re interested in additional tips for this OCI season, be sure to also check out ATL’s past piece by our Anonymous Recruitment Director: [11 Tips For The Biglaw Interview Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/11-tips-for-the-biglaw-interview-day/?rf=1).

As thousands of you are approaching OCI, remember it is much better to be prepared than to be embarrassed. I hope that your interviews go swimmingly. But if for some reason they don’t go as planned, ATL is here for you to share your experiences.

Good luck! And please don’t break a leg during a cocktail reception.

# Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries, But Doesn't Quite Match Market

More news from the salary war front. And this dispatch is more than the typical repetition of the Cravath, MoneyLaw scale for all of its offices. Locke Lord has given all of its U.S. associates raises, but how big your payday is depends on where you are working.

The firm announced today that they’re moving associates in “large markets” in the U.S. to a $180,000 scale, and we have another Biglaw firm refusing to make [across the board](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/?rf=1) salary increases. Let’s take a look at Locke Lord’s offices (the ones marked with an asterisk are deemed “large” by the firm):

Boston*
Chicago*
Cincinnati
Dallas*
Hartford
Houston*
Los Angeles*

Good for first years in those markets pulling down the money, but not everyone is happy. Though the firm has yet to release the year-by-year raise breakdown, senior associates seem to be getting the shaft. Locke Lord has said it is increasing large market associate salaries by $20,000-$30,000, depending on year, but on the Cravath scale, 7th and 8th year associates are making an extra $35,000 as of July 1.

Don’t cry too much for associates in “small markets,” first year salaries will be bumped to $155,000, and all associates in those offices will get a bump of $10,000-$15,000 depending on class year.

The firm has said it is still evaluating pay raises for international offices, summer associates, and junior partners.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Chicago! Time To Get Your Raises!
## With the second Chicago-headquartered firm to drop, we can expect the rest of the city to shrug its broad shoulders and match soon.

I don’t know why you’re releasing a bonus announcement after 5:00 p.m. on Friday. Don’t you want people to know that your firm is not a cheapskate? Aren’t you proud? Just because Trump has decided that Friday evening is a totally acceptable time to release news, doesn’t mean you have to.

Oh, wait, as of this writing, it’s not after 5:00 p.m. in Chicago. Okay, that makes slightly more sense now.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Sidley Austin is here, folks. Kirkland & Ellis [kicked off raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/kirkland-has-spoken-can-we-now-declare-the-salary-wars-over/) for firms headquartered in Chicago, yesterday. But Kirkland can sometimes be a special case so you couldn’t be sure that the rest of Chicago would follow.

Sidley Austin is not a special case. It’s just a giant firm with a couple of thousands lawyers that is a market indicator by sheer force of size. If Sidley is doing it, all the other Biglaw firms in Chicago pretty much have to.

Sidley matched the Cravath scale, and the Simpson special bonuses.

I’m going to put the full memo on the next page, because Sidley is eating into my weekend and it’s pissing me the hell off.

# Soon-To-Be Mega Firm Announces Salary Raises
## Merger news isn't the only big thing happening here.

Fresh off of the news that Holland & Knight and Thompson & Knight are due to merge, effective August 1 ([no, they will not be called Knights Unlimited or something similarly catchy, much to my dismay](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/biglaw-firms-to-merge-miss-ultimate-in-branding-opportunity/)), the firm has more news to announce.

Yesterday, Steven Sonberg, the firm’s managing partner, let associates know there’s a new pay scale in town for the soon-to-be combined firm which will shortly boast 1,600 lawyers in 30 global offices. Yes, it’s the familiar DPW compensation grid for associates. Welcome to the top of the market.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Back in May, the [firm announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/hk-salary-increase-2021/) it was moving to a lockstep compensation system for all its U.S. offices. So, yes, this is for all those offices. The raises will be effective August 1st, though as Sonberg notes, there’s a slight (two month) catch:

The effective date for the increases will be August 1, the same date as the effective date for the merger with Thompson & Knight. Because of the timing of the merger and a number of other related factors, while the increases will be retroactive to August 1, the actual date on which payment will occur will be delayed until on or about September 30. This delay will enable the firm to ensure that associates and other impacted senior counsel and advisors, from both firms are treated in a consistent manner, allow for appropriate individual communication, and finalize financial matters associated with the merger.

Still, mighty good news for associates.

You can read the full memo [from the firm on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/holland-knight-raises/2/)

# Baker McKenzie Announces There Will Definitely Be COVID-19 Cuts. But Exactly What They Are, Who The Hell Knows.
## Firm: Salary cuts are coming! Employee: How much? Firm: We'll tell you later.

Talk about amping up the anxiety! I’m sure the folks at Baker McKenzie are trying for transparency, but the effort leaves something to be desired.

According to multiple tipsters, the North American offices of Baker McKenzie had an all-hands conference call today. The message was clear — pay cuts are coming. But the specifics weren’t revealed, and firm leadership said exactly how much their paychecks would be impacted would be revealed next week. And tipsters aren’t happy at this partial reveal:

The rather tactless announcement left everyone reeling over the lack of specifics…which will no doubt carry over into every employee’s holiday weekend.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The amount of the planned salary cut is plainly important. During the course of the COVID-19 austerity measures, we’ve seen a wide variety of pay cuts implemented — some as low as 5 percent and others as high as 30 percent. The difference in take-home pay between those extremes could easily be the difference between being able to make your mortgage payment and being unable to swing living expenses.

While the exact pocketbook impact remains a question, we do know that both staff and attorneys making over $100,000 are on the chopping block. But as a tipster revealed, at this point, the firm intends to institute true-up bonuses when this whole mess is over and has kept the door open for high-biller bonuses.

The town hall also revealed the firm has no current plans for economic layoffs. But, in the opinion of one tipster, the phrasing of the announcement leaves the door open for the dreaded stealth layoffs:

Also mentioned that this should result in no layoffs “for pure economic reasons”… wording and emphasis on that felt suspicious to me that layoffs for other reasons may be coming.

We reached out to the firm, but they did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

Hopefully those at the firm will be able to weather the coming salary cuts, no matter how large they may be.

# Get Ready For The Biglaw 'Rooney Rule' As Firms Try To Actually Do Something About Diversity
## But will it actually improve law firm diversity?

It looks like Biglaw firms are finally moving from the rhetoric of diversity to that reality. [Thirty firms](http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/files/mansfield-rule-release.pdf), including DLA Piper, Paul Hastings, Jenner & Block, Morrison & Foerster, Blank Rome, and White & Case, have committed to abiding by a version of the “Rooney Rule” when promoting and hiring laterals. For those that have no more than a passing familiarity with the concussion-fest that is the NFL, the Rooney Rule — named after the late owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Art Rooney — requires teams to interview at least one minority candidate when there is a head coach or general manager vacancy. The rule is seen as a progressive success — yes, [eight minority head coaches](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/01/13/rooney-rule-8-minority-head-coaches-for-2017/96554502/) is seen as a success — and now Biglaw firms are taking a cue from the NFL. (I know — in a week that saw Colin Kaepernick drummed out of the league for making a political statement, it’s a little jarring to see NFL and progressive in the same sentence, but here we are.)

The idea was proposed by Mark Helm, a partner at Munger, Tolles & Olson, at Diversity Lab’s event, Women in Law Hackathon. Diversity Lab then worked with the firms to develop the rule, and as[ reported by](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/06/07/mansfield-rule-eyes-a-big-law-diversity-breakthrough/) Law.com, they are committed to making sure the law firm rule is successful:

“These law firms have signed on [to] help us form the idea, put it into fruition, see what works, see what doesn’t work,” said Caren Ulrich Stacy, CEO of the Diversity Lab, which is working with the firms to develop the Mansfield Rule. “We’re going to stick with the firms and we’re going to help them measure and track and then [see] where the needle has moved over the course of the year so that its second iteration next year could be even better.”

The Biglaw version of the rule, named the Mansfield Rule after Arabella Mansfield, the first woman admitted to practice law in the U.S. (a good fact to remember for a future Trivia Question of the Day), asks firms to consider two or more candidates who are women or attorneys of color when hiring for leadership and governance roles, promotions to equity partner, and hiring lateral attorneys. And, if the firms can demonstrate 30 percent of the pool for these positions are diverse, they’ll be “Mansfield Certified.” That spiffy designation will allow firms to participate in a client forum hosted by 45 in-house legal departments, including companies like Facebook, HP, Microsoft, and PayPal.

The participating firms seem committed to the Mansfield Rule, and are hopeful it will yield real results:

“It has been demonstrated again and again that diverse teams make better decisions. While we aspire to create those teams everywhere, including and especially in leadership, it is also well documented that unconscious bias clouds our best intentions,” said Fenwick & West managing partner Kathryn Fritz in a statement to The American Lawyer. “The Mansfield Rule helps us bring greater intention to our considerations and actions so that we can achieve our aspirational goal.”

There also is a sense that an industry-wide solution is what’s needed, as the Wall Street Journal [reports](https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2017/06/07/a-rooney-rule-for-law-firms-project-aims-to-promote-more-women/):

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Alan Hoffman, the managing partner and chairman of Blank Rome, said the firm is thrilled to participate in the pilot because “we’re not retaining women in the practice at the same rate as men.” Blank Rome began in 2012 trying to get more women in line to take over practice group leadership, and now half of the firm’s 16 practices are led by women.

Orrick Chairman and Chief Executive Mitch Zuklie said the rule looks to be a promising way for law firms and their clients to come together to hold the industry accountable and is emblematic of the fact that “systemic problems require systemic solutions.”

Also taking part in the pilot program is Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, and that named Rooney is the son of the NFL owner who worked towards diversity in professional football:

“My father would be proud to know that we are working together as a community to transition the Rooney Rule into the legal profession. He was a true believer in diversity and collaboration, so this is the perfect way to honor his legacy,” Art Rooney II said. “I am thrilled to support and take part in such a large and meaningful effort – with so many prestigious law firms – to diversify the legal profession at the highest levels.”

The firms participating are definitely on the forefront of diversity initiatives, hopefully there’s enough momentum to get the rest of Biglaw on board.

# Partners Could Hurt Clients If They Don't Let Associates Argue Motions
## Partners often don't know as much about cases as their associates. Let them shine in court and please your clients in the process.

It is very difficult to gain courtroom experience as a junior litigation associate.  As this website has previously discussed, partners are typically unwilling to give associates the chance to argue motions and gain hands-on litigation skills.  Partners usually believe that they have more litigation experience, and as a result, clients would be best served if the partner and not the associate argue motions or conduct other courtroom tasks.  Of course, there are certain situations in which partners with more experience are better able to serve a client’s interests by conducting various litigation tasks themselves.

However, many times, partners actually do their clients a disservice by arguing motions or conducting other litigation tasks on their own rather than have an associate do this work.  Of course, associates usually have a lower billable-hour rate than partners, and it is typically more expensive for a partner to go to court than an associate.  Moreover, associates also usually have more detailed knowledge of a particular matter than a partner, [and might be better suited to argue a motion or conduct other litigation tasks themselves.](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/extra-money-main-job/)

While I was working in Biglaw and at smaller shops, I saw partners frequently handle litigation tasks themselves rather than give this work to associates.  In many instances, this was to the detriment of clients.  While working at a large, international law firm, almost every court appearance was handled by partners.  Usually, it was even the top partner in my office who would argue motions and head to court, since it was seen as a power symbol or some kind of honor to be the one who appeared in court.  On some level, it made sense that only the top brass at my Biglaw firm would head to court.  I worked on extremely large matters, and corporate clients likely wanted a trusted practitioner before the court instead of someone who was more junior.

However, the top brass at my Biglaw shop did not understand the intricacies of certain legal matters as well as more junior partners and associates.  The most senior partners who argued the vast majority of the motions held administrative functions within the firm, spent a large portion of their time schmoozing with clients, and oversaw numerous cases.  Since their time was so precious, top partners had very little involvement in researching most motions, and I don’t think that some of the most senior partners even knew how to use online legal research platforms!

This was an issue, since partners couldn’t rely on their own research when making court appearances, but had to use memos prepared by associates.  It is definitely dangerous to heavily rely on research summaries prepared by others, since the research could be flawed, and memos present information through the lens of the author.  In any case, the lack of time and attention top brass spent on certain matters, and the fact that partners did not do their own research, definitely affected the performance of these partners at oral argument.  I definitely believe that in many instances, a junior attorney who had been more involved in the case [would have done a better job handling many of our court appearances](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/balance-side-hustles-main-job/).

Even partners at smaller firms sometimes make court appearances themselves [rather than delegate this work to associates](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/stress-strategies/).  When I left Biglaw and started working at a smaller firm, I almost always argued each of the motions and appeals that I drafted.  Unlike in Biglaw, appearing in court was not seen as some kind of honor to be cherished by the top brass, and the person who drafted papers (usually associates) typically argued the motion.  This was because the person who drafted the papers was usually the most knowledgeable about a matter and would presumably do the best job at oral argument.

However, there was one occasion in which I drafted summary judgment papers for a client from out-of-state, and the client’s outside counsel flew to New York for oral argument.  Because the client traveled thousands of miles to hear arguments on the motion, the partner decided to argue the motion himself.  Of course, I understand putting your best face forward by having a partner handle an appearance when the client is looking.  But the partner who argued the motion had hundreds of cases to supervise, and was involved in a number of other non-legal activities.  This partner was not too familiar with the complicated procedural history of the case or the nuanced arguments presented in our motion papers.

The other side presented a solid case at oral argument, and used the partner’s inability to answer the judge’s questions against us.  In the end, we lost the motion, and this was still the only time in my career that a plaintiff won summary judgment against a defendant in a commercial matter.  If I had argued the motion, I don’t think I would have been able to win summary judgment against the plaintiff, but I think my deeper understanding of the case would have convinced the court that a material issue of fact existed warranting the denial of plaintiff’s summary judgement motion.

All told, when partners usually think about letting associates argue motions, they typically feel that they are doing associates a favor by allowing them to sharpen their skills.  In reality, partners are often doing their clients a favor by letting more junior attorneys make court appearances.  Indeed, associates are usually more involved with cases and have sufficient time to ensure that motions are argued as persuasively as possible.

# We Told You The Biglaw Salary Increase Was No Big Deal
## Things were better -- or at least more lucrative -- in 2007.

Inflation is a b*tch. That’s the takeaway from a[ new article](https://www.law.com/2018/08/22/despite-salary-hikes-inflation-leaves-associate-pay-below-pre-recession-level/) by Scott Flaherty on American Lawyer which compares the new Biglaw gold standard starting salary — $190,000 — with the 2007 going rate — $160,000, adjusted for inflation. Guess what? Things were better in 2007. Actually, at any point over the last 20 years the buying power of first year associates was greater then it is now, in 2018.

But things really hit a high in 2007. The 2007 $160,000 starting salary translates to $199,185 in 2018 dollars. See, it’s not just your imagination, pre- the mortgage back securities debacle really was the heyday for the legal industry. The money was great, the jobs were plentiful, and it seemed like the good times would never end. (The last one turned out to be a bad miscalculation.)

Flaherty crunches the numbers:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Adjusting 2007’s starting salary for inflation, the $160,000 figure becomes $199,185 in June 2018 dollars. That means, in effect, first-year associates earned the equivalent of $9,185 more in 2007 than those who followed the same path in 2018.

Salaries adjusted to June 2018 dollars remained above that $190,000 mark into 2008 and 2009, even as the global recession set in. As the starting associate pay remained at $160,000 for several years starting in 2007, the CPI-adjusted figures steadily dropped until 2015, when they were equivalent to a little more than $172,500 in June 2018 dollars.

Then came an increase to $180,000 in 2016—the equivalent of roughly $191,450 in June 2018—and, eventually, the 2018 hike to $190,000.

We are [early on the train](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-the-milbank-raise-is-not-that-big-of-a-deal-and-why-it-is/?rf=1) that the salary raises of 2018, while nice for associates, weren’t anything ground breaking. So the next time [a client grumbles](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/i-hope-in-house-lawyers-are-enjoying-these-raises-since-their-clients-are-going-to-be-the-ones-paying-for-them/) about all the money that associates make, just remember, Biglaw salaries aren’t even keeping up with inflation.

# Biglaw Firm Plagued By Exodus Of 100+ Lawyers Suffers Another Blow As Its Chair Steps Down
## The firm is now completely revamping its management model.

Hot on the heels of a [defection en masse](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/becker-ranen-partners-defection-lewis-brisbois/) led by a group of departing partners, Lewis Brisbois is staring down another yet another issue: its founding partner and co-chairman is stepping down.

Robert “Bob” Lewis, 86, founded the firm in 1979 and was one of the longest-serving chairs of any Am Law 100 firm. Bob Smith, the firm’s remaining co-chairman, said Lewis is a “titan of the legal profession,” and that the firm looks forward to Lewis’s continued “wisdom and guidance” in his new role as chairman emeritus.

In the wake of Lewis’s decision to leave his position, Lewis Brisbois will be dissolving its executive committee and creating a new management model. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/04/lewis-brisbois-chairman-bob-lewis-steps-down/) has the details:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Lewis Brisbois is creating an expanded management committee comprised of 13 members.

Elections will be held on May 9 for five new members, after which the expanded committee will elect a managing partner and other top managing or administrative partners as necessary, [a statement from Smith] said. …

“For some time now, we have held discussions about altering our management structure,” Smith said in the statement. “Rarely does there seem to be a good time to introduce meaningful change. Recent events, however, have created new opportunities for Lewis Brisbois to expand, grow, strengthen and change our management team.”

“Change is a positive,” Smith continued. “What won’t change is our steadfast focus on delivering outstanding counsel and results to our clients.”

Up to 140 lawyers are [expected to leave the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/becker-ranen-partners-defection-lewis-brisbois/) — which is currently ranked at No. 70 in the most recent Am Law 100 — to join Barber Ranen, a boutique employment firm that was recently opened by John Barber and Jeff Ranen, veterans of Lewis Brisbois who led its employment practices group and served as members of its management committee.

Smith doesn’t seem too troubled by the news, announcing in his statement, “We will miss our colleagues who have left, but we know we will continue to share clients with them, while we rebuild our employment capabilities in California.”

# Biglaw Firms Gets In On The Associate Raise Game -- PLUS -- Bonus News
## Associate raises are still happening!

Though the powers that be at McKool Smith haven’t come forward with an announcement of lockstep associate raises or bonuses, that doesn’t mean the attorneys there are stuck in the old salary scale forever. According to tipsters at the firm, the individual notifications went out at the firm and most people seem very pleased.

Based on our information, the annual end-of-year bonuses are in line (at least on average) with the [bonus scale set by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/) last month. But the really exciting news is that the firm is moving to the new [$190K salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) that became all the rage during this summer’s salary wars. And those raises will be retroactive to July 1, meaning associates will get a lump sum payment — styled as a special bonus — that makes up the difference between their old salaries and [the new scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/).

That’s some great holiday news indeed!

# Twitter’s ‘Cost Cutting By Not Paying Bills’ Now Going To Increase Legal Fees
## How to destroy a company.

It’s no secret that Elon Musk is desperately trying to cut costs at Twitter, the company he overpaid for and saddled with approximately an extra billion dollars a year in interest payments by leveraging the buyout. He’s cut staff somewhere around 75% and we still keep hearing rumors of further cuts. He’s [turning off data centers](https://www.techdirt.com/2022/12/29/it-took-just-four-days-from-elon-gleefully-admitting-hed-unplugged-a-server-rack-for-twitter-to-have-a-major-outage/) as well. Though, as part of all this, he’s also [driven away a huge percentage](https://www.techdirt.com/2022/12/22/elon-appears-to-admit-that-hes-driven-away-40-of-twitters-advertisers/) of Twitter’s revenue, as well as any sort of momentum towards growth.

A month ago, the NY Times noted that one of Musk’s cost savings techniques [appeared to be to just stop paying Twitter’s bills](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/technology/elon-musk-twitter-shakeup.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur).

To cut costs, Twitter has not paid rent for its San Francisco headquarters or any of its global offices for weeks, three people close to the company said. Twitter has also refused to pay a $197,725 bill for private charter flights made the week of Mr. Musk’s takeover, according to a copy of a lawsuit filed in New Hampshire District Court and obtained by The New York Times.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

There are also a bunch of other stories about not paying law firms and a variety of other vendors as well. Last week there were [more details on the “data center closure” order](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/29/technology/twitter-elon-musk.html) from Musk which, as we had heard rumored, was done haphazardly with little advance planning or care.

Elon Musk’s orders were clear: Close the data center.

Early on Christmas Eve, members of the billionaire’s staff flew to Sacramento — the site of one of Twitter’s three main computing storage facilities — to disconnect servers that had kept the social network running smoothly. Some employees were worried that losing those servers could cause problems, but saving money was the priority, according to two people who were familiar with the move but not authorized to talk about it.

Of course, for most people, not paying your bills is not seen as a “cost cutting” move, it’s called ruining your credit and risking all sorts of downstream problems. I guess when you’re filthy stinking rich (even if you’ve [lost more money than anyone ever](https://news.yahoo.com/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-first-145155563.html) in history), it’s called “renegotiating.”

But I do wonder if this kind of “cost cutting” may come with a lot more additional costs than someone like Musk has realized. We’ve already talked about the very real threats [from the FTC](https://www.techdirt.com/2022/12/26/elon-musk-claims-hes-not-worried-about-the-ftc-he-should-be/) and [the EU](https://www.techdirt.com/2022/11/16/if-you-thought-the-ftc-was-going-to-fuck-over-elon-just-wait-until-he-learns-about-the-eu/) cracking down on Twitter for violating various laws and agreements. Those can come with massive fines.

But also, all this “cost cutting by not paying the bills” seems to be turning into lawsuits. Twitter is [closing down its offices in Seattle entirely](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/facing-eviction-twitter-closes-seattle-office-reports-say/), as it’s facing eviction for not paying rent. The few remaining employees were apparently told to work from home, which is at least mildly amusing coming less than two months after Musk [gave everyone an ultimatum](https://abc7news.com/elon-musk-twitter-return-to-office-employees-blue/12444456/) to return to the office immediately.

But now there’s at least one landlord who is suing. Columbia REIT, which manages 650 California in San Francisco, [is suing the company for unpaid rent](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23561523/twitter-rent.pdf). This is not Twitter’s headquarters (where it’s also been reported the company is not paying rent) at 1355 Market Street. Rather this was some office space that Twitter took over when [it purchased](https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/twitter-buys-mobile-dsp-crossinstall-as-it-prioritizes-performance-ads/) mobile advertising tech firm CrossInstall in 2020. That deal came with the lease on CrossInstall’s offices at 650 California St. Rather than actually use the space, Twitter apparently has been subletting it out to Dentsu, but Twitter is still responsible for the rent.

From the documents, it appears that Dentsu pays Twitter slightly less than what Twitter has to pay the REIT for the space. So, based on this, it is possible that not only is Twitter not paying the rent, which may screw over Dentsu, but it may be taking the money from Dentsu in the meantime.

Still, I imagine these types of lawsuits are going to start to add up, and the legal bills associated with them may start to be even more costly than, you know, paying for the basic things Twitter promised to pay for. Musk may think he can get away with that by also not paying the lawyers, but there are few professions I know of that get more pissed off about being stiffed on bills than lawyers.

He’s Elon Musk, so maybe he’ll get out of all of this as well, but it still strikes me that there was always a less costly way to do this: don’t immediately fire everyone, spend some time figuring out where you can cut costs, put in place some real effort to retain existing revenue, and then work on ways to renegotiate other contracts while still paying your bills.

Otherwise, this “just not paying any bills” and having to sort it out in court almost feels like a non-bankruptcy bankruptcy, but without any of the protections and orderly process of an actual bankruptcy. It seems like a ridiculously costly way to “cut costs.”

# Oops! Biglaw Partner Sent Private Strategy Presentation To Adversary In 'CC' Snafu

As an attorney, I made the “inadvertent email” mistake just once. Thankfully, it was an innocuous note about an associate lunch to co-defendant’s counsel because they had the same first name and Outlook trades expediency for common sense if you don’t turn off its “suggested recipients” feature with extreme prejudice.

It’s unclear if it was a “suggested recipients” problem or a “reply all” issue, but Proskauer partner Michael Lebowich, representing the New York Times, made a similar mistake recently. Except instead of accidentally inviting another firm partner to lunch, [he sent his adversaries a private strategy presentation](https://www.thedailybeast.com/ny-times-lawyers-accidentally-send-private-strategy-memo-to-staff-union). All the news that’s fit to print doesn’t stop for management’s confidentiality concerns!

Tech workers for the Times are unionizing and rather than voluntarily recognize the union like a reasonable entity, the newspaper demanded a vote to buy management time to undermine the effort before election day.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Right now, the paper is fighting over the scope of the possible union. As the Daily Beast reports:

In one slide, titled “Operating Principles,” the lawyers discussed management’s potential goals, including ensuring supervisors are not involved in the union, seeking the “smallest bargaining unit that is justifiable,” or seeking “the bargaining unit where we are most likely to win an election” that would effectively defeat the unionization effort.

The larger potential union might actually allow the paper to “win” the election by expanding the pool of voters and increasing the chance that enough senior workers might sell out junior workers by rejecting the union. On the other hand, a smaller union would almost certainly have the votes to form, but would cabin the impact on management. Proskauer advises the latter strategy.

This isn’t hugely surprising. The Daily Beast spoke with an organizing member of the union who found it valuable that counsel advised the paper to more or less concede the union as inevitable and work to limit its size as opposed to risking a larger unit in a fight to defeat the effort wholesale. Though, honestly, the workers probably sussed this out as a likely strategy before getting this slide deck. It’s not like union busting is a new industry — the tactics are well-established.

But what might actually muck up Proskauer’s client from this presentation is a slide purporting to show union support among the workers. The graph breaks down workers into different departments and shows the level of backing for “leans yes, leans no, on the fence, and unknown.” This suggests management is polling employees on their thoughts about the union which happens to be [totally illegal](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/interfering-with-employee-rights-section-7-8a1). The union has filed complaints with the NLRB.

Which all goes to show how important it is not to get careless with your carbon copies, lawyers! Every email is a time bomb for your clients — unless you’re emailing lunch plans — so don’t skimp on the protections. To be extra careful, you can even create a rule that holds all sent messages for 30 seconds (or more) to give the sender enough time to have an “OH CRAP” moment before the message actually hits the ether. There are a ton of bells and whistles in the software that lawyers can use to stay safe.

And if Proskauer has trouble figuring out how to implement any of these tech fixes, I’m sure there’s a tech staffer at the Times more than willing to demonstrate how valuable they are.

If associates are smart, they will take what work they can and make themselves busy. If things do get worse, firms will look at overall productivity. You never want the associate who always has time, because there’s a reason for it. I think those will be the most vulnerable people.

CHECK OUT THE UPDATE: [Brown Rudnick is backing away from Ye.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firm-passes-on-representing-kanye-west-after-rapper-refuses-to-back-away-from-antisemitic-remarks/)

Kanye West’s never been one to steer away from controversy, but lately it’s gotten even worse. He launched antisemitic attacks on social media that got him booted from Twitter, and teed up [buying Parler](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/yes-buyout-of-parler-looks-very-much-like-a-failed-company-taking-advantage-of-troubled-rich-guy/). [He spread](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/19/1129747423/kanye-west-george-floyd-lawsuit) vicious, unfounded rumors that it wasn’t former police officer Derek Chauvin that caused George Floyd’s death but rather fentanyl — and as a result is facing a $250 million lawsuit. He wore a [“White Lives Matter” shirt](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/kanye-wests-white-lives-matter-drama-everything-to-know/) to his Yeezy fashion show. He’s been [dropped](https://jezebel.com/balenciaga-has-officially-dumped-kanye-west-1849687883) by Balenciaga and his Adidas contract is “[under review.”](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kanye-west-ye-adidas-antisemitic-comments-adl-anti-defamation-league/)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Ye’s troubles have clearly branched out beyond the public relations sphere and into legal woes. As such, [TMZ is reporting](https://www.tmz.com/2022/10/21/kanye-west-hire-johnny-depp-attorney-camille-vasquez-amber-heard-yeezy-business/) Ye hired a Biglaw firm to represent his “business interests.” He’ll be working with Brown Rudnick and specifically partner [Camille Vasquez](https://brownrudnick.com/people/camille-m-vasquez/). Vasquez’s [rising legal star](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/fan-favorite-lawyer-in-johnny-depp-case-gets-promoted-to-partner-at-her-biglaw-firm/) recently translated to pop culture relevance during her[ successful representation](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/fan-favorite-lawyer-in-johnny-depp-case-speaks-out-after-verdict/) of Johnny Depp in his defamation case against Amber Heard.

While Vasquez will potentially be involved in a variety of mounting Ye legal troubles, one court battle she’s staying out of is his custody case. The rapper [recently hired](https://www.tmz.com/2022/09/28/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-melinda-gates-divorce-lawyer/) Robert Cohen — who represented Melinda Gates in her divorce from Bill Gates — and Nicholas Salick in his ongoing dispute with ex-wife Kim Kardashian. This is Ye’s sixth set of attorneys in his family law case.

We’ll see if Vasquez has more lasting power as Ye’s attorney.

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. While we’ve heard of countless instances of discrimination and sexual harassment that have occurred since the results of the election were announced, this one is beyond the pale. Today, we’ll take a look at the ways in which sexual harassment and assault at law firms have been amplified in the days since the election of Donald Trump. This is a real email that we’ve received from a real reader.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I am a paralegal in an Am Law 200 firm in the south. I am of Hispanic descent. My colleagues and I regularly face unwanted sexual remarks made by associates and sometimes partners, but they’re usually said in hushed tones, either behind our backs, or sometimes as they walk away from our desks. Despite their attempts to remain quiet, we’ve always caught bits and pieces of the foul things they’ve said about us. So-and-so is a piece of ass. You’d like so-and-so as your side piece. You bet so-and-so sucks a mean dick. You want to get so-and-so in your office and fuck her good. So-and-so won’t be able to say no if she wants to keep her job.

Thankfully, these comments were never made directly to our faces. We thought they knew better.

In the days since Trump has been elected, the situation has become almost unbearable. These vile, highly sexual comments that were once whispered are now spoken in full voice. Associates had always allowed their hands to brush against us, if briefly, but never like this. Some of us, myself included, have been touched inappropriately.

Yesterday, an associate took his opportunity as I bent over to retrieve a binder, his hand cupping my rear, his fingers dipping lower in an attempt to touch my most intimate areas. Sensing one of my colleagues approaching, he pulled away, grunting, “Next time, I’ll grab you by the pussy, beaner.”

Are we to be preyed upon like this for the next four years? Have these men forgotten that they’re lawyers? What has our country become?

This story is absolutely horrifying. If you work at a law firm where things like this happen, please report those who are involved to HR, immediately. Do not wait for this situation to escalate any further than it already has. Please take action, NOW.

Do you have a law school or law firm story you’d like to see appear in The Pink Ghetto? Please [email me](mailto:staci@abovethelaw.com?subject=The%20Pink%20Ghetto) with “The Pink Ghetto” in the subject line (or find me on Twitter: [@StaciZaretsky](https://twitter.com/stacizaretsky)). You will be kept anonymous. Submissions are always welcome.

As ATL noted yesterday for the first time since the Great Recession, the revenue per lawyer, or RPL, as tracked by [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202768367950/For-the-Worlds-TopGrossing-Firms-Slow-and-Steady-Growth?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL)‘s Global 100 has taken a dip. And that dip is caused by a single law firm:

What could have caused this decline in revenue per lawyer? We’ll refer to this as the Dentons dip. As noted by Am Law, thanks to the firm’s mega-merger with Dacheng — a firm 4,000 lawyers strong — RPL for the entire Global 100 sank like a stone. But for the Dentons Dacheng merger, the Global 100’s RPL would have increased by 0.2 percent, to $841,346. However, while 23 firms saw an increase in RPL of over 5 percent, more than a third experienced declines in 2015 — the most since the Great Recession. This could be a trend worth watching over the course of this year.

And it’s becoming clear that this market shift is far from typical, as Big Law Business [reports](https://bol.bna.com/one-mega-firm-dragged-legal-industry-ranking-report/):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Bruce MacEwen, a law firm consultant who has been outspoken about The American Lawyer financial rankings, said that he’s never seen an entire metric skewed by a single law firm.

“That is new to me,” he said. “It had to happen, sooner or later, because these firms are getting so big.”

But as MacEwen does note, Dentons’ unique structure, that of a verein — different law firms that work under the same brand — also plays into their surprisingly low revenue per lawyer.

Now Dentons has responded to American Lawyer’s report. Perhaps unsurprisingly the firm takes the position that this metric doesn’t reflect the quality of the firm or the work they do:

As you know, Dentons has a longstanding policy of not commenting on the accuracy of estimates of Dentons’ global financial performance made by the media. However, this story reinforces a point that we have made consistently: focusing on global averages of financial figures such as RPL or PEP reveals virtually nothing regarding the legal profession, the quality of a firm or its success. The wide variance in economic standards across the multiple regions served by a global law firm makes such global averages meaningless. The American Lawyer’s observation that one large firm can change the average by itself demonstrates our basic point — averages often disguise meaningful information, not provide it. Dentons continues to measure its success through the integration, growth and innovation initiatives that enhance our service offerings to clients, not the pursuit of irrelevant metrics.

Biglaw associates may have just [gotten raises](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/), but any comparison to the dark days of 2008-09 can be a scary one. For the sake of associates, and their student loans, let’s hope Dentons is right and this isn’t a sign of bad things to come for the industry.

# Morning Docket: 11.13.17
## * Per recently filed FEC paperwork, the Republican Party's campaign arm has severed financial ties with would-be Alabama senator Roy Moore thanks to his allegedly pervy predilections. If there's no grass on the field, the GOP won't play ball, but this man will probably still be elected. [[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/senate-gop-campaign-arm-severs-financial-ties-to-roy-moore)] * Starting today, members of the public will be able to access briefs and relevant case documents from the Supreme Court's website for the first time in history. This will be pretty cool for a day or two, and then people will go back SCOTUSblog, to the OG of high court documentation. [[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/the-supreme-courts-next-cautious-careful-move-into-the-digital-age/2017/11/12/c724eef6-c7cd-11e7-b0cf-7689a9f2d84e_story.html?utm_term=.fe8c148f374b)] * After seeing a five-year nose-dive, the number of LSAT-takers has ticked upwards ever so slightly over the course of the past two years. Law schools are probably thrilled given the dearth of quality applicants, but this is likely little comfort for the LSAC given the unexpected rise of the GRE.

* Per recently filed FEC paperwork, the Republican Party’s campaign arm has severed financial ties with would-be Alabama senator Roy Moore thanks to his allegedly pervy predilections. If there’s no grass on the field, the GOP won’t play ball, but this man will probably still be elected.

* Starting today, members of the public will be able to access briefs and relevant case documents from the Supreme Court’s website for the first time in history. This will be pretty cool for a day or two, and then people will go back SCOTUSblog, to the OG of high court documentation.

* After seeing a five-year nose-dive, the number of LSAT-takers has ticked upwards ever so slightly over the course of the past two years. Law schools are probably thrilled given the dearth of quality applicants, but this is likely little comfort for the LSAC given the unexpected rise of the GRE.
