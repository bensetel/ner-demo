# One More Angel In Law Firm Heaven
## After nearly 65 years, Dickstein Shapiro LLP is no more.

We mentioned it [yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/non-sequiturs-02-11-16/), but Dickstein Shapiro is no more. The firm, which has been in [troubled waters](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/the-biglaw-firms-with-the-biggest-drops-in-attorney-headcount-2015/) since 2013 when it first started seeing a mass exodus of attorneys, has been [desperately seeking](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/dickstein-shapiro-finds-a-firm-to-rescue-it-from-certain-death/) a [merger partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/has-dickstein-shapiro-found-a-new-rescuer/) for quite a few months. While dreams of a full merger were not to be, Blank Rome has acquired over 100 “assets” (read: attorneys) in a mass lateral move.

The nature of the acquisition allows Blank Rome to get all of the talent that made up Dickstein Shapiro, with none of the debt. A win/win for the Philadelphia-based firm. As [reported](https://bol.bna.com/blank-rome-acquires-dickstein-shapiro-lawyers/) by the Big Law Business blog of Bloomberg BNA:

Such “asset acquisitions” ensure that the acquiring firm doesn’t take on obligations — such as real estate leases and other payments — left behind by the firm being acquired.

In these types of deals, a representative is typically appointed to oversee the winding down of the firm’s affairs. The Dickstein Shapiro site listed Jim Carroll as a contact person for inquiries concerning Dickstein business matters.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And the nearly 65-year-old Dickstein Shapiro LLP is no more. As their [website](http://www.dicksteinshapiro.com/) clearly states, they are “no longer engaged in the practice of law.” While this is generally good news for those associated with the firm, especially those attorneys now working at Blank Rome that no longer have to worry about the solvency of their employer, not everyone is thrilled with the news. As the National Law Journal [reports](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202749558392/Dickstein-Shapiro-Closure-Heartbreaking-to-Name-Partners-Daughter#ixzz3zy6lQi6y):

[Claudia Shapiro Taskier, daughter of firm founder David Shapiro] had known the news was coming for months, if not years.

“I’d had some time to think about it. It’s heartbreaking for me,” Taskier said to The National Law Journal on Thursday night. “I’m very glad Dad and Sidney [Dickstein] are not alive. They would have been heartbroken over what happened the last three years.”

For their part, Blank Rome seems happy with the arrangement. This expanded version of Blank Rome will have over 620 lawyers and expects to see its gross revenue balloon. In a statement, Blank Rome’s chairman Alan Hoffman crows about the acquisition:

“It is amazing to think that just 15 years ago, Blank Rome was primarily a Philadelphia law firm,” said Alan J. Hoffman, Blank Rome’s Chairman and Managing Partner. “In line with our current strategic plan, this is the latest in a robust series of targeted lateral hires, acquisitions, and combinations that our Firm has successfully completed in recent years. As Blank Rome celebrates its 70th anniversary, we are excited to help our clients tackle the full range of their most critical legal challenges now and for decades to come.”

And while true that beggars can’t be choosers, former Dickstein Shapiro chairman James Kelly seems happy with how it all shook out:

“We have long admired Blank Rome’s deliberate and steady evolution, and its commitment to delivering top-level service to its clients,” said James Kelly, the new Chairman of Blank Rome’s Washington, D.C., office and former Chairman of Dickstein Shapiro. “The group of attorneys and professionals joining Blank Rome are proud of the success we have had in serving our clients and building premier, market-leading practices. We are excited to continue serving clients together with our new colleagues at Blank Rome.”

Best of luck to the bigger and better Blank Rome. Hopefully the move won’t lead to many growing pains.

# Introducing The Complete Legal Tech-To-English Dictionary!

There’s a term for when attorneys use Latin words and arcane terminology to describe legal processes to consumers: “legalese.”

But there’s no similar term for when vendors use technical and other arcane terms to describe their legal software operations to lawyers.

True, this dynamic may seem unfair. But now we have The Legal Tech-to-English Dictionary to help us cope.

Adapted from a series of Above the Law articles by the legal technology expert Jared Correia, this free, tongue-in-cheek guide to the world of legal tech includes plain language explainers, dramatizations of key themes, and links to comparison resources.

We hope this dictionary brings you up to speed on all things technology, while providing a few laughs along the way.

# Former Biglaw Partner Caught Doing Long Stint In Traffic Court. At The Bench. Because He's A Judge There Now.

Many an optimistic soul has had their ten-year plan derailed by the combination of keeping up with the Joneses and looking down to see golden handcuffs. We all know at least one member of our cohort that somehow went from a personal statement about the importance of fighting for the little guy to making 6 figures doing… not that. The betrayals start small: I’ll work long enough to pay off my student loans becomes long enough to pay off the house becomes “Well someone has to put the kids through school” — and at that point your 35th work anniversary is just around the corner.

In what should be motivation for many, a top Quinn Emanuel partner had enough guts to finally get to the giving back part of his career. From [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/top-quinn-emanuel-partner-starts-over-as-traffic-court-judge):

[Stephen] Swedlow, 52, last year left Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan after winning a seat as a judge in Illinois’ Cook County. The longtime Chicagoan has been presiding over DUI trials and traffic violations in the city’s downtown Loop for most of the past six months.
…
Swedlow put up nearly $1 million of his own money for the privilege to toil at the lowest levels of the state’s judiciary. After leading a massive litigation that could net his former firm $185 million in fees, he’s making about the same as what Quinn Emanuel pays its first-year lawyers.

“People in Big Law say to themselves, ‘If I just get to this number, I can stop,’” Swedlow said in an interview, referring to how much money is enough to walk away. “So I made up a number. I got to that number, and I made up a new number. And then I got to that number, and I decided to stop and go into public service.”

“I think most people just keep making up new numbers,” he said.

Listen, once you get to the point where you can sink a cool million to wag your finger at people who got caught speeding, its safe to assume that your nest egg looks more like a baker’s dozen. And what do you get the man that has everything? Either a good story or a new experience, and Swedlow is getting his fair share of both at the new gig:

“It’s a totally, totally different experience from having two dozen associates who’d do everything administratively that I’d need done,” Swedlow said. “Before, I’d only go to a Zoom meeting that somebody sent me a link to. Then I became a judge and I had to organize the Zoom, create the breakout rooms. I became a Zoom master.”

Happy judging, Swedlow! I wish you as many jury trials as your heart can take. Don’t forget to keep up with your disclosures when it’s time to hand in that paperwork. Only Supreme Court justices get a pass on that sort of thing. Well, not [Kagan](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/kagan-bagels-clarence-thomas-rcna83707), she actually does what ethics require of her. I’m not trying to say any names or anything. Ok, I’m talking about [Clarence](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/judiciary-thomas-ethical-lapses-2012/), [Alito](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/supreme-court-justices-financial-disclosures-thomas-alito/), and [Gorsuch](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-head-bought-neil-gorsuchs-property-in-2017-yes-we-are-just-learning-about-it-now/). Don’t pull one of those.

If you’re trying to write a crypto bro character and came up with something approaching the real life Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF, natch), you’d get mocked for being too on the nose. But here we are.

The erstwhile CEO of crypto exchange FTX  is in a whole mess of legal trouble — most notably [his indictment on fraud](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/samuel-bankman-frieds-criminal-indictment-and-civil-lawsuits-could-provide-enhanced-tax-benefits-to-those-who-lost-money-on-ftx/) and related charges. He’s been [scaring away lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/paul-weiss-backs-the-hell-away-from-messy-ftx-litigation/) and[ talking to the press](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/sam-bankman-fried-keeps-talking-a-lot-against-advice-of-counsel/) despite advice from the counsel he does have — all this despite having two [prominent law professors](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/sam-bankman-frieds-parents-no-longer-on-the-stanford-law-school-course-calendar/) as parents.

Now,[ Forbes reports](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/?sh=23373ba83c47) on the testimony SBF prepared to give before Congress… until he got arrested the day before. Some of the[ juiciest revelations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/the-11-juiciest-parts-from-sbfs-draft-testimony-to-congress/) in the testimony deal with Biglaw firm Sullivan & Cromwell. S&C repped FTX as outside counsel, and the company’s General Counsel, Ryne Miller, is a former partner at the firm.

SBF’s testimony alleges Sullivan as well as Miller, pressured him to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections using tactics that “range from adamant to mentally unbalanced.”

Most of that pressure came from Ryne Miller, the General Counsel of FTX US and a former partner at Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C), and Sullivan and Cromwell itself.

Sullivan & Cromwell was one of the primary external law firms that represented FTX US as well as FTX International at the time.

I have 19 pages of screenshots of Sullivan & Cromwell, Mr. Miller, and others I believe were influenced by them, all sent over a two day period, pressuring me to quickly file for Chapter 11. They range from adamant to mentally unbalanced. They also called many of my friends, coworkers, and family members, pressuring them to pressure me to file, some of whom were emotionally damaged by the pressure. Some of them came to me, crying.

The testimony goes on to further allege Sullivan made promises to SBF it didn’t keep:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
During the time I was being pressured to file, Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers told my counsel that I would get to choose the board chair. Sullivan & Cromwell silently reneged on that a few days later.

SBF also planned to testify that his efforts to back out of appointing John Ray, who he describes as “famous primarily for his work for the Enron bankruptcy estate,” were stymied by Sullivan & Cromwell.

At roughly 4:30 am on November 10th, 2022, against my better judgment, I clicked on a Docusign link that would nominate John Ray as the CEO of various entities.

Less than 10 minutes later I received a potential funding offer for billions of dollars to help make customers whole.

A few minutes thereafter I instructed my counsel to rescind the document; it had become clear to me that it was not the best way forward.

My counsel informed me a few minutes later that it was too late to rescind it, and that Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers were submitting it on my behalf despite my instructions not to.

Roughly 6 hours later—more than ample time to change course— Sullivan & Cromwell filed the document with the court against my express wishes and stated orders.

Of course, by the time FTX filed for bankruptcy, the company’s shortfall had [reportedly grown](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/18/how-sam-bankman-fried-ran-8-billion-fraud-government-prosecutors.html) to $8 billion.

Listen, Sullivan & Cromwell hasn’t — and given you know, attorney client privilege, probably won’t — commented on the matter. But all the various strands of FTX litigation seem bound to get messy… and isn’t it fun for us that Biglaw is wrapped up them.

# Catholic Church Turns To Biglaw To Stop Child Sex Abuse Victims Act
## The Catholic church knows the value of having a Biglaw firm on its payroll.

When you sign up to be a Biglaw attorney, you probably know you’ll be asked to do things you may find unsavory. But the job isn’t about your conscience or personal set of morals, it is about providing the highest quality legal services to those who can afford [the rates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/how-much-would-you-pay-for-the-very-best-lawyer/). But helping the Catholic church with its child abuse problem still might be a bit much.

The Daily News [reports](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/catholic-church-hired-lobby-firms-block-n-y-kid-rape-laws-article-1.2655010) that, according to filings with the New York State Joint Commission on Public Ethics, the state Catholic Conference — the public policy voice of the church, led by Timothy Cardinal Dolan — paid Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker over $1 million between 2007 and 2015 for its lobbying services. The firm worked on issues related to “statute of limitations” and “timelines for commencing certain civil actions related to sex offenses,” as well as other issues such as parochial school funding and investment tax credits.

New York is considered by child abuse victim advocates as having one of the most restrictive statutes of limitations, and there have been numerous efforts to change that, though they’ve all failed to become law. The Daily News reports that with the help of their Biglaw big guns (as well as other noted lobbying and media firms, such as Patricia Lynch & Associates, Hank Sheinkopf, and Mark Behan Communications), the Catholic Conference has historically been able to fight off the effort to expand child sexual abuse laws.

The good(?) news for Wilson Elser is that they are out of that business, though it doesn’t look like it was their choice:

After several key people either left the firm or reduced their responsibilities, the Church did not renew the contract with Wilson Elser for 2016, sources said.

Wilson Elser, which was being paid $10,000 a month by the Catholic Conference, had no comment.

But the Catholic church knows the value of having a Biglaw firm on its payroll, and has engaged another firm for its lobbying efforts:

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

It’s Friday night… need something to celebrate? How about some raises and special bonuses to go around?

Hogan Lovells associates around the country got welcomed news this evening when they learned their firm was the latest to join in the great associate raises of 2018. Associates in California, Baltimore, Houston, Philadelphia, New York, Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia will fully meet the top of the industry base salary standard, known around these parts as the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale. Boston associates will get raises in the same dollar amounts as their peers — the office is currently on a lower scale — of $10,000 – $25,000 depending on seniority. And, come January of 2019 the office will move to the scale the rest of the U.S. associates enjoy.

Below is the new compensation scale for all your gawking pleasure:

Plus, there are summer bonuses!



The special bonus is being assessed on the firm’s normal 2,000 billing target, annualized through June. And associates that don’t meet that target have the opportunity to make up the hours by year end.

In addition, we are pleased to announce that we will be awarding summer bonuses this year for all associates in the U.S. who are on pace to meet the normal quality and productivity expectations of the firm, inclusive of pro bono under our policy. Bonuses will be paid at the end of July based on annualized hours from November 1 through June 30, and we will commit to revisit anyone who did not receive a bonus at year-end if they ultimately achieve the hours goals for the associate compensation year.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# The First Biglaw Firm To Announce A COVID-19 Vaccination Plan
## Only lawyers and staff who have been vaccinated will be allowed to enter the office.

As the coronavirus crisis rages on across America, with deaths having reached 427,626 as of the time of this writing, Biglaw firms seem to be employing a [wait-and-see strategy](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/will-biglaw-firms-require-lawyers-and-staff-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine/) when it comes to the vaccination of their workforces. According to CDC guidance, lawyers and legal professionals will be in the next vaccine distribution group, so law firms are quickly losing time to make decisions on their vaccine policies.

Will Biglaw firms require their lawyers and staff to receive the COVID-19 vaccine? In a [brief survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/will-biglaw-firms-require-lawyers-and-staff-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine/) conducted by Above the Law, 49% of respondents said they thought their firms should require vaccination, while 41% said their firms should encourage vaccination, but not require it.

One Biglaw firm has decided to come out as the first to make this important decision for its employees. Will other law firms follow the lead?

Davis Wright Tremaine has announced that once its employees are eligible to get vaccinated, they will be encouraged to do so soon as possible. Thereafter, only those who have been vaccinated will be allowed to enter the office or to attend firm-sponsored events. In the future, the firm will require proof of vaccination. Lawyers and staff members who are unable to be vaccinated due to a disability, advice of a medical provider, or religious beliefs will be able to explore reasonable accommodations with the firm.

“DWT continues to place the health and safety of all of our lawyers and staff as our highest priority. As vaccines against COVID-19 become increasingly available, we are adopting a policy to safeguard the health of our employees and their families, our clients and visitors, and our communities,” said Jeff Gray, DWT’s managing partner. “We believe it is our responsibility to do our part, and we need everyone’s help to be able to get back to more normalized operations as quickly as we can.”

Not only will Davis Wright Tremaine provide paid time off for its employees to receive the vaccine and recover from side effects, if needed, but the firm will also reimburse employees for the cost of the vaccine in the event the government or insurance does not cover it. If the firm is able to do so, in-office COVID vaccinations for lawyers and staff will be offered, just like prior flu shot vaccination clinics that the firm offered.

DWT has asked that all of its employees continue to work from home until vaccines are widely available and significant portions of the population have become vaccinated, unless office work is absolutely necessary. If a lawyer or staff member must come to the office, all firm health and safety guidance must be observed (i.e., mask wearing and social distancing), even if that employee has been vaccinated.

Now that one Biglaw firm has offered reasonable guidance for COVID-19 vaccinations, it’s highly likely that others will announce their own plans — plans that will no doubt echo the one that Davis Wright Tremaine has already rolled out.

Which firm will be next to issue its vaccination policies? The Biglaw world is impatiently watching and waiting.

Are you looking to build the business case for AI at your law firm?

To build the case for acquiring and incorporating AI-based tools into your firm’s processes, you must first understand the benefits and challenges of these tools.

Artificial intelligence tools — like ChatGPT — can help law firms automate routine tasks, enhance research and analysis, improve quality and consistency, and generate new insights and solutions.

However, they also require investment in training, infrastructure, security, and ethics.

This white paper will explore:

- The problems law firms may currently be facing
- Potential solutions to solve common problems
- Risks of implementing AI – and how to avoid them
- The ROI of being an early adopter
- How you can make implementation successful
If you want to gain a competitive edge, increase your efficiency and productivity, and avoid the pitfalls of AI adoption at your law firm, you’re in the right place.

One reader (a relative newbie practicing only since 2007) and a refugee from Biglaw, finds that she’s now wrestling with how best to delegate work to attorneys newer than her without being seen as a helicopter supervisor, or being viewed as condescending or overbearing (choose your adjective), while stifling her own internal control freak.

If she’s wondering about those issues, what must the dinosaur lawyers be thinking, as they figure out what they need to do in terms of succession planning and delegating work to those who will, if necessary, kick the dinosaur bodies aside after they die at their desks? (Not a pretty image, but you get the point.)

Delegating any work confronts the fear of letting go, the fear of being fungible, which we all are (remember the bucket test?), but if any law practice, whatever its form, is to keep going, then the dinosaur lawyers and/or those who have supervisory responsibilities need to figure out how to delegate.

Harvey Mackay[ discussed principles of effective delegation](http://www.inc.com/harvey-Mackay/6-keys-effective-delegation.html) in an issue of Inc. Magazine some years back. They’re just as true today and they’ll still be true when we dinosaurs are long gone. 

Mackay lists six elements to effective delegation and they apply to every business…..even the law biz. Delegation requires both IQ and EQ (emotional intelligence for those who are unfamiliar with the concept.)

His list:

1. “Don’t look for perfection.” Amen to that. You don’t need a Cadillac when a Chevy will do. Not everything needs to be absolutely perfect, especially if the client is not expecting it and will not pay for it. Endless drafts of pleadings, documents, discovery motions and the like are tasks that run up the bills and how much value added is there really? “Good enough” is very often “good enough.” If it suffices for the client, then the work is good enough.

2. “Provide complete instructions.” This should be a no-brainer, but it’s not. I’m sure we all have unpleasant memories of files being dumped on our desks with a terse “Take care of this.” What does that mean? You open the file and there’s no clue to what’s to be done, in fact, there are no notes in the file and the file is a mess.

Your crystal ball is in the shop, and so you chase down whoever gave you the file (I’m trying to be polite here and not repeat the word “dumped”), and ask for instructions. Oftentimes, the response is a scowl and a terse “You figure it out.” Thank you for sharing. It’s the client who is going to get billed for the time while you figure out what’s what, unless the delegating attorney is smart enough to realize that the time you’ve spent chasing your tail has to be written off.

I’ve never understood why it’s so hard to give complete instructions. Does this really need to be a guessing game? No one, especially support staff, should have to guess at what’s wanted. How long does it take to give complete instructions? A lot less time than having to redo the work.

3. “Stop believing you’re the only one who can do the job properly.” (See bucket test.) Other lawyers may approach the task differently, may have a different way to proceed, but if you reach the desired result, does it matter how you got there? So many lawyers think that it’s “my way or the highway.” Good for them, but when they’re overtaken on their highway by younger lawyers who have found a better, faster, more efficient way, millennials smirk while dinosaurs eat their dust.

4. “Focus on teaching skills.” Part of teaching skills is letting people [make mistakes](https://leadershipfreak.wordpress.com/2011/10/13/how-blowing-up-a-factory-changed-jack-welch). There are very few mistakes, even in law practice, that can’t be corrected.

People will tell you that they have learned more from their mistakes than from their successes. Believe them. They’re not telling you that just to make you feel better when you’ve forgotten an exhibit to a pleading, miscalendared a date for responding to discovery, or whatever the sin of omission or commission might be. We’re human, and if there’s any question about that, see Mackay’s first point above.

5. “Check on progress.” On the one hand, you don’t want to be a helicopter supervisor (kissing cousin to a helicopter parent), but, on the other hand, you can’t abdicate your responsibility to make sure that the work is done correctly and timely. So, finding the balance between the two is tricky but necessary. Nobody likes a hoverer. Mackay says to set your expectations at the outset and have milestones to make sure that the work is coming along as anticipated.

One problem that younger lawyers have is the sense that they’ve got to do it all on their own, that to ask for help is an admission that they don’t know everything (perish the thought). The reluctance to ask for help, be it a question to be answered, a form to be used, a sample pleading to be used as a framework, can lead to procrastination and the failure to get the work done. That’s why milestones and dates for finishing various aspects of the work are critical.

6. Most importantly, Mackay says to “thank the people who have accepted the responsibility.” As the delegatee, there can be a mixture of terror and pride in getting an assignment: terror (uh-oh, what if I screw up?) and pride (they trust me to do this work-yes!). We don’t say thank you often enough. (A civility issue?) The assignment is a proving ground for the junior lawyer, but it’s still nice to acknowledge the contribution. Thank them at the start, as well as during the assignment, and upon completion. (Too touchy-feely for you? Tough.)

Nothing is more gratifying than to know that you, as a junior member of the team, have value. Nothing is harder than for us dinosaur control freaks to admit that.

Jill Switzer is closing in on 40 (not a typo) years as a active member of the State Bar of California. Yes, folks, California, that state west of the Sierra Nevada, which everyone likes to diss. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see old lawyers, young lawyers, and those in-between interact — it’s not always pretty.

On-campus interviewing season is wrapping up at highly ranked law schools across the country, and many law students have already received callback invitations for summer associate recruitment. Some law students have even received offers already. Others haven’t been so lucky, and have been plagued by rejection letters.

Some rejection letters sting a little more than others. Take, for example, this “heartfelt” letter that a student at a top 50 law school recently received:

Hello [Name]

We appreciate your interest in the Palo Alto office of Baker Botts.

As I am sure you understand, we receive applications from many very promising candidates for a limited number of open positions. We often face difficult decisions because we are unable to offer all of the well-qualified applicants a position with our firm. The decision in your case was very difficult. Reluctantly, we are unable to invite you in for interviews at this time.

Please accept our sincere wishes for your continued success.

“So that’s the famous ‘Texas-hospitality culture’ my interviewer kept gushing about,” says our tipster, who’s already accepted an offer from another firm.

Baker Botts: a firm where no one knows your name — or how to use mail merge.

Have a [rejection letter](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/rejection-letters/) you’d like to share with us? Send it our way [via email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Rejection%20Letter) (subject line: “Rejection Letter”). Feel free to redact your identifying information or mention in your transmittal message that you’d like us to redact.

We may receive more submissions than we’ll have the ability to use. But don’t worry — if we don’t print yours, we promise not to send you a rejection letter.

Abracadabra! Money will soon be magically deposited into associates’ accounts at this Magic Circle firm.

Yesterday, Linklaters became the first UK-based firm to join in on year-end and special bonuses for associates in its U.S. offices. It’s a magical time to be a lawyer.

Here’s what the 2021 bonus scale looks like at Linklaters, in case you’ve forgotten:

Associates will receive these bonus payments alongside the December 30 payout of the second half of the special bonus announced back in April. Linklaters lawyers will certainly have lots to celebrate as the year draws to a close.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

P.S. Now that one Magic Circle firm has entered the bonus fray, when will others — like Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, and Freshfields (which is trying to make its “Magic Circle” designation [magically disappear](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/freshfields-wants-to-make-its-magic-circle-designation-magically-disappear/)) — opt to join in all the fun? We imagine it will be quite soon, so get ready, associates.

# April Brings $115K Bonus Showers For Federal Clerks
## Which firm is making it rain?

Bonus bucks are budding for federal clerks.

Back in January and February, we reported that the clerkship bonus market was heating up. Quinn Emanuel raised the stakes by offering a [signing bonus of $105,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/which-biglaw-firm-is-now-offering-105k-clerkship-bonuses/) for federal clerks who joined the firm post-clerkship. Hueston Hennigan quickly followed in Quinn’s footsteps, also offering up [$105,000 signing bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/another-firm-is-ponying-up-105k-in-clerkship-bonuses/) for federal clerks who joined the firm post-clerkship. We thought this might be the beginning of a trend for law firms that wanted to compete to recruit the very best of the talent pool, but things got awfully quiet as far as additional money for clerks was concerned.

Winter’s cold on compensation for clerks has finally passed, and firms may be warming up to the idea of awarding them with bountiful bonus bucks. April seems to be bringing showers of cash for former clerks, and the first firm to step up to the plate appears to blow Quinn Emanuel’s signing bonus out of the water at first glance — but only when it comes to clerkship work completed at a specific federal court.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In a brief press release published on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6386619132766351360), Fish & Richardson boasts that it’s “hik[ing] Federal Circuit clerk bonuses by nearly 30 percent.” Check it out:

Beginning in April 2018, Fish will offer $115,000 bonuses to clerks who have completed two years at the Federal Circuit (or a combination of one year at the Federal Circuit and one year at a federal district court). Clerks with 18 months at the Federal Circuit will receive a $105,000 bonus, and those with one year will receive a $100,000 bonus. Clerks from federal district courts will receive $50,000 bonuses.

Of course this IP-centric firm is willing to pay robust bonuses to Federal Circuit clerks, as the Federal Circuit is the only appellate court with jurisdiction over patent cases.

However, that gleaming $115,000 is for two years of service at the Federal Circuit (or one year coupled another year at a federal district court). A year and a half of clerking at the Federal Circuit will get a clerk the same $105,000 they’d get at Quinn or Hueston for just one year of clerking. Clerks who spent one year at the Federal Circuit will get $5,000 less than what they’d get at Quinn or Hueston, and clerks who worked only at the federal district court level will receive $55,000 less than what they’d get at Quinn or Hueston. Fish & Richardson cares the most about the Federal Circuit, and when the cash is crunched like this, it really shows.

Nevertheless, congratulations to all Federal Circuit clerks who go on to find a home at Fish. All of that extra cash will make your days spent clerking even more worthwhile.

If you have information about any firm’s clerkship bonuses, you should [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Clerkship%20Bonuses) or text us (646-820-8477) with all the details.

It’s that time again. The time when we look back at the previous year in the Canadian capital markets to determine who provided counsel on the juiciest Canadian debt and equity raises. Thanks to our friends at the Legal Post who [compile this terrific data every year](http://www.financialpost.com/m/wp/legal-post/blog.html?b=business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/dealmakers-2016-click-here-for-all-our-data&pubdate=2016-01-31).

As always, we’re interested not only in the overall market, but also how the incumbent Seven Sisters fared against the carpet-bagging Internationals.

Without further ado…

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The Legal Post reports that Canadian firms in 2015 provided counsel to 385 Issuer deals for a total value of $133.6 billion. Comparing that to 2014, there were a lot more deals in 2014 (488), but the total value of deals was slightly less ($130.1 billion). Thus, it appears Canadian firms were less busy, but worked on a higher dollar value per deal, viz., in 2015, the average deal was $34.7 million. In 2014, the average deal was just $26.7 million.

Here are some superlatives:

2015 Top Counsel to Issuers (by total deal value):  Norton Rose, who advised issuers on a total of $30.7 billion worth of deals.

2015 Top Counsel to Underwriters (by total deal value): McCarthys, who advised underwriters on a total of $19.7 billion worth of deals.

2015 Top Counsel to Issuers (by number of deals): It’s a tie! Osler and Blakes each advised on 42 deals.

2015 Top Counsel to Underwriters (by number of deals): Stikeman, who advised on 63 deals.

2015 Top Non-Bay Street Firm: Props to Calgary firm Burnet, Duckworth who pulled in a total of 25 deals (both issuer and underwriter) without a Bay Street presence. Well done.

2015’s Biggest Equity Deal: Blakes represented the issuer and Osler represented the underwriter for Element Financial Corp.’s $2.8 billion equity raise.

2015’s Biggest Debt Deal: McCarthys represented TD Bank for a $2.7 billion debt raise. Simpson Thatcher also assisted on the issuer side. Morrison & Foerster represented the underwriter.

Now let’s take a look at the Seven Sisters vs. The Internationals. This year we’re going to include Gowlings, who will soon finalize its merger with international firm, Wragge Lawrence.

2015 Issuers’ Counsel (Seven Sisters vs. Internationals)

Total Deal Value (millions)	Rank by Deal Value	Total Number of Deals	Rank by Number of Deals
Norton Rose	30,678.23	1	37	4
Osler	25,619.54	2	42	1
McCarthys	19,344.73	3	38	3
Blakes	15,882.74	4	42	1
Torys	11,662.37	5	34	5
Stikeman	8,268.70	6	29	6
Davies	2,437.55	10	6	15
Goodmans	1,746.97	13	13	9
Dentons	1,113.41	15	6	15
Gowlings	95.2	22	3	19
Baker & McKenzie	8	32	1	30
DLA Piper	3.5	35	2	21
Thoughts: As mentioned above, Norton Rose has worked its way to the top of this table. In 2014 (see below), Norton Rose was second in this category.  As you’ll notice, it goes Norton Rose, followed by all seven of the Seven Sisters, then the remaining Internationals. Thus, although Norton Rose has done really well here, the remaining Internationals still have a long way to go to catch the incumbent Seven Sisters (like from here to Mars).

2015 Underwriters’ Counsel (Seven Sisters vs. Internationals)

Total Deal Value (millions)	Rank by Deal Value	Total Number of Deals	Rank by Number of Deals
McCarthys	19,679.89	1	49	2
Stikeman	16,052.84	2	63	1
Osler	13,424.43	3	27	4
Blakes	10,501.15	4	44	3
Norton Rose	7,877.27	5	15	7
Torys	7,482.01	6	22	5
Goodmans	4,259.26	7	11	9
Dentons	2,746.77	9	8	12
Davies	1,129.65	12	8	12
Baker & McKenzie	83.14	19	3	19
Gowlings	71	20	4	17
DLA Piper	2.04	28	4	17
Thoughts: McCarthys is the king of this table for the second year in a row. Not surprisingly, the Seven Sisters dominated this category. I am surprised to see DLA Piper did way worse in 2015 than it did in 2014 as Davis LLP. At least in 2014, Davis LLP had an okay showing with 12 total deals. In 2015, with the supposed benefit of the DLA brand, DLA/Davis advised on only 6 deals for an aggregate of $5.54 million. I don’t think DLA will be tweeting those stats with pride.

Now, I don’t know what DLA’s Canadian strategy is, but I have to think getting a piece of the lucrative capital markets work is part of that plan. They have a long, long way to go (like from here to Uranus) to reach a competitive spot in this high-value, high-prestige practice area. Put differently, I doubt Norton Rose lawyers are waking in a sweat worrying about DLA pilfering their clients.

With respect to the Seven Sisters, we might have to recategorize Davies Ward as a Seven Step-Sister. For a firm that some think is the best business firm in Canada, it’s definitely bringing up the rear for the Seven Sisters. In 2014, it did 19 deals (issuer and underwriter). In 2015, it did only 14 deals. Goodmans had the next fewest for the Sisters with 24 deals.

Maybe Davies lawyers just have to work harder? I joke, it’s a play on the “Slavies” thing.

Here are the 2014 tables for your review and comparison. Please feel free to parse the data in any way that makes you happy.

2014 Issuers’ Counsel (Seven Sisters vs. Internationals)

Total Deal Value (millions)	Rank by Deal Value	Total Number of Deals	Rank by Number of Deals
McCarthys	22,496.09	1	42	3
Norton Rose	18,829.25	2	31	5

Davies	5,650.46	7	11	13
Goodmans	3,890.80	9	21	8

# Biglaw Modernization Leads To Layoffs
## Is 'care' the same as 'generous severance package'?

It’s getting to be a familiar tale: law firms couching [staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/staff-layoffs/) in terms of moving forward or in this specific case, “implementing our strategic plan, which focuses on proactively modernizing the way we run our firm.” Today, we’ve learned [Stoel Rives](https://www.stoel.com/) is laying off 17 staff members across its offices.

Though in a firm wide email, managing partner James Torgerson notes the layoffs only account for 2.1 percent of the firm’s workforce, that seems like cold comfort for those who find themselves without a job. But hey, the firm assures everyone the decision was made with “care.” Let’s hope Stoel defines “care” as “generous severance package.”

Also of note, Torgerson announced an outsourcing agreement with legal support vendor [DTI](https://www.dtiglobal.com/), which will take over the reception, IT help desk, catering, and records departments:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In addition, we have concluded that fully outsourcing certain services is necessary as part of our practice modernization process. As a result, we are partnering with DTI, a company we believe can provide us with modern business methods, training programs, best practices, and cost efficiencies. DTI is one of the most experienced legal process outsourcing service providers. It has more than 100 local offices in over 50 regions and 7,000 employees globally. DTI currently supports 27% of AmLaw 150 firms and 50% of the ten largest law firms in the country with onsite management services.

Over the next several months, DTI will take over the business services role that RICOH has been performing, and also will staff Reception, IT Concierge, Catering, and Records. The affected departments will work closely with DTI during the transition.

Here’s hoping all those laid off find new positions quickly.

You can read the full email from the managing partner on the next page.

# Biglaw Firm Scraps Their Old Performance Reviews
## HoLove says the old system was 'broken.'

Is there anything more frustratingly useless as performance reviews? If anyone you actually work with remembers to take the time away from their own billable hours, it’s almost inevitably from a minor assignment you completed in three hours nine months ago that you can only barely recall.

Hogan Lovells recognized the system was “broken” — hell, they never even went back to the performance reviews when partnership or other big employment decisions came up  — and so they’re doing away withe the antiquated system. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/04/12/hogan-lovells-scraps-broken-review-system-for-associates/) Law.com:

“When it came time to make important decisions—who should be advanced, who should become a partner—we never went back and read the reports because they were in a sense detached from the process of managing development,” said Steve Immelt, Hogan Lovells’ Washington, D.C.-based CEO. “We thought the system we had was broken in a number of respects and not really delivering what our people needed and wanted.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In place of the old system, HoLove has rolled out a Pathways program, which gives associates “flash feedback.” The program has associates receiving three pieces of feedback from co-workers every four months. Even though the new system is designed to be more responsive to the needs of associates, Immelt is aware it may take some time before everyone is on board:

“Even saying that the old system was broken didn’t mean that this was the right solution,” he said. “This does change the approach, and we all know how lawyers don’t like things to change, so we wanted to be sure this was going to be an approach people would adapt and pick up.”

This feedback system is not designed to inform questions of compensation, but it meant to develop associates and help them figure out where they fit into life at the firm.

“You find in the law firm setting that people have very high expectations, very demanding, but there’s not only a reluctance at times to give constructive feedback but also a reluctance to give positive feedback,” Immelt said. “So by trying to change that rhythm … it’s just another way we as a firm are trying to adapt to a modern workplace with a modern group of associates who have different expectations than I had many years ago when I was a young associate.”

# Biglaw Firm Ditches Partner Nabbed In College Admissions Scandal
## Plus it looks like jail time is on the horizon.

Gordan Caplan

The consequences just keep piling on Gordon Caplan, the co-chair of Willkie Farr[ caught in the college admissions scandal dubbed “Operation Varsity Blues” by authorities](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/willkie-farr-chair-caught-in-college-admissions-scandal/). Strike that, make it former co-chair of Willkie Farr. Caplan was already suspended from the firm when it was announced he’d [plead guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/suspended-co-chair-of-biglaw-firm-charged-in-college-admissions-scandal-will-plead-guilty/?rf=1) to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. On Friday, [the firm announced](https://www.law.com/2019/04/05/ex-willkie-co-chair-gordon-caplan-to-plead-guilty-in-college-cheating-case/) Caplan “is no longer a partner of Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP.” And they minced few words, blaming it entirely on his illegal effort to get his daughter into an elite college:

“Mr. Caplan’s departure is a result of his involvement in the college admissions matter and his recent statement regarding his intent to plead to a criminal charge,” the firm said. “At Willkie, nothing is more important to us than our integrity and we do not tolerate behavior that runs contrary to our core values. We remain focused on our responsibilities to our clients, partners and employees.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As you’ll recall, Caplan was accused of paying $75,000 to college coaches turned government cooperating witnesses for a scheme to have a professional alter his daughter’s answers on the ACT in order to get her a higher score.

Caplan’s plea deal with prosecutors was [released online](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/page/file/1152636/download) yesterday. The agreement states the agreed upon offense level is 11, which means for someone with no criminal history, a recommended term of 8 to 14 months in prison. As [Law.com reports](https://www.law.com/2019/04/08/caplan-to-plead-guilty-along-with-13-others-in-admissions-scandal-probe/), the court will ultimately do its own assessment of any potential jail time:

The government agreed to recommend a term at the lower end of that range, but the court will also do its own calculation and consider other factors in the ultimate sentencing calculation. Prosecutors also agreed to recommend a year of supervised release and a $40,000 fine. Caplan also waved his right to appeal the court’s decision.

Caplan is one of 13 parents who agreed to plea deals as part of Operation Varsity Blues. A court date for the guilty pleas has not yet been set.

# Associate Bonus Watch: It Ain't Over Til It's Over
## Associates at this firm did well for themselves.

Spring is here, and associates at one firm are seeing green — the greenbacks of bonus money, that is. And they are pleased.

Here is one representative tipster, reporting on the bonus news delivered last week at [McDermott Will & Emery](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/mcdermott-will-emery/):

Midlevel associate with high hours. Nearly double Cravath. I’m very happy, and everyone I’ve spoken with is very happy.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
This associate is not an outlier in getting an above-market bonus. From the memo (posted in full on the next page):

Late last week we announced Associate bonuses in all of our U.S. offices. We are pleased that a substantial number of our U.S. Associates have been awarded bonuses that exceed the Cravath scale. In fact, this year 50% of our U.S. Associates will receive bonuses in excess of the Cravath scale including Associates in each class year. The top bonuses in five Associate classes exceed the Cravath scale by at least $60,000.

Very nice. The nature of an individualized bonus system like MWE’s means that there will be some variation, but we have not heard any complaints (and we usually do when a firm doesn’t do right by its associates).

March might feel late for bonus news, but it’s consistent with past practice at McDermott. Last year, for example, the firm also [announced in March](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/associate-bonus-watch-more-money-at-mcdermott/).

In high school I was known as … Quarterback of the football team. Just kidding. A nerd, obviously.

— [Kannon Shanmugam](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/kannon-k-shanmugam), chair of the Supreme Court and appellate practice group at Paul Weiss, in response to one of [10 personal questions from Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/taylor-swift-bbq-wordle-10-questions-paul-weiss-kannon-shanmugam-2022-02-10/). Shanmugam is also a huge Taylor Swift fan (her music is his “guilty pleasure”), a math wizard (he was the “eight-time Kansas state math champion,” and yet he still “miscalculat[es] due dates for briefs”), and says he would’ve been a sportswriter if he weren’t a lawyer.

# Some Good Bonus News... But Are Associates Here Still Making $180K?!?

Morgan Lewis didn’t want its associates going home for the weekend (oh, who are we kidding, “coming into the office this weekend”) not knowing where they stand bonus-wise. So that’s why they announced a full Cravath match for associates meeting the 1900-hour threshold.

That’s the good news. There’s no memo — Morgan Lewis gives out bonus news over voicemail — but as a reminder, that means folks are getting paid:

2018 $15K prorated
2017 $15K
2016 $25K
2015 $50K
2014 $65K
2013 $80K
2012 $90K
2011 and earlier $100K

Now the bad news is… there are apparently still some associates making $180K here.

Yes, even after the summer of raises, some associates still aren’t feeling the love. We wrote about [this phenomenon here](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/for-this-biglaw-firm-first-comes-raises-then-comes-the-fine-print/), but basically, the firm told associates that their raises were contingent upon a nebulous formula that isn’t necessarily tied to an objective billables target. One would have assumed the firm had cleared this all up by now, but tipsters tell us there are still associates at the lower pay scale and are even unlikely to get bumped up to $200K when January rolls around.

Does this mean there are class of 2018 pups roaming the halls making more money than associates who’ve been there a year already? According to our sources, yes!

That’s ludicrous. At least there’s a nice bonus to help salve that wound.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Assuming anyone in this salary group is even eligible for the bonus….

UPDATE: Morgan Lewis tells me that there’s more to this than meets the eye. According to the firm, this policy for associates who don’t meet the firm’s performance standards is a long-standing policy designed specifically to avoid the less desirable outcome of terminating associates.

Where many firms might push — gently or more firmly — an associate out after an unsatisfactory review, Morgan Lewis gives associates a six month, at least, opportunity to get back on track during which time the associate does not receive a raise or a bonus.

Why would a firm consider a policy like this? Quite frankly, because they trust their own instincts. If they hired an associate in the first place, they saw a young lawyer they wanted to work with and they want an opportunity to get the person up to speed.

It may be a bit unconventional to not have offered the summer cost of living adjustment — after all, the goal of the policy is to functionally hold associates back from advancing with their class, and the across the board raises weren’t about advancement but changing everyone’s base — but that’s why the firm has this curious situation with a handful of first years making less than the going first year salary.

# Lawyers Tell Clients They Understand, But Do They Really?
## Supporting people during challenging times is an art, and it goes beyond having mere legal expertise.

Whether you work as an in-house lawyer for a company or in private practice for a law firm, navigating the tumultuous waters of client distress is all part of the job. Recently, I spoke at length with my daughter, also a lawyer, about her perspective on supporting clients during difficult times. Our conversation left a lasting impression on me. With close to 20 years of experience, I’ve worked with a number of clients who have found themselves in extremely stressful situations. Each of those clients had been dealing with their own unique set of challenges with all of the emotions that come with those challenges. Each and every time, I have found myself uttering the words “I understand” at one point or another. Each and every time, I have found that uttering those words was the exact WRONG thing to do. By uttering those words, I may not have just come off as cold and insincere, I may have also inadvertently exacerbated my clients’ distress.

The truth is, as lawyers, we often find ourselves unable to fully grasp the depth of our clients’ experiences because we haven’t walked in their shoes. Clients don’t seek our sympathy or pity; rather, they yearn for practical solutions, even though they understand that we can’t magically make their problems disappear. In these moments, the most valuable form of support we can offer is often a listening ear coupled with a genuine expression of care and concern.

So, what should our response be when faced with a client in distress? My insightful daughter offered a more empathetic approach that resonated deeply with me: “What you’re going through is horrible. How can I support you through this?” This approach embodies empathy and acknowledges the gravity of the client’s situation without attempting to trivialize or downplay their emotions. By asking how we can support them, we demonstrate a sincere willingness to stand by our clients and assist them in navigating their challenges.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Implementing this approach into my practice is something I’m genuinely looking forward to doing. It aligns with my personal values and professional ethos, while emphasizing the importance of human connection and understanding in the legal profession. By embracing empathy and actively seeking to support our clients in their times of need, we not only strengthen our professional relationships but it also upholds the core principles of justice and compassion.

Adopting this empathetic approach can have tangible benefits for clients and lawyers alike. For clients, knowing that their lawyer genuinely cares about their well-being can provide much-needed reassurance and comfort during difficult times. This, in turn, can foster trust and confidence in the legal process, ultimately leading to more positive outcomes for all parties involved.

Conversely, cultivating empathy in our interactions with clients can lead to a more fulfilling and rewarding practice for us as lawyers. By connecting with our clients on a deeper level and understanding their perspectives, we can better tailor our approach to meet their individual needs and concerns. This not only enhances client satisfaction but also contributes to our own professional growth and development as lawyers.

The take away for me from this conversation? Supporting people during challenging times is an art, and it goes beyond having mere legal expertise; it requires empathy, compassion, and a genuine desire to help. By adopting a more empathetic approach in our interactions with our clients, we can not only provide better support but also strengthen the foundation of trust and understanding upon which the legal profession is built. So let’s strive to be more than just lawyers — let’s be compassionate allies to our clients in their times of need.

# Massive Law Firm To Become Even More Massiver
## Dentons grows... again.

We’ve run out of ways to express the rise of Dentons with proper English. It’s hard to believe this is a firm that didn’t even exist 7 years ago when SNR Denton, Fraser Milner Casgrain and Salans got together to create what at the time was a pretty big firm — roughly 2500 lawyers. That figure seems quaint now. After merging with Dacheng to create a “[gobsmacking](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/gobsmacked-by-dacheng-dentons/)” 6600 attorney firm, the firm didn’t stop.

Today, the firm has over 10,000 attorneys working around the world and while you’d think that would be more than enough to cover every conceivable market and practice area, but you would apparently be wrong.

Yesterday, Dentons announced that it plans to merge with Lee International, a leading law firm in South Korea. In keeping with the verein model Dentons operates under, the South Korea practice would be owned and controlled by the South Korean partners — making it the first global firm where local operations are 100% owned and controlled by Korean partners.
“With this combination, Dentons will be the only global law firm permitted to practice Korean law, offering clients high-quality legal counsel and business solutions,” said Joe Andrew, Global Chairman of Dentons. “This combination is an illustration of Dentons’ strategy to scale the business in dynamic and growing regions.”

Lee International is not bringing a Dacheng-level influx of new lawyers to the Dentons umbrella, but it does add a hefty number of both attorneys and dedicated patent attorneys. Lee International is a full-service firm boasting a strong reputation in IP, M&A, Finance, Real Estate, Corporate, Litigation, Entertainment, L&E, TMT, and Biotech. “We are enthusiastic about joining Dentons.” said Sung-Duck Park, Representative Attorney of Lee International. “The combination with Dentons will enable us to connect our respective talents to opportunities in South Korea and around the world.”

The merger is still pending partner approval and regulatory clearance but will probably be finalized over the next several months.

# Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries Because They Know It's The Only Way To Keep Good Associates
## It's all about the talent pool.

Here’s what we know: the associate [lateral market is fire](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/), Biglaw is already trying [special bonuses to keep the associates they have](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/special-bonuses-are-just-another-way-to-keep-associates-hooked-on-biglaw/?rf=1) while simultaneously enticing new ones, and elite Biglaw firms are also[ raising salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/cravath-raises/) for associates. Given these facts, it only makes sense that raises will ripple through Biglaw as part of a battle for legal talent.

This is all something leadership at Sheppard Mullin knows. It was even explicitly acknowledged in the firm’s memo announcing associate raises: “Remaining competitive in attracting and retaining talented Associates is a critical part of [providing value and service to our clients] endeavor.” So, effective July 1, the below scale is what associates there will be making.

# Season Of Associate Raises Is Not Over Yet
## Today, the expected announcement came.

As we inch ever closer to July 1, the date when most of the announced Biglaw raises become effective, associates at firms that haven’t announced raises yet are getting increasingly anxious. That’s been [especially true at King & Spalding](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/by-any-metric-these-firms-really-should-have-raised-associate-compensation-by-now/) — a firm with a staggering $1,138,540,000 in revenue, placing it 21st in profitability and 22nd in profits per partner.

Earlier this week, an email from a fellow associate that supposedly had inside knowledge made the rounds assuring everyone “all offices will have salary increases; amount of increase will be individualized by office.” I’m sure that was certainly nice to hear, but until the powers that be made an official announcement saying they’d decided to move salaries in accordance with the new market reality, the rank-and-file associate was on pins and needles.

Today, that announcement came.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Associates have received individualized memos, and the offices that had been on the New York scale appear to have moved to the full [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale. Atlanta associates — [who didn’t move up to the $180K scale in 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/firm-with-big-profits-per-partner-shares-the-riches-in-new-york/) — got raises too, just not quite as large.

Special bonuses will also be paid to associates on track to meet the hours requirement. If an associate does not meet that billing mark mid-year, they’ll have an opportunity to earn that special bonus at year end.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the globe has impacted virtually every facet of life. We’re living in unprecedented times. Nothing is normal anymore. We’re living through the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.

Major law firms immediately reacted to this unwelcome news by attempting to manage their expenses through salary cuts, benefits reductions, furloughs, and layoffs. It appears that some firms, however, were overly cautious in the face of all the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, and now they’ve decided to either partially or completely walk back their austerity measures.

Just as we’ve done in the past when it comes to raises and bonuses, we are compiling a table of all the firms that have announced reductions to their cost-cutting measures in these strange times. Today, we unveil that table so you can see exactly how Biglaw firms are revising their financial remedies, restoring salaries, and offering bonuses amid the coronavirus crisis. We will be updating this table as needed as more news is announced. If you see any information here that is incorrect, [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Salary%20Cut%20Rollback%20Tracker).

# Biglaw Firm Raises Associate Salaries, Offers Market-Busting Bonuses For Big Billers
## Wow! This Biglaw firm is offering associates bonuses of up to $45K over market.

Biglaw firms continue to earnestly reward their associates with salary increases and bonuses on the Cravath scale. For some firms, though, these market bonuses are just the base line — as it turns out, there’s a great deal of extra bonus money to be had. Just how much extra bonus money are we talking?

With a maximum bonus potential for senior associates of $160,000, Schulte Roth & Zabel is in it to win it this bonus season. The firm — which brought in $509,400,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 94 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — announced raises and bonuses yesterday afternoon, and as far as bonuses are concerned, SRZ is offering much more than a simple Cravath match.

Here’s what the bonus scale looks like at SRZ, with lots of extra cash for the highest of billers, to be paid on January 22, 2024:



As you can see, there are three levels of step-up bonuses, and each requires a higher level of billable hours (i.e., “extraordinary contributions to the firm”): 2300, 2500, and 2700 hours, respectively. These above-market bonuses are quite the “thank you” for the dedicated work associates have been putting in this year.

The firm is also offering partial credit bonuses for those who were unable to meet their minimum hours target. As noted in the memo, associates with 1600 hours will receive a 50% class bonus, while associates with fewer than 1600 hours will receive a $5,000 bonus.

On top of these bonuses, Schulte has chosen to use the Cravath scale for its compensation increases, meaning these are the salaries associates at the firm will see, effective January 1, 2024:

- Class of 2023 – $225,000
- Class of 2022 – $235,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000
- Class of 2020 – $310,000
- Class of 2019 – $365,000
- Class of 2018 – $390,000
- Class of 2017 – $420,000
- Class of 2016 – $435,000
- Class of 2015 – $445,000
(We’ll note here that Schulte is only the third firm to offer ninth-years in the class of 2015 a salary of $445K, following in the footsteps of Sidley and Ropes. Will any other firm be willing to match the $130K bonus that Ropes has offered to its most senior associates?)

Congratulations to everyone at SRZ!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from the firm.)

# Biglaw Deferrals May Just Be Getting Started
## This is a very concerning trend for incoming associates.

In case you haven’t been paying attention, deferrals seem to be en vogue in Biglaw right now.

How did this blast from the recession past arrive here in 2023? Here’s a quick reminder. Back in April, following a [round of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/), Cooley kicked off the most recent race to shrink incoming associate classes by [deferring its first-years](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/after-layoffs-last-year-cooley-delays-start-date-for-first-year-associates/) to January 2024. Gunderson soon followed with its [second round](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-firm-lays-off-10-of-its-workforce-may-defer-incoming-associates/) of deferrals, again to January 2024. Then, Fenwick [jumped on the bandwagon](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/fenwick-deferral-associates-corporate-technology/), deferring only its incoming corporate and technology transactions first-years to January 2024. Last week, Cooley was back again, offering a [year-long deferral](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/cooley-deferral-corporate-associates/) for select incoming corporate associates, this time with a $100K stipend.

This is a bit concerning, right?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/09/associate-deferrals-reveal-concerns-of-a-sustained-downturn-especially-in-tech/) spoke to several law firm consultants and recruiters concerning the likelihood of more deferrals coming down the pipeline, and the general consensus seems to be that more may be on the way sometime soon for certain practice areas.

“Fenwick and Cooley are examples of firms that are generally respected and give cover to others to push back,” one consultant told Am Law, while others said that firms that went on hiring sprees back in 2021 — especially firms that “rely on deal activity tethered to the tech sector” — may be inclined to defer their incoming classes. Here’s more from [Am Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/09/associate-deferrals-reveal-concerns-of-a-sustained-downturn-especially-in-tech/):

Recruiters generally agreed that while unfortunate, deferrals are likely a prudent business decision and certainly, a better alternative to layoffs.

Some recruiters added that deferrals can be a useful mechanism to retain talent, by keeping incoming associates in the queue while providing a meaningful amount of work and experience to current associates.

“Deferrals allow firms to retain the top talent they’ve recruited,” [Jennifer] Henderson[, co-founder of legal search firm Hatch Henderson Fivel,] said. “And they can always bring them back sooner if demand improves.”

Henderson went on to call Cooley’s deferrals “humane” — after all, it’s of no use to have new associates start their careers in an environment where there’s not enough work to go around.

# Morning Docket: 06.07.17
## * Is there a constitutional right to follow President Donald Trump on Twitter?

Good luck! [[WSJ Law Blog](https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2017/06/06/dont-block-twitter-followers-first-amendment-activists-tell-trump/)] * Following an investigation conducted by Perkins Coie, Uber fired more than 20 employees thanks to complaints of sexual harassment, bullying, and discrimination. Perkins Coie's probe is separate from that of former Attorney General Eric Holder, who is now employed at Covington & Burling. [[ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uber-dismisses-20-employees-law-firms-probe-47871615)] * Per sources inside the Trump administration, the president is expected to nominate Cheryl Stanton, a former Ogletree Deakins partner, to head the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division. Stanton shares a former boss with Labor Secretary Alex Acosta: Justice Samuel Alito. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/ex-ogletree-lawyer-said-to-be-picked-to-run-wage-hour-division/)] * Michelle Lee, the director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, has resigned. During her time at the USPTO, Lee was known for her efforts to crack down on patent trolls, which ultimately led to a decrease in their vexatious litigation. The Trump administration has not yet put forth a nominee. [[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trademark-idUSL1N1J3237)] * The American Bar Association has granted provisional accreditation to the University of North Texas Dallas College of Law. Last summer, the ABA refused to grant even provisional accreditation to the school because there was concern about future graduates' ability to pass the bar exam. Congrats...

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to data collected by ALM for the Am Law 100 ranking, what is the average profit per lawyer (PPL) across the top 100 firms?

Hint: Profits per lawyer is represented by a firm’s net income divided by its lawyer count. PPL was down 7.1% in 2022 compared with the year prior, thanks to demand issues and increasing expenses.

# Where Wall Street Goes, Biglaw Will Follow -- Including Back To The Office
## Biglaw, big chunks of time spent at the office? It may happen sooner than you'd like.

The big banks want their people back in the office, and that means that the law firms that service them want their lawyers back, too. Say it’s for mentorship, say it’ll benefit firm culture, say whatever you want, but what it boils down to is the fact that client cash rules everything around Biglaw firms — especially if those firms are based in New York City.

Many of Manhattan’s Am Law 100 firms — firms like Cadwalader; Davis Polk; Fried Frank; Milbank; Skadden; and Shearman & Sterling — have adopted on-site work requirements for associates that run from Tuesday through Thursday. But will that change in the future, thanks to what Biglaw’s biggest financial clients do? Here’s a little clue from [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/manhattan-law-firms-eye-wall-streets-lead-on-office-returns):

“It wouldn’t shock me if law firms’ office attendance policies align more with those of their clients and in-office attendance requirements increase from where they are now,” said Neil Barr, chair and managing partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell. “But that’s more predictive for the industry than reflective of anything we’re thinking about right now.”

In the meantime, the rumors of stealth layoffs spreading throughout Biglaw may be more helpful than actual mandates when it comes to getting people to return to their firms in real life. “When associates start seeing their peers being laid off for performance reasons, they tend to double down on their work rather than look for another job,” Jennifer Coffey, a New York-based legal recruiter for Macrae, told Bloomberg.

Don’t worry, Biglaw isn’t heading to a full week in the office — at least, not yet. But when your job may depend on hours billed in the office, heading back for at least part of the week (or more) seems likes it’s going to be more and more unavoidable going forward.

# Rainmaker.AI
## Why are associates not spending time learning to develop clients at their firms, and why are most law firm partners not focused on teaching and mentoring associates to become rainmakers?

Rainmaker.AI applies sophisticated machine learning algorithms to automate the law firm business development process.  The mobile phone and PC-based App automatically handles the entire process from introductory communications, automated email interactions with prospects, learning about prospects’ businesses and personal life events, and ultimately proposing necessary legal services.  Rainmaker.AI even has built-in conflict checking functionality and an automated client engagement letter execution process.  With Rainmaker.AI, law firm attorneys now can just sit at their desk and watch Rainmaker.AI bring in the business and then press the buttons on their AI-based litigation tools and contract automation tools as needed by the newly generated clients.

The good news for associates about Rainmaker.AI is that it will not eliminate any of their hours and put their jobs at risk because most associates aren’t spending any time on business development anyway.  The better news about Rainmaker.AI for associates is that in the words of Billy Joel, “….it’s just a fantasy, it’s not the real thing.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But the fantasy of Rainmaker.AI begs the question, “Why are associates not spending time learning to develop clients at their firms, and why are most law firm partners not focused on teaching and mentoring associates to become rainmakers?”

The answer to the problem of artificial intelligence (which as we have suggested before is the law firm industry’s term of art for all legal technology) reducing law firm associate billable hours is GROWTH.  In our legal services business, we implemented legal technology year after year, reducing the amount of time associates spent on specific tasks by anywhere from 20% to 50%.  But we kept increasing headcount because we kept growing with new clients and greater quantities of work from our clients.  We put our associates on the phone and in meetings with clients from a very early stage and client relationships was a key component to their promotion in our corporate ladder.  Perhaps getting associates out of the office to participate in industry conferences, lunches, and happy hours to develop their networks would enable them not only to contribute to their firms’ growth but also secure a brighter path to partnership and ensure that they are productive, profitable partners from day one.

We have seen some bright spots.  We have seen some partners who talk with associates about networking and then finesse developing relationships before moving into comments about law firm representation.  We have seen partners who take their associates out to business development lunches and after-hours drinks to show them how it is done.  These same partners guide their associates to engage in telephone and email correspondence directly with the partner’s clients and then take them to meetings where they pitch for new work or address a problem.

But these are just bright spots; for the most part, law firm partners are keeping associates in the background assigning them work so the partners can then turn around and email the work product to the client in their own name.  Worse, even when associates have extensive client contact, they’re not trained in how to develop new business from existing clients, or how to find and land new clients.  Likewise, associates are often so focused on the billing code, and billable credit, that they miss opportunities to learn how to develop business from seasoned partners because they want to bill for that time.  Many partners would like to train associates in business development, but not if that means writing off time because the associate wants to bill that time to a client.  Having been there ourselves, we know the pressure to meet minimum billable requirements. But both of us were able to meet our billables AND bring in new clients, learning how to do that on our own time, much like salespeople don’t get quota relief during sales training days.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Ultimately, the notion that law firms can grow and even survive with these kinds of practices is as much a fantasy as Rainmaker.AI.

The reality is that the only way for law firms to successfully grow their practices profitably and sustainably over time is teach and mentor associates from day one to build their network, build personal relationships and bonds with client prospects, and ultimately how to generate business from those prospects and themselves becoming real live rainmakers.

Many observers of Biglaw, myself included, have been waiting for the inevitable downturn that will bring down the curtain on the post-recession recovery. The good news is that it hasn’t happened — yet. But it could be coming sooner than one might think.

Today the American Lawyer released its industry-defining [Am Law 100 rankings](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784597030/The-2017-Am-Law-100?mcode=1202615717726), the nation’s largest law firms ranked by revenue. The overall picture the numbers paint is not particularly dramatic, but there’s one telling statistic that could mark the beginning of the end. Here are some overall stats about how the Am Law 100 performed in 2016:

- Total revenue: $86.7 billion (a new record), up by 4.3 percent (compared to 2.7 percent last year).
- Total headcount: 95,515, up by 2.7 percent (compared to less than 1 percent last year).
- Average profits per partner: $1.66 million, up by 3 percent (compared to 4 percent last year).
- Average revenue per lawyer: $907,765, up by 1.5 percent (compared to 2.6 percent last year).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s that last figure that has some folks worried. As Roy Strom explains over at [Am Law](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784500051):

[A] slowdown in the growth of revenue per lawyer may portend trouble ahead for a growing number of firms. “RPL,” long believed to be the most reliable single indicator of a law firm’s financial health, increased a mere 1.5 percent, the second lowest increase in RPL since 2011. That broadly disappointing number, however, is driven by another ongoing story in Big Law: increasing stratification among firms.

That stratification, a growing gap between winners and losers, is also part of the not-so-new normal. Among the winners:

Consider perhaps the most interesting development in this year’s Am Law 100: Kirkland & Ellis’ 15 percent growth in revenue, to $2.65 billion, propelled the firm to the Am Law 100’s second place-ranking for the first time ever. For the erstwhile Chicago firm that now has offices spanning the globe, including an established stronghold in the wealthiest legal market, New York City, 2016 was the culmination of more than a decade of growth in both revenue and profitability. The firm joined rarefied air in growing profits per equity partner (“PPP”) above $4 million, a distinction only held by five other New York firms: Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan; Paul, Weiss, Wharton, Rifkind & Garrison; Cravath, Swaine & Moore; and Sullivan & Cromwell.

There K&E goes again, [shattering](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-kirkland-ellis-returns-to-shattering-the-bonus-market-ceiling/) the market. Am Law attributes Kirkland’s success to its thriving practices in M&A, private equity, and energy (driven in part by the firm’s relatively new Houston office, which now boasts more than 100 attorneys).

Its alphabetical neighbor, K&L Gates, also had a strong year. The firm is going through some upheaval — a [leadership transition](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/it-takes-two-to-fill-the-shoes-of-peter-kalis-at-kl-gates/), some [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/nationwide-layoff-watch-150-to-200-jobs-is-a-lot-of-jobs/), a bunch of [partner departures](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/why-are-so-many-partners-walking-out-the-kl-gates/) — but there’s no denying that it fared well financially. Revenue grew by almost 11 percent and PPP grew by 16 percent, topping $1 million (although one has to wonder how much of this was due to a [big contingency win](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/good-news-out-of-the-kl-gates/), and whether it can be repeated next year).

Now let’s take a deeper dive into major metrics: the top firms by gross revenue, revenue per lawyer, and profits per partner, on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/2/)….

In the past, people knew Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman as a firm that was full of [“superior legal minds.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/08/lawsuit-of-the-day-ex-kasowitz-associate-with-superior-legal-mind-sues-the-firm-for-77-million/) These days, people know Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman as a firm with close ties to President Donald Trump, with two name partners deeply entrenched in his regime. Name partner Marc Kasowitz essentially served as Trump’s legal heavy during the 2016 campaign, threatening to file suit against the New York Times after the publication of reports concerning his [tax returns](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/donald-trump-chooses-biglaw-firm-to-fight-new-york-times-over-publication-of-tax-documents/) and several women’s [sexual assault allegations](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/donald-trumps-biglaw-firm-threatens-to-sue-new-york-times-over-publication-of-sexual-assault-allegations/), while name partner David Friedman served as Trump’s campaign adviser on U.S.-Israel relations.

Friedman was later nominated — and then confirmed — to become the U.S. Ambassador to Israel. Friedman was confirmed by the Senate on March 23, and he was scrubbed from the firm’s name the very next day. Was this a political maneuver to distance the firm from the Trump administration?

Not at all, says name partner Daniel Benson. The firm will now be known as Kasowitz Benson Torres due to New York ethics rules. [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/kasowitz-benson-chops-off-the-friedman/) has the details:

Despite sensitivity over Kasowitz’s connection to Donald Trump, who has been a client of the firm for over 15 years, the name change had nothing to do with politics, according to nameplate partner Daniel Benson.

Reached by phone, Benson stated that the firm was thrilled at the appointment of Friedman, and that the name change was required to meet New York Rules of Professional Conduct, which stipulate that law firms cannot include the names of a living, non-employed lawyer in their trade name. Friedman has been with Kasowitz since 1994.

A name partner isn’t the only thing the firm has lost since its close affiliation with Trump was revealed. According to the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202782581832/Kasowitz-Reports-Down-Year-Trims-Firm-Name-as-ExPartner-Assumes-Ambassador-Post?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=4), in 2016, the firm’s gross revenue decreased by 7.5 percent to $217 million, its net income decreased by 10.5 percent to $72.5 million, and its headcount decreased by 6.7 percent, dropping from 282 to 263. This is the second year in a row that the firm’s financial metrics have declined.

Nevertheless, Kasowitz says the reaction within the firm to Friedman’s elevation to the ambassador position was “hugely [ed. note: YUGEly?] positive.” Per an [announcement](http://www.kasowitz.com/kasowitz-benson-torres-llp-2017/) on its website, the firm will continue to “focus on complex commercial litigation and sophisticated real estate transactions” in Friedman’s wake.

Last week marked the beginning of National Hispanic Heritage Month, which extends from September 15 to October 15. Now is the perfect time to discuss the contributions of Latinos and Latinas in Biglaw and, in particular, to highlight our community’s representation in top Am Law firm leadership roles. As a Cuban-American, this is a topic close to my heart. Undoubtedly there is still much room for improvement, but the good news is that we increasingly have reason to celebrate!

Over the past couple of years, Am Law 100 firms have redoubled their efforts to increase diversity in their ranks. And when it comes to Latino and Latina lawyers, we are starting to see progress at various levels. The American Lawyer’s 2022 Diversity Scorecard indicated the most significant year-over-year improvement since 2001. Large law firms [hired 1.5% more Hispanic associates](https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2022/05/aba-study-big-law-firms-hired-more/), which was a greater rate of increase than for any other racial/ethnic group. At the partnership level, there was a [2.6% increase in Hispanic/Latino equity partners](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/diversity-inclusion-center/2021-md-survey-2nd-edition.pdf) from 2019 to 2020.

But the most visible achievements have come at the top of the Biglaw pyramid, with an increasing number of Am Law firms now featuring Latino or Latina managing partners. Let’s take a look at these luminaries whose success is proof that the pinnacle of the profession is open to Latino and Latina attorneys, notwithstanding the inevitable challenges.

Yvette Ostolaza — Chair of the Management Committee, Sidley Austin

As the sole Latina at the helm of an Am Law firm, [Yvette Ostolaza](https://www.sidley.com/en/people/o/ostolaza-yvette)’s journey is particularly inspiring. Born in Miami to Cuban parents, Ostolaza attended the University of Miami School of Law and first made partner as a litigator in the Dallas office of Weil, Gotshal & Manges. She joined Sidley in 2013 as managing partner of the Dallas office and served as global co-leader of Sidley’s litigation practice before her elevation to Chair of the Management Committee in April 2022. She was recently honored by the Hispanic National Bar Association with the Mari Carmen Aponte Award, which recognizes a “Latina lawyer who is the first to break a glass ceiling.”

Miguel A. Zaldivar, Jr. — CEO, Hogan Lovells

Born in Venezuela to Cuban refugee parents, [Miguel Zaldivar](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/miguel-zaldivar) did not emigrate to the United States until adulthood. After graduating from the University of Miami School of Law, he joined Hogan Lovells and set about building a Miami-based Latin America project finance practice. As a partner, he became co-leader of the Hogan Lovells Infrastructure, Energy, Resources and Projects practice. In 2018, he relocated to Hong Kong to manage the firm’s 14 offices in Asia and the Middle East. Zaldivar began serving as Hogan Lovells CEO in 2020.

Frank Lopez — Managing Partner and Chair-Elect, Paul Hastings

Currently in the number-two role at Paul Hastings, [Frank Lopez](https://www.paulhastings.com/professionals/franklopez) will assume the top leadership post (Chair) on October 15. The New York securities lawyer and former investment banker only arrived at the firm in 2019. A graduate of Georgetown University Law Center, Lopez spent 15 years at Proskauer Rose before jumping to Paul Hastings. In his relatively short Paul Hastings tenure, Lopez has succeeded in raising the firm’s profile in leveraged finance and has played a key role in attracting lateral partners from firms such as Skadden and Covington & Burling.

Wally Martinez — Managing Partner, Hunton Andrews Kurth

Unlike his colleagues on this list, [Wally Martinez](https://www.huntonak.com/en/people/wally-martinez.html)’s ascent to the helm of a major law firm is not a recent development. Born in Manhattan and raised in New Jersey by Cuban emigre parents, Martinez graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He first made partner at Holland & Knight in Miami before leaving to found a new Hunton & Williams Miami office in 1999. Martinez served briefly as general counsel at Diageo North America before returning to Hunton & Williams as managing partner in 2006. He has remained at the helm through the merger with the former Andrews Kurth Kenyon. For many years, Martinez was the only Latino leading an Am Law firm, so the fact that he now has significant company in the Am Law leadership ranks is especially noteworthy. 

A rising generation of leaders

The four leaders profiled above occupy particularly visible roles, but it is worth acknowledging in addition the rising generation of Latino and Latina lawyers poised to ascend to top posts in the coming years. To take just one example of a Latino partner to watch, [Eduardo Fernandez](https://www.willkie.com/professionals/f/fernandez-eduardo-j) currently serves as co-head of the European Committee at Willkie Farr and co-managing partner of the Paris office. A native New Yorker who received his J.D. from NYU, Fernandez began his career as a Wilkie Farr associate in New York. He is now recognized as one of the leading M&A and private equity lawyers in France.

# 2020 Will Be The Hardest Compensation Year Since The Great Recession
## Law firm leaders: brace yourselves for agonizing partner compensation decisions.

Back in March, the sky seemed like it was falling. COVID-19 went from background noise to an all-consuming issue seemingly overnight. Firms were suddenly faced with instantly and safely transitioning their attorneys, staff, and practices to long-term teleworking. The economy sputtered to a stop, and no one knew what next week held, much less next month or next year.

Since then, at least in the legal industry as a whole, things seem to have gone sorta, maybe, possibly okay. Hard recent statistics are difficult to come by, but anecdotally it seems that most midsize and large firms were able to avoid catastrophe. An industry-wide strong Q1 gave most firms momentum to carry them through the initial uncertainty, and many appear to have tightened up their collections timelines to bring revenue in more quickly and cover the gaps caused by COVID-19 in Q2. As the economy reopened in fits and starts across the country, many firms saw their new matter and revenue numbers climb back after a distressing down period.

But while the 30,000-foot view may suggest the industry experienced a gentle tumble and smooth recovery, as we zoom in we see a vastly more variable experience. Some practices and attorneys have seen their books boom. If Zoom’s outside counsel legal spend hasn’t increased since March, I’ll eat my hat.

Other practices haven’t been so lucky. Lawyers may have seen their biggest clients go dormant, or even out of business. Some entire practice areas are idle. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know 2020 may not be a banner year for hospitality, commercial leasing, and aviation lawyers.

Managing this thrash and variability has been a significant challenge for firm leadership in the past several months, as some practice groups struggle to stay afloat while others rake in the dough. Those issues are set to truly come to a head as we reach the end of many firms’ fiscal years and enter compensation and bonus season.

Deciding how to split up the firm pie is a contentious, painful affair in the best of years. 2020’s compensation season is shaping up to be one of the hardest since the Great Recession. While firms aren’t in the aggregate seeing the same revenue contractions they saw in ’08, the volatility and uncertainty of COVID-19 pose a different, but just as tough set of challenges.

Lawyers who had a COVID-driven bad year are in the tough spot of having their book torpedoed by essentially an act of God. No one wants to admit they caused their firm a net loss on the year, much less take a pay cut in the next year. Some might be justifiably expecting a huge bounce back or even a boom period in 2021 as things return to normal. Those attorneys will argue long and hard to keep their comp from getting slashed.

But every dollar paid to currently underperforming attorneys is a dollar that’s not available to reward those folks who made the firm bank despite, or perhaps because of, the pandemic. Those attorneys will surely want to see bonuses and will be demanding a higher base comp figure heading into next year. Those who don’t get their demands met could credibly threaten to walk out the door to a firm that will be happy to pay them more.

And we can’t forget that COVID-19 demanded a huge amount of firm leadership and staff. Hours upon hours of nonchargeable time were poured into fundamentally reshaping how our firms operate day-to-day. Without that tremendous lift, many firms would have sputtered out. Rarely, if ever, has more been demanded of lawyers and staff on the administrative side of the law. Those efforts to keep the ship afloat have to be rewarded, right?

All of this is happening against the backdrop of some of the most uncertain times in living memory. Many management teams will see that uncertainty and want to trim back the compensation budget to weather any further hits to the economy. Even in cases where this is a prudent move, some leaders will view this as politically untenable and may choose to roll the dice, close their eyes, and hope 2021 ends up better than [many economists predict](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/08/24/economists-warn-us-gdp-wont-recover-to-pre-pandemic-levels-until-2022/#10d0dd205078).

Even in the biggest of boom years, where every partner in a practice smashes their revenue records, there will be battles over who gets what share of the pie. The battles will still happen because attorneys will always want to argue their case, do better than their neighbor, and get that much closer to funding their retirement/kid’s college/new sports car/next golf vacation. The basic problem of setting annual comp isn’t something that can be solved with money.

For firm management, the way out of this mess is to find a way to broaden our attorneys’ definition of success to something more than just dollars. There will almost always be an irrational bidder out in the market willing to lure our partners away with more money than we can offer. The firms that will navigate the coming months best are the ones that have long been actively developing their internal culture and sense of camaraderie. By making our current situation a great one, a place we can call home, we both make the day-to-day of firm life better and ensure our teams stay together.

Developing culture doesn’t happen overnight. It requires valuing the contributions of everyone in the firm, from the practice group leaders to the night custodians. It takes knowing who we are and what we’re doing, communicating that mission, and getting everyone bought in.

If we don’t teach our people to value one another, all they have left to value is their paychecks. That’s a losing proposition for any management team.

Care for your people first. The rest will follow.

# Biglaw Firms' Lack Of Transparency During COVID-19 Is Making Associates Anxious
## If there were ever a time to take associate mental health seriously, that time is now.

Biglaw associates have been working through a pandemic for about seven months now. From their remote work environments, they’ve witnessed not just austerity measures like salary cuts, furloughs, and layoffs, but the deaths of more than 200,000 people thanks to COVID-19 in the United States alone. Anxiety and depression have set in, and Biglaw firms that aren’t being transparent with their associates are making things even worse.

How bad has it gotten? According to the American Lawyer’s 2020 Midlevel Associates Survey, more than 40 percent of respondents said they had anxiety, with three-in-four claiming their firms had negatively impacted their mental health. Summer associates who worked remotely this summer were also [increasingly concerned](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/thanks-to-covid-19-biglaw-summer-associates-are-very-concerned-about-job-security-money/) about their mental health (about 48 percent of them said they were concerned this year, up from 39 percent last year).

What’s driving the increase in stress and anxiety is the fact that some law firms haven’t been transparent enough with their associates, which is making them feel uncertain about their job security. “Control and embargo of information [about] finances, staffing decisions, and cutbacks only breeds anxiety and reduces productivity,” said a fifth-year associate at an Am Law 100 firm in response to the Am Law Midlevel Survey. Luckily, there are things Biglaw firms can do to help their associates through these difficult times.

Transparency and communication is the most common antidote, [Anne Brafford, founder of legal well-being consultancy Aspire Legal,] said. While personal coping techniques such as exercise and mental tricks can help, the greatest influence lies in law firm leadership. That includes all partners, not just the executive committee.

“Firms that have been focusing on transparency will go a long way toward reducing anxiety,” Brafford said. “I don’t just mean firm leadership, but the day-to-day communication about what’s to being expected, how am I doing—following up.”

Firms that remain transparent with their associates — whether dealing with salary or staffing issues — will be able to provide the support these lawyers need during this time of crisis. Offer associates some certainty during an era of uncertainty. Invest meaningfully in associates’ mental health and everyone will be much happier.

Thanks to an uncertain economy, corporate practice may be struggling a bit right now but litigation seems to be humming along quite nicely. As always, clients want the very best of the best when it comes to the law firms that are handling their litigation matters. According to a new ranking from BTI Consulting Group, certain firms seem to be doing better than others in clients’ eyes when it comes to their grasp on novel work. From BTI’s [Mad Clientist](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/clients-name-55-law-firms-moving-upmarket-in-litigation-poised-for-the-new-types-of-matters) blog:

COVID-19 matters are becoming a memory and the new types of matters are gaining a strong head of steam. Clients want law firms ahead of this curve — and this is where the most complex work lies.

Clients want firms moving upmarket that are able to handle the new types of matters and better handle the old.

So, which firms are at the top of their game from the most important view of all, that of their clients? The list is quite long — 55! — but any firm that made the list is likely thrilled to be here:

# Mo' Money, Mo' Cravath Matches!
## Which firm is the latest to match the Cravath bonus scale?

Another hour, another Cravath match. Biglaw associates would probably be getting bored of this if there weren’t tens of thousands — or in the case of senior associates, hundreds of thousands — of dollars involved. Which firm is the latest to match the Cravath bonus scale?

That would be Shearman & Sterling, which has matched the market leader on bonuses, be it Cravath or Davis Polk, for at least the past five years. This year’s match is no surprise, but we’re sure associates are thrilled that bonus bucks will be flowing into their accounts on January 12, 2018. The firm’s bonus memo is on the next page.

That’s our take on the Shearman & Sterling bonuses. If you’re a lawyer at the firm, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we promise we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us at 646-820-8477. We look forward to hearing from you.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

But, while the lawsuits all make headlines when the complaint is served, often times [mandatory arbitration clauses](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/mandatory-arbitration-agreements/) as part of partnership arrest the litigation process and transfer it to confidential arbitration.

One plaintiff who’s had success in challenging her former firm’s arbitration gambit is [Constance Ramos](https://akira-ip.com/background-%26-experience), who sued Winston & Strawn [alleging the firm treated her as “an appendage of a male superior”](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/winston-strawn-is-the-latest-biglaw-firm-to-face-a-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-by-a-former-partner/?rf=1) and that the firm tried to get rid of her once the male equity partner she worked with departed the firm. In November, a three-judge panel of the California Court of Appeal found that the arbitration clause was unconscionable and therefore unenforceable. Winston & Strawn is seeking to have that decision overturned.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/07/31/ex-winston-partner-suing-firm-asks-justices-to-uphold-a-ruling-against-arbitration/) Law.com, Winston & Strawn’s lawyer, Joshua Rosenkranz of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, is arguing the Federal Arbitration Act should control and that the lower courts need a “reminder” about how preemption should work:

“In the wake of [AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion], no other jurisdiction has held that arbitration-specific rules like these survive FAA preemption,” Rosenkranz told the justices in May. He argued that “California courts need another reminder” to follow the Supreme Court’s precedence on enforcement of arbitration agreements. “It is time,” Rosenkranz wrote.

But Ramos’s attorney, Karla Gilbride of Public Justice, argued that it was the unusual terms of Winston’s arbitration agreement that forced the lower court’s decision:

The law firm’s “overly harsh” terms in its partnership agreement drove the lower court opinion, Gilbride told the justices Wednesday. Chief among those terms that the lower court found unconscionable, Gilbride said, was the “firm always wins” clause. That provision, with one exception, barred the arbitration panel from substituting its judgment for the decisions of the partnership, its executive committee or officers.

That clause, Gilbride said, “would make it impossible for the arbitrators to award Ramos back pay, front pay, reinstatement or punitive damages—essentially every form of relief she sought in her complaint for employment discrimination and retaliation.”

But Winston & Strawn isn’t the only Biglaw firm hoping the Supreme Court will take a stand on the side of arbitration. Ropes & Gray has filed an amicus brief in the case:

Ropes & Gray filed an amicus brief supporting Winston & Strawn. “Today, it is common for law firms to experience regular fluctuations in their partnership ranks,” Douglas Hallward-Driemeier, head of the firm’s appellate and Supreme Court practice, said in the brief. “As a result, it has become increasingly important for law firms to be able to quickly and efficiently resolve internal disputes in a way that protects confidential information and minimizes disruptions to client service.”

Whatever the outcome, it’s clear it will have a big impact on Biglaw.

# Biglaw Firm Delights With Associate Bonuses That Are Pure Magic
## Voila! Firm made money appear in associates' bank accounts!

Biggie might have said Mo Money Mo Problems, but that adage doesn’t hold up in Biglaw. It’s bonus season and big firms are busy showering associates with money to show them just how much they’re appreciated.

At Allen & Overy, bonus time has officially arrived. The good news for associates — well, at least the associates at A&O’s New York, D.C., Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, and Sao Paulo offices — is that the bonus numbers are in, and it’s a match of the prevailing market rate. Which, given the firm made $2,272,016,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 12th on the Global 200 ranking, isn’t much of a surprise.

In case you’ve forgotten the scale, here it is in a handy chart.

Once, while planting a garden, I faced a dilemma: how high should the fence be? Too low, and there’d be no privacy; too high, and it might block the sun or seem unwelcoming to neighbors. This balancing act between privacy and openness reminded me of the delicate governance issues surrounding AI, particularly in legal work where privacy.

Understanding AI Governance In Legal Work: Tending

In law, the integration of AI poses unique challenges. Like deciding on the height of a garden fence, legal teams must balance the benefits of AI with the need to protect client confidentiality and adhere to privacy laws. Here’s a deeper look at the governance aspects:

Data Protection And AI

Just as my garden needed protection from prying eyes, AI in legal work involves safeguarding vast amounts of sensitive data. It’s like creating a fortress around your legal garden of information.

Compliance With Legal Standards

Much like a garden fence adheres to zoning laws, AI applications must comply with existing legal standards and regulations. It’s about building within the legal boundaries.

Client Confidentiality

The whispering leaves of a tree can be compared to maintaining client confidentiality. Legal teams must ensure AI tools don’t inadvertently spill the beans (or sensitive information).

Practical Governance Strategies For Legal Teams: Nurturing Legal Growth

Drawing from the garden fence analogy, here are some strategies for legal teams:

Establish Clear AI Usage Policies

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Think of AI usage policies as the rules for your private garden. Set clear boundaries for what’s allowed and what isn’t in the world of legal AI.

Regularly Review Compliance

Just as a vigilant gardener checks fence boundaries, ensure your AI tools consistently comply with evolving legal standards. No loopholes in this well-tended legal garden!

Client Data Protection

Implement robust measures to protect client data in AI applications — it’s like having a secure, appropriately scaled garden fence that keeps the right and wrong things in.

Train Teams On Privacy And AI

Educate your legal team about the importance of privacy and confidentiality in AI applications. Think of it as instilling a sense of respect for the sacred boundaries of your legal garden.

Conduct Regular AI Audits

Regular audits of AI tools are like inspecting a fence for gaps or weaknesses. Patch up any vulnerabilities to ensure your legal garden remains secure and flourishing.

Transparent Communication With Clients

Just as good neighbors communicate openly, keep your clients in the loop about how their data is being used in AI applications. Transparency builds trust, much like sharing gardening tips with your neighbors.

Tending To The Legal Garden With Precision

In the world of legal AI, just as the right fence height balances privacy with openness, the right governance strategies ensure a harmonious dance between the benefits of AI and the need for privacy and confidentiality. By establishing clear policies, ensuring compliance, protecting client data, and educating legal teams, we can navigate the intricate world of AI in legal governance. This approach not only safeguards client trust but also ensures that the use of AI in legal work remains both ethical and effective — much like a well-maintained garden fence that serves its purpose without overstepping its bounds. So, legal gardeners, tend to your legal gardens with care and watch them flourish!

[L]aw firms need to think about ways they can help lawyers further along in their careers continue business development activities remotely. And for all lawyers, law firms need to remain focused on mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic impacts not only the physical health of attorneys, but also their mental health, as they could be dealing with anxiety, isolation, financial hardship, personal losses and any number of other mental health challenges. These are issues many law firms have not tackled head-on yet, likely because law firm leadership has hoped (like the rest of us) that we would all be back in the office by now. But as we are staring down months more of working from home, it is time for law firms to take this issue more seriously and come up with a plan to make sure their young lawyers do not fall behind.

— an excerpt from an essay written by the Young Lawyer Editorial Board of the American Lawyer, assessing [how Biglaw firms have fared](https://www.law.com/2020/11/20/room-for-improvement-young-lawyers-assess-law-firms-pandemic-response/) in their response to the pandemic. “Firms have largely done well by young lawyers during the pandemic,” they write. “But as it continues, changes are needed.”

# What Are Clients Saying About You Behind Your Back?

…to get folks to take a survey.

How do clients see the law firm ecosystem? Which firms do they trust and for what work? If you’re trying to build a practice, shouldn’t you know what lawyers clients trust in that space so you can shape your practice to compete?

And if you’re already on top, don’t you want as many people to know that as possible?

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
For the last few years, Above the Law has put together a [Top Outside Counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2022/) report featuring input from corporate counsel and in-house attorneys at around 440 companies, ranging from small and medium-sized private companies to large public corporations. For the 2022 edition, let’s really blow this out and get responses from the biggest cross-section of clients ever. The more information we get, the more illuminating this report will be.

Lawyers get a lot of survey requests and there are almost certainly in-house attorneys out there that just breezed over our request. So it’s time for outside counsel to do their part and make sure clients are participating in the survey.

It helps firms. It helps legal departments. There’s no reason we can’t get massive participation here.

Get them [to the survey here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dbYjoUTbxaPdwea).

After a month of wondering whether Biglaw as a collective will get on board with associate raises, it looks like we finally have our answer. Today a bunch of firms announced they’d be matching the prevailing market rate, set by the combination of Milbank and Davis Polk. And we don’t expect the good news to stop any time soon.

The latest firm to announce raises is Proskauer Rose. The firm took in $989,981,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it 43rd on the Am Law 100, and now they’re sharing that largesse with the hardworking associates.

Proskauer Rose will be paying associates according to the following grid:



These raises will be retroactive to January 1 and will be paid on March 15th. You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/proskauer-raises-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Stat Of The Week: Legal Staff Are Stressed

In an era of pandemic, layoffs, and remote work, legal staff are increasing their productivity while many experience declining mental health, according to a survey released this week. 

“[The Paralegal and the Pandemic](https://www.athennian.com/post/coronavirus-impact-on-paralegals),” a survey from the legal technology company Athennian, reveals that 63% of respondents report increased productivity when working remotely — with almost half ranking their productivity level at 8 or above on a scale of 1-10 — while 41% say their workload has increased. 

Participants also rated declining mental health as the top personal impact of the pandemic, with 36% saying their mental health is suffering.

[In an interview](https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2020/12/pandemic-pushes-paralegals-to-work-more-and-worry-more-survey-finds.html) with Above the Law contributor Bob Ambrogi, Athennian CEO Adrian Camara described the negative effects of the pandemic on legal staff: 

We found that, in general, paralegals are experiencing significant pressures, including increasing workloads and anxiety around Covid-19, all of which have had an impact on mental health. They are experiencing family health issues, the loss of colleagues, lost income, and isolation.”

The survey respondents include 323 legal professionals who are not lawyers, with the majority being paralegals. More than 88% of respondents were from the U.S. or Canada, and 64% work in law firms.

# Why Are Some Judges So Mean?
## Judges are often overworked with little resources, and many judges still manage to treat most people who appear before them with courtesy and respect.

Recently, I was sitting in court watching a pro se party square off against a seasoned attorney in a case the pro se party was sure to lose. The pro se party did not know the procedures of the court, and he stumbled frequently as he asked questions of the witnesses and made arguments. The judge was somewhat mean to the pro se party and made statements that were sure to rattle the pro se party and would be difficult for any attorney to handle. This got me thinking of all the judges I have appeared in front of in my career who were mean and disrespectful to litigants and counsel. I am not sure why so many judges treat parties and their lawyers in a caustic manner, but perhaps a few reasons can explain this.

Judges often have busy dockets and not enough resources to handle all of the cases assigned to them. When attorneys or parties come unprepared, it might frustrate a judge since this may slow down the judicial process and make it more difficult for judges to complete all of the tasks they need to oversee in the course of their duties. In my experience, judges usually do not act mean toward lawyers or litigants who are prepared and reserve their ire for those who are not prepared when they come to court.

Of course, most judges were practicing attorneys, and they should know from their own experiences how difficult being a lawyer can be tough. One might think judges would have sympathy for the burdens of practicing lawyers and cut attorneys a break when they show shortcomings in court. However, judges often do not seem to empathize with the plight of legal practitioners, possibly because jurists are confronted with the expectations of clearing their dockets and ensuring that cases are being timely disposed.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Some judges might also be mean to litigants and attorneys because this is an efficient way to manage a courtroom. Judges often only have a limited time to hear certain matters, and lawyers love to talk. In certain instances, judges need to interject when lawyers have made their point and judges may need to confront a lawyer when the attorney makes a point that is not particularly helpful to resolving a controversy. In addition, being a little mean can be an effective way to create respect (and dare I say fear) for the court and reign in lawyers who might otherwise waste the court’s time.

Although I do not want to assume the worst in people, in some instances, judges might be mean simply because power goes to their head, or they have a bad personality. People are ordinarily very respectful of judges, both in their personal and professional lives, and this might give judges an inflated sense of themselves. Judges are bestowed with extraordinary powers, and it is often very difficult to seek review of a judge’s decision. It is entirely possible that all of this power and treatment impacts a judge’s temperament and how they act in court.

I want to make perfectly clear that I have an incredible amount of respect for judges. Being a jurist is a difficult job, and many people have to take a pay cut to become a judge. Judges are often overworked with little resources, and many judges still manage to treat most people who appear before them with courtesy and respect. However, some judges are just outright mean, either because they lose patience with stakeholders to a controversy or because it is an effective method to manage a courtroom. In any event, I would love to hear from judges about why some jurists seem to be outright mean and do not treat parties and lawyers with an appropriate degree of respect. And if any lawyers have stories of judges acting particularly discourteous, I’d love to hear such anecdotes as well.

A former Biglaw attorney, Tom Hagyard, has been sentenced to eight years in prison on sexual assault charges. The charges stem from an October 2017 house party in West London, England. Hagyard had recently begun working at Eversheds Sutherland, and attended a housewarming party with some colleagues.

At the party, Hagyard assaulted two women, one of whom was a law student,[ as described by](https://www.legalcheek.com/2021/10/ex-eversheds-trainee-who-sexually-assaulted-two-sleeping-students-at-house-party-jailed-for-8-years/) Legal Cheek:

That evening Hagyard attacked the law student, then in her 20s, while she was passed out on the party host’s bed, before going on to touch another student, also in her 20s, underneath her bra while she slept on a sofa.

The ex-rookie insisted the sexual activity was consensual, telling Isleworth Crown Court that both women were “enjoying it”.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Hagyard was convicted of two counts of assault by penetration and two counts of sexual assault. The jury did not reach a verdict on one count of rape.

The victim impact statements revealed how the assaults have played out in the lives of the women:

In their victim impact statements, the first woman explained how the attack had left her “with chronic stress, anxiety, insomnia and panic attacks”, while the second victim revealed how she had been “grieving for the loss of my old self” and had been treated for a paracetamol overdose in the run-up to the trial.

Hagyard was suspended from Eversheds Sutherland following his arrest, and never resumed his position. He formally left the firm in June 2018.

# Associate Raises? Sure, Man. Counsel Raises? A Sterling Idea!

Every raise cycle brings excitement and congratulations for associates and frowns and consternation for counsel. If raise announcements even acknowledge the existence of counsel, it’s to say that counsel will be hearing about compensation individually… eventually. Not exactly encouraging.

Sometimes this works out to counsel earning less than senior associates.

We’ve now heard from Shearman & Sterling, and it’s a match of the new associate scale as expected. But there’s one exciting tidbit for the counsel.

First, the grid:



As usual, counsel are not included in that grid, but the memo takes the extra step of acknowledging the firm’s counsel as human beings and professionals:

We are committed to attracting and retaining the best associate talent. In this regard, we will also be increasing our counsel base salaries by $15,000.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Great news! And recognition that treating counsel right is key to recruiting the best associate talent. Not to crib from an NCAA commercial, but there are a lot of Biglaw associates and most of them are going pro as something other than a Biglaw partner. Demonstrating that the firm will honor loyal senior attorneys in the counsel role sends a positive message to associates about the place.

Congratulations to all.

# Hot Law Firm Practices In A Trump Presidency
## Am Law firms are sharing with Lateral Link recruiters their predictions for the legal practice areas that will experience growth in a Trump presidency.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on lateral moves from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Ata Farhadi](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/106) is a Director of associate, partner, and in-house recruiting at Lateral Link. He recruits for Am Law 200 firms, smaller boutiques, and corporations ranging from financial institutions to major entertainment and media outlets. As a Director at Lateral Link, Ata offers market analysis, résumé advice, interview strategy and related services to attorneys across the United States, Europe and Asia. Ata is also a proud alumnus of Pembroke College, Oxford, and the University of Southern California (Go Trojans!) and is always happy to hear from alumni of either school.

With the election this week of Republican Donald Trump, Am Law firms are sharing with Lateral Link recruiters their predictions for the legal practice areas that will experience growth in a Trump presidency.

Here’s what we’re hearing thus far.

- Domestically Focused Project Finance/Infrastructure Practice Groups Will Grow in 2017. Your Way in to Project Finance?
A number of partners are predicting a desire to grow their Project Finance practice groups under a Trump administration. They tell us that firms will likely be interested in growing groups with attorneys who represent sponsors, lenders, investors, and contractors, and given the Trump campaign’s statements objecting against the flow of funds and investment to other countries, we expect growth to begin primarily in the domestic project finance market (apparently partners focusing on Mexican and Latin American infrastructure investment are already receiving calls from concerned clients, according to the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202771987150/Big-Law-Braces-for-Impact-After-Trump-Victory?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=1&slreturn=20161010163824), and the Mexican Peso plummeted over 11% at one point to a new all-time low against the US Dollar).

One firm told us that partners with experience in public-private partnerships will be in huge demand. Why? Because public-private partnerships are a great compromise to getting infrastructure projects off the ground, specifically in the industries of transportation, sports/entertainment, telecommunications, oil and gas, hospitality, and construction/commercial development. At Lateral Link, we expect special focus on areas where Trump has the most connections: namely sports, entertainment, and construction, a projection confirmed in recent conversations with one law firm partner who expects firms to bring in more EPC partners (“engineering, procurement, and construction”) going forward.

In California, where I recruit, we have recently seen an increase in the number of associates interested in project finance work. Traditionally, project finance groups have been relatively strict in requiring prior relevant experience in the industry from those associates seeking Am Law 200 positions, and at the mid-level that will very likely continue, despite a tight candidate-driven lateral market.

For more junior associates interested in project finance, we expect an ever more increasing receptivity to the idea of retooling folks from other finance practices and openings both at larger and smaller practices. In fact, my colleagues and I are currently working on one or more such positions which we are happy to share with interested attorneys.

See [here](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/an-americas-infrastructure-first-plan/) for a list of infrastructure projects a future Trump administration hopes to fund.

- Banking Groups in Am Law Firms Will Grow in 2017
Despite the Republican party platform calling for a breaking up of the big banks, it is commonly expected for now that Trump’s policies will deregulate the banking and finance sectors, sectors which, on the stock market, have already responded with a significant jump in value. It is not entirely clear which regulations might be in line for the chop (banks have spent so much money on compliance with Dodd-Frank that they [reportedly](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/business/dealbook/trump-expected-to-seek-deep-cuts-in-business-regulations.html) would rather keep it), but either way, our clients have clearly stated a desire to build out their banking practices in anticipation of market growth (driven partly by the projected increased investment in infrastructure), and associates at all levels working for lenders or borrowers can expect a rise in the number of opportunities at major Am Law firms come 2017 both from new lateral partner hires and a general increase in firm business.

- Where Infrastructure Goes, Expect Real Estate to Follow
The development of infrastructure is intimately tied to the development of other real estate. A moment’s reflection makes this plain. If, for example, we see new sports and entertainment facilities and other commercial construction, surrounding real estate will no doubt be bought up and/or otherwise developed — a well-documented pattern which isn’t rocket science. Many of the firms we work with will be hiring additional real estate attorneys as a consequence of the above, and real estate associates in both transactions and finance representing all participants can expect an even more open lateral market as a result.

- FCPA Will Continue to Be a Hot Area
Although Republican administrations are known to favor big business, it is important to note that Trump has placed a strong emphasis both on rooting out “corruption” and the stifling of outbound investment: goals his administration are expected to try and achieve by use of the FCPA (among other methods). Enactment of the FCPA has in recent times led to an explosion in the lateral market, with several high-profile hires having been made from government into law firms seeking to build their expertise. Despite recorded criticism of the FCPA by Trump, our clients only see this upward trend continuing, which should expand partnership promotion prospects and the associate lateral market in general.

- Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Counseling and Litigation Will Continue to Grow in 2017
With high-profile intrusions into both government and private networks compromising the personal information of over 1/3 of the nation’s population over the last several years (take two or three of the biggest intrusions and you’re already at well over 100 million people — not including simple password theft), cybersecurity and data privacy law has been on the uptick for quite some time, and the Trump campaign’s short cybersecurity policy statement can be found [here](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/cyber-security/). In the lateral market, law firm counsel and partner lateral hires have come not only from law firms but also (given the new-ish nature of the practice) from cybersecurity companies where lawyers had formerly been building their expertise. Associates can expect their demand to rise as these groups grow, with a preference for attorneys with industry specific counseling and litigation experience (meaning that any associates with experience at the most successful privacy groups in the Am Law 200 will be in high demand at other firms seeking to build out). Expect opportunities at larger AND smaller shops in both in pre-intrusion counseling and post-intrusion investigations and litigation, with an emphasis on the former.

- An Overall Reduction in White Collar Investigations and a Possible Increase in Federal Court Cases Is Something to Watch Out for
It’s still early days, but with Trump’s avowed dislike of Dodd-Frank, and recent Republican attempts in the form of the Financial Choice Act to roll back its provisions, it would be wise to watch out for changes at the S.E.C. Combine that with S.E.C. budget cuts common to most Republican presidencies and you can see where things might be headed. Attempts to change both the venue of certain S.E.C. cases (throwing them from efficient bench-driven administrative hearings back into federal court with full discovery and jury trials) and a Republican-proposed increase in the standard of evidence required for a conviction may result in the elimination of more cost-efficient administrative hearings and a corresponding drop in actions owing to budget constraints as well as an increase in the number of actions filed in federal court.

- Other Areas Like Health care and M&A
Obviously, Trump’s election will have all manner of effects on other areas of the law, not least of all health care, and quite possibly M&A. After only 48 hours, however, it is still unclear what these effects might be. A total repeal of Obamacare is considered unlikely, for example, though change is inevitable, and while Trump has reportedly [threatened](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-att-time-warner-trump-20161110-story.html) to put the kibosh on AT&T’s Time Warner acquisition and a brief pause in deals is thought likely as companies assess, there’s no consensus at this point regarding the trajectory of the market in these areas other than an expectation of “more of the same” in the short term. If you’d like to be kept abreast of the latest intelligence as we receive it, get in touch or give any of our recruiters a call and we’ll be happy to keep you in the loop.

# The Global Legal News You Need, When You Need It
## News and analysis from this company could be a game-changer for legal professionals working globally.

For attorneys operating on a global scale, staying ahead of the latest regulatory decisions and enforcement trends is a top priority. Working on that scale, however, often means those attorneys will have little time to track every development.

That’s where MLex, a unique news service acquired by LexisNexis, comes in.

Above the Law recently got in touch with MLex co-founder Lewis Crofts, who now serves as the outlet’s editor-at-large, and product director Bryn Hughes to get a full picture of how attorneys are using MLex to stay on top of worldwide legal developments, safeguard clients and spot potential business development opportunities.

Global Coverage for US Attorneys

MLex specializes in covering matters related to antitrust actions, mergers and acquisitions, data privacy and security matters, financial crime, sector-specific regulation and trade.

The coverage spans the globe, written by journalists who go to lengths to explain why a news story matters to local markets. For example, MLex’s US reporters are skilled at explaining why something happening in China is relevant to US attorneys and companies.

“For the kinds of things we cover, regulation has gone global… If you’re doing any merger worth its salt, it’s going to be a global deal. If you’re going to fix prices, you might as well fix them globally or in numerous countries,” says Crofts.

“Global is very much our watchword, and we’ve got people in Japan, Korea, Brazil, America, Europe, and the rest of it ,” he adds.

Though MLex does primarily cover matters with a global impact, Crofts is quick to clarify that the company also monitors and reports on national-level matters — especially if those matters might later become relevant on a larger scale.

Access to such geographically wide-ranging coverage presents a unique opportunity for attorneys working at global law firms and in-house counsel at international corporations to stay ahead of regulatory trends from a big-picture perspective.

MLex doesn’t stop at just breaking news, however, and its team of well-connected reporters also creates analysis of trends and individual events, as well as special reports and official document access, to give subscribers a well rounded view of what’s what in global regulation, dealmaking, and white collar crime.

Multi-Level Coverage Written By Expert Journalists

The core of MLex’s journalism is old-fashioned, boots-on-the-ground reporting supported by a carefully developed network of expert sources, according to Crofts.

“Frankly, when you are dealing with business news, there is no replacement for breaking a scoop that moves share price,” he says.

“If someone gets imprisoned or someone gets sanctioned by a court at 9:30, because the Supreme Court hands down its judgment at 9:30, we need that story at 9:30 and thirty seconds.”

While MLex does love to be the first to break a story, what really sets the service apart is what its reporters do with a story after it’s been broken.

Within a day or so after publishing the straight news version of a story, MLex follows up on the initial story with in-depth analysis based on the reporters’ deep expertise and interviews with subject matter experts who have direct ties to the matter at hand.

MLex analysis looks beyond the outcome of a specific suit to place that outcome in a larger context, including how a seemingly isolated outcome might impact other matters a company is involved in.

Accuracy is also a top priority for MLex, Crofts says, and news or analysis articles are only published after an extremely thorough editing process.

“We only have our good name,” Crofts says. “So we have several pairs of eyes on all stories, three layers of editing teams double-, triple-sourcing to make sure what we put out there is not conjecture.”

“In this business, there are a lot of people who have an interest in bending narratives, so there is a rigorous editorial process involving senior journalists, and chief correspondents and editors around the world to check and double check,” he adds.

And to ensure the full picture is accessible, alongside the content written by their journalists, MLex also publishes key public documents (including court and regulatory decisions, and company statements). With time of the essence for their subscribers, MLex offers a one-stop-shop for original reporting and source documents on any given issue.

Cut Straight to the News You Need

After MLex was acquired by LexisNexis in 2015, Hughes and the rest of the product/technical team set to work integrating MLex into the broader LexisNexis oeuvre; the last phase of which was to design a brand-new product to replace the legacy one.

As part of that process, MLex surveyed its users and incorporated much of the feedback received.

One of the biggest changes was to MLex’s email alert system. While the legacy product sent out large, general news blasts, today’s MLex email delivery function allows users to curate highly-personalized alerts based on filters such as (MLex) areas of interest, geography, sector or content type.

Users can also supplement their daily scheduled custom alerts with instant alerts (the full text of a story in one email) tied to individual matters, companies, law firms, and more.

When reading MLex coverage, users can gain further insight regarding the parties involved in a specific matter by accessing portfolios. Featuring full case timelines, lists of attorneys involved, and other categories, users can easily track the legal activities of larger entities and follow matters as they develop.

The customizable alert system allows attorneys to stay on top of legal happenings that are relevant to their specific practice area and client list.

Doing so also ensures subscribers will stay ahead of the competition when it comes to the latest relevant developments while potentially unlocking new business development opportunities.

Say you’re a partner at a law firm who has just received an instant alert for a new investigation targeting the shipping industry.

With that knowledge in your hands before it reaches the competition, “you can go, ‘Yeah, I know the head of shipping company X. Brilliant. Let’s call them up.’ Then within 15, 20 minutes, surprise surprise, you’ve got a new client or a new project,” Crofts says.

“In your day, you’ve got a certain heartbeat, a certain flow,” Hughes adds. “From a product perspective, we’ve got to help [MLex alerts] fall into that heartbeat… because that means you’re getting that super smart lens or that super quick lens through MLex content with all the noise removed.”

“We want to deliver news, but we’re also delivering information to people whose job it is to give legal advice – our news puts them in the best position to give that legal advice.”

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to Wells Fargo Legal Specialty Group’s most recent nine-month survey, how much is Biglaw productivity down this year compared with the average billable hours in 2018 and 2019?

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Hint: For the first nine months in 2018/19, Biglaw attorneys billed an average of 1,636 hours. This year, that number is down, and capacity “remains a challenge.”

See the answer on the next page.

# Another Boston-Based Firm Matches Cravath

One day after Ropes & Gray kicked off the Boston-based feeding frenzy, Goodwin Procter limped into a pay raise for its associates. Sure Goodwin has to publicly own the fact that it’s not the leader in its marketplace, but hey, “There’s No Shame In Finishing Second” was the motto of the Boston Red Sox for nearly 100 years, right?

Goodwin obnoxiously sent out its memo after 8 tonight. One can only assume these firms holding their announcements to the end of the day think they’re maximizing productivity by keeping the associate distractions until after official close of business. What they fail to understand is this coy maneuver isn’t helping because every minute they delay is just one more minute those associates spend furiously refreshing Above the Law.

In any event, here’s what Goodwin has to say:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

So the summers see the full advantage of the jump, but what’s up with the Class of ’08 and beyond? Hopefully everyone up there falls into a more favorable compensation bucket off this grid.

Oh and for the record, Goodwin’s U.S. offices include New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and D.C. No word on anyone in London, Frankfurt, or Hong Kong.

Congratulations to all.

It’s been about six months since law firms closed their office doors in favor of using work-from-home policies as a way to prevent employees from becoming infected with COVID-19, the deadly virus that’s plagued the globe for nearly all of 2020. Almost 6 million people in the U.S. have been infected with the coronavirus, and more than 180,000 people have died. Although cases continue to surge, many firms are pushing to reopen and get back to work in person.

Other firms are going another route entirely.

Back in March, Reed Smith — which raked in $1,246,926,000 in 2019 gross revenue, making it 26th on the Am Law 100 ranking — made waves as the first firm to institute a [mandatory work-from-home policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-institutes-mandatory-work-from-home-policy-to-protect-personnel-from-coronavirus/). The firm previously made four rounds of salary reductions for partners, associates, and staff, and fresh off reports that those [cuts would be reduced](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/billion-dollar-biglaw-firm-walks-back-its-pandemic-salary-cuts/) for almost all employees, Reed Smith is making news again.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
We’ve learned that Reed Smith will extend its work-from-home policy for all U.S. employees for at least the rest of the year and into the first month of 2021. Here’s a statement from the firm on its decision to remain remote for the next several months:

As the first law firm to move to remote working across our global platform, we are proud of the early action we took in March to protect the health and wellbeing of our personnel and our communities. We have now made a decision to extend our remote-work period for US personnel until at least January 2021. We hope this certainty will help our people as they make plans for the rest of the year.

In some US offices, under strict guidelines, lawyers can request to work from an office. In EMEA, some of our offices have partially returned to work, when safe and appropriate. More than 90% of Reed Smith lawyers and professional staff continue to log in remotely each work week. We are serving our clients well without skipping a beat and will continue to do that remotely into 2021 in light of the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic.

Reed Smith is the first firm we know of to announce that it will remain remote for the rest of 2020. Some may be sick of working from home, but for others, this decision offers a little security during these uncertain times in that employees won’t have to worry about potentially getting infected with COVID-19 while at work.

Will your law firm follow in Reed Smith’s footsteps? Please get in touch with us via email or text — [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or (646) 820-8477) — and let us know. This could be a brand new Biglaw trend in the making.

Hey look! It’s not a picture of cash. Now THAT’s a miracle.

Well, ask and you shall receive. Wow, multiple Biblical references before the first paragraph ends. All we need is Jones Day to pony up full raises and crack open the Seventh Seal, ushering in the End Times.

Whoa. We’ve gotten off track already. This is about raises and you people need to know who just jumped into the compensation game.

No sooner did we publish the increasingly flustered [gripes of Haynes and Boone associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/lets-hear-from-the-furious-associates-at-firms-that-havent-matched/) over their employer’s long silence on base salary increases (after becoming a [compensation leader last bonus season](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-new-compensation-leader-in-texas/)), than the firm came through big for its long-suffering (it’s been less than a month… medium-suffering at most) associates with [a full Cravath match](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/prodigal-law-firm-returns-to-cravath-scale/2/) — at least for most associates.

Haynes and Boone just matched the 2016 raises. We have a two-tier system, but those making “market” will have their pay raised effective July 1.

The memo indicates that associates in NY and D.C. are lockstep on the Cravath scale, running from $180K to $325K. All other domestic “HayBoo” associates are eligible for a Cravath match assuming performance requirements are met.

Associates in other offices will receive similar bumps based on performance (2000 billable hours seems to be the mark, at least in Dallas). Everyone in Dallas seems pretty happy and I think most are really grateful to the partners for the match, considering we already have it pretty good.

For the record, those offices include Austin, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Fort Worth, Houston, Orange County, Palo Alto, Richardson, and San Antonio. So far every tipster we’ve heard from, regardless of office, is at the appropriate place on the Cravath scale.

Look, we here at Above the Law don’t want to take credit for Haynes and Boone’s response this evening, but let’s face it — we’re totally and completely responsible for this.

You brought your petition to us, dear associates, and your prayers have, at long last, been answered.

Check out the [full memo on the next page…](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/prodigal-law-firm-returns-to-cravath-scale/2/)

So if and when your firm matches — or if you just want to lodge your complaint about your firm, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Back in September, Davis Polk really [raised the bar on special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/), offering associates up to $40,000 based on class year in recognition of their hard work throughout the pandemic. These bonuses weren’t consequential for Davis Polk associates alone — now almost all firms have adopted the Davis Polk special bonus, lest they be left in the dust when it comes to offering market compensation.

And now, the top 20 Am Law firm that brought about 2020’s bonus big boom has announced its year-end bonuses. Unsurprisingly, the firm has matched the prevailing market rate that was first announced by [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) and later echoed by [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/). Here’s the Davis Polk bonus scale for 2020:

Year-end bonuses at the firm will be paid on December 15. Congratulations to everyone at the firm on a great year. Davis Polk certainly have the thanks of almost every other associate across the Biglaw landscape for stuffing their bank accounts full of special bonus bucks during this nightmare of a year.

2020 is pretty damn scary. The global pandemic is ruining pretty much everything, and that includes the economy. Biglaw is reeling — [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/), [furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-furloughs-associates-firm-hopeful-they-can-return-to-work-soon/), and [salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/associates-facing-25-percent-pay-cut-at-am-law-200-firm/) are being announced with a disturbing frequency (if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Layoff Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post). Even at Biglaw firms that haven’t taken cost-cutting measures thus far, associates are looking over their shoulders, worried that their firm will be the next to announce cuts.

But at least one firm has taken the the time to reassure associates that the coronavirus economic upheaval will leave them unscathed. Yesterday, the Executive Committee at Cahill Gordon sent an email to all associates touting the firm’s storing financials, buoyed by “the strongest first quarter results in the Firm’s history.” And the email went on to let folks know not to expect cuts at Cahill:

There have been recent reports of some law firms taking steps to manage their expenses by reducing attorney salaries and furloughing lawyers. Please rest assured that the Firm is not considering any actions like this, We are extremely gratified by the efforts and cooperation of our attorneys during this difficult time. It’s great to see our lawyers step up to the challenge of working under these conditions. We are highly appreciative of all your efforts and we recognize ow fortune we are to have you as part of the firm.

Kudos to the firm for taking at least a little of the stress folks are feeling right now off the table.

[Good news everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRCzEqkCoiM)!

The financial game of Duck Duck Goose carries on, and Fenwick & West is the newest one to be it. And they can afford to play along, considering that they rake in bigly amounts of moolah — $543,079,000 gross revenue worth in 2020. No doubt made possible by their associates, who will be receiving the following compensation:



The monies will be reflected retroactively back to January 1st and will reflect on March 31st’s paycheck. Inflation may try us but Biglaw tries harder.

(Turn to the next page to see the Fenwick & West memo.)

We like hearing about salary increases almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”) or text us (646-820-8477).

# College Admissions Defendants Run To Biglaw For Representation
## Big guns arrive in college admissions case.

After allegedly blowing huge sums of money on a variety of scams to secure college berths for their less-than-spectacular children, the defendants in the wide-ranging college admissions scandal affectionately known as “Operation Varsity Blues” have begun to lawyer up and — as one might suspect given the bank accounts involved — [they’ve gone straight to Biglaw](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/03/18/lori-loughlin-and-felicity-huffman-hire-big-law-defenders-in-college-fraud-case-405-33610/?kw=Willkie%27s%20Caplan%20Looks%20to%20Big%20Law%20to%20Represent%20Him%20in%20College%20Admissions%20Case&utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_campaign=afternoonupdate&utm_content=20190318&utm_term=tal) according to American Lawyer.

By the way, why are we naming this affair after Varsity Blues? The only memorable thing about that movie is a kid telling his loser dad, “I don’t want your life.” But isn’t that the opposite of this scandal? Isn’t this a bunch of successful parents pulling strings to ensure their kids have exactly the same cushy life?

In any event, Biglaw’s own Gordon Caplan of Willkie Farr — whose [Caplan test prep plan was less successful than Kaplan’s](https://twitter.com/JosephPatrice/status/1105514680326459392) — has hired [Joshua Levy](https://www.ropesgray.com/en/biographies/l/joshua-s-levy) and [Michael McGovern](https://www.ropesgray.com/en/biographies/m/michael-g-mcgovern) of Ropes & Gray. Both were former AUSAs — as you’d expect in a case like this — and Levy served in the District of Massachusetts, the office leading this case. Unsurprisingly, the prosecutorial team [includes Ropes alumni](https://www.law.com/litigationdaily/2019/03/13/meet-the-big-law-alums-prosecuting-the-college-admissions-scandal-407-5372/). Caplan has also retained another former AUSA in [Patrick Smith](https://www.smithvillazor.com/person/patrick-j-smith/) of Smith Villazor.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Felicity Huffman went with Foley Hoag’s [Martin Murphy](https://foleyhoag.com/people/murphy-martin) out of the Boston office. Meanwhile, Aunt Becky is working with [BJ Trach](https://www.lw.com/people/bj-trach), [Sean Berkowitz](https://www.lw.com/people/sean-berkowitz), and [Perry Viscounty](https://www.lw.com/people/perry-viscounty) of Latham & Watkins — opting for a “coast-to-coast” strategy with the California-based Viscounty, Chicago’s Berkowitz, and Boston’s Trach. All of the lawyers have impressive résumés, ranging from Enron to Whitewater.

Still, it’s hard to imagine this is going to be much more than a negotiating job for these sterling attorneys. There’s not a ton of wiggle-room on those wiretaps and there isn’t anyone left to flip on with the supposed mastermind fulfilling the role of Cooperating Witness Number 1. It’ll be interesting to see if any one of the accused tries a Hail Mary effort or if everyone quietly tries to get their people off with as little fuss as possible.

# Classic Stealth Layoffs: Those 'Performance-Based' Layoffs At Cooley Hit High Billers, Too
## Not all the layoffs were based on performance after all.

Earlier this week, we reported on a [wave of stealth layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-junior-associates-top-20-biglaw-firm-cooley/) that took place at Cooley, a top 20 Biglaw firm that brought in $1,986,777,000 gross revenue in 2021. For its part, the firm couched its corporate layoffs in terms of performance, but new information has come to light that makes the firm’s claims even more questionable.

According to sources that spoke to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/10/cooleys-performance-based-layoffs-also-hit-high-achievers/), these layoffs weren’t based on poor performance — far from it. Here are more details:

While the firm characterized the layoffs as part of an annual midyear associate performance review process, a former Cooley associate who quit the firm during the layoffs disputed the firm’s justification. Three recruiters who have recently worked with Cooley associates confirmed that not all cuts were tied to performance issues, adding that some lawyers’ declining billables served as their only notice.

Rather, the associate said, falling demand in the firm’s venture capital and capital markets practices saw some associates billing under 40 hours per month by summer’s end, a problem magnified by Cooley’s zealous hiring in those practices last year.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As Biglaw firms know all too well by now, venture capital and capital markets practices have been severely affected by the economic downturn, and now associates are paying the price with their jobs. The anonymous associate who spoke to Am Law continued, stating, “They did lay people off, but not following a performance review. We had our performance reviews in January and February and no one was laid off. Everyone made it through the performance review and got bonuses as expected.”

Back in September, however, after things had just started to go south, the firm was said to have [implemented an associate hiring freeze](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/hiring-freezes-and-stealth-layoffs-hit-top-50-biglaw-firms/), but denied the official existence of such a program at the time. In light of the layoffs that have struck at the firm, the associate said of their former colleagues, “In the spring of 2022, I would not have thought the people who were going to get laid off had performance issues—they were billing high hours.”

# Biglaw Firm Unsurprisingly Declares Bankruptcy
## The firm's financial problems live on.

Sure, it’s possible to close a firm and [wind down operations](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/leclairryan-begins-the-process-of-dissolution/) sans a bankruptcy filing, but that was simply not in the cards for LeClairRyan. And since we already knew the firm was [having issues](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/problems-pile-on-for-struggling-biglaw-firm/) paying [monies owed,](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/biglaw-firm-prohibited-by-lender-from-returning-former-partners-capital-contributions/) well, it isn’t particularly surprising they went this route.

Yesterday, LeClairRyan filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Eastern District of Virginia. According to [the filing](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6379807-1c9ca87c-a1b6-4076-85b5-b537cf78ed1e.html), the firm has two secured creditors to which they owe almost $15 million — ULXP, which is the joint venture between the firm and alternative legal services provider UnitedLex as part of the attempt to start a “law firm 2.0” and ABL Alliance LLLP, the firm’s primary lender. In addition, LeClairRyan noted its unsecured creditors — more than 200 but fewer than 1,000 — were owed somewhere between $10 million and $50 million.

As [reported by ](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/09/03/leclairryan-files-for-bankruptcy-owes-15m-to-unitedlex-venture-lender/)Law.com, former LeClairRyan general counsel Lori Thompson is heading up the firm’s wind down activities and is busy reducing overhead:

Thompson’s declaration in support of the bankruptcy petition revealed that since the firm’s members voted to dissolve July 29, a move it confirmed to the public 10 days later, she and securities attorney Christopher Lange were the only two names left on the committee. Former CEO Erik Gustafson and former New Haven, Connecticut, office leader Richard “Deke” Bowerman have since stepped down.

Thompson said that between the dissolution vote and the Chapter 11 filing, LeClairRyan has taken steps to reduce its overhead, closing down operations at all of the 25 offices it once operated around the country, with the exception of fewer than 10 employees who are overseeing the firm’s wind down.

Though the move was not unexpected, it is not necessarily easy. As Leslie Corwin, partner at the boutique firm Eisner, told Law.com, things are bound to get messy:

“I’ve never seen these things go smoothly,” said Corwin, who has handled the bankruptcies of former legal luminaries Heller Ehrman and Testa, Hurwitz & Thibeault, and also represented now-defunct WolfBlock in its years-long, out-of-court liquidation process. “I think it’s hard on the former partners and staff of LeClairRyan. Their lives are going to be disrupted for a long period of time.”

It’s clear that though LeClairRyan may be gone, their legal (and financial) woes are far from over.

# Hackers Claim To Have Jones Day Files
## Ransomeware allegations strike again.

Just when Jones Day thought they could [slink out of the limelight](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/jones-day-to-prepare-for-a-bad-pr-campaign-the-likes-of-which-theyve-never-seen-before/) now that [the Lincoln Project is in disarray](https://thehill.com/homenews/news/538994-george-conway-calls-for-thorough-lincoln-project-probe-the-lying-has-to-stop) and their efforts to undermine election confidence with [deeply cynical challenges to absentee ballot security](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/) and [elevate the advocates behind child kidnapping](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/jones-day-hires-homeland-security-lawyer-doesnt-mention-kidnapped-immigrant-children-in-press-release/) might fade into the rearview mirror, the firm has a whole new public relations threat to worry about.

Databreaches.net first reported that [threat actors claim to have gotten their hands on Jones Day files in a ransomware attack](https://www.databreaches.net/threat-actors-claim-to-have-stolen-jones-day-files-law-firm-remains-quiet/). The good folks at Databreaches reached out to Jones Day but didn’t get a response about the attack or the data that’s already been publicly dumped on the dark web. But the hackers did:

Hi, they ignore us so they will be published.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Allegedly, the attack has exfiltrated 100 GB of files. So far they’ve only posted only relatively mundane material — cover letters and such — to prove that they aren’t lying. Perhaps that’s the extent of the breach and that’s why Jones Day is downplaying these allegations by ignoring them.

Still, it’s not a great look for a firm that [prides itself on its cybersecurity practice](https://www.jonesday.com/en/practices/cybersecurity-privacy--data-protection?tab=overview). While vacuuming up every remaining Trump administration collaborator, they should have nabbed [noted cybersecurity expert Rudy Giuliani](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/12/trump-names-rudy-giuliani-as-cybersecurity-adviser/)!

Ransomeware is an increasing problem for the profession as confidential material is getting nipped and exposing clients to damages ranging from embarrassment to trade secret theft. [Seyfarth was hit with a big attack last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/global-biglaw-firm-hit-by-aggressive-ransomware-attack/) and, to a certain extent, no firm is going to completely eliminate the risk as hacking constantly evolves. But it’s still a nightmare to be a firm caught with its pants down.

Thankfully, for Jones Day, this isn’t even the most embarrassing story about them in 2021.

UPDATE: Jones Day has a statement:

Jones Day has been informed that Accellion’s FTA file transfer platform, which is a platform that Jones Day—like many law firms, companies and organizations—used, was recently compromised and information taken.

Not everyone is buying this at face value. One anonymous tipster notes:

Simply isn’t accurate.

Accellion has two completely separate file transfer platforms; Accellion FTA and Kiteworks. Accellion FTA is a legacy product that Accellion guided clients to move away from in favor of Kiteworks, their newer flagship product starting in earnest back in 2017.

Many law firms weren’t using Accellion FTA. Many were using the Kiteworks platform by Accellion. A completely different codebase from FTA and not subject to the same vulnerabilities as FTA that resulted in both the Goodwin and Jones Day breaches. Accellion has previously stated that of its 3,000 total customers across multiple verticals – about 15% were using the legacy FTA software. Accellion only has 135 law firm customers. So even if you take 15% to apply to that small subset of customers, I don’t believe the characterization of “many” is accurate.

Meanwhile, Brett Callow, a professional cybersecurity threat analyst at Emsisoft points out:

Note that Clop didn’t necessarily carry out the attack on Accellion. They could simply have bought the data with the intention of using it to extort the company. At least one other group has done something similar in the past.

Whatever the case, there is obviously a significant risk that the data belonging to the other organizations affected by the Accellion breach will end up being published – and those other organizations include the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Washington State, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.

# Biglaw Firm Fires Partner After Investigation Into His Conduct
## Orrick is not the first firm to act swiftly in the face of allegations against a partner.

Pascal Agboyibor

Big news from Biglaw giant Orrick — they’ve asked a partner to leave the firm over reports of inappropriate behavior. Pascal Agboyibor, who joined the firm in 2002, was based in the firm’s Paris office and led their Africa practice as well as serving as a member of the board. According to a firm statement made to [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2019/03/11/orrick-ousts-practice-leader-to-uphold-our-values-and-culture/), he is now out of the firm:

“Pascal Agboyibor, of our Paris office, is no longer a partner at Orrick,” the firm said in a statement issued to The American Lawyer. “This is a decision taken by our board in order to uphold our values and culture, and is entirely unrelated to client work. To respect the request for privacy of a third party at Orrick, we cannot share any further details.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
According to reports, sources say that a “team member” complained of Agboyibor’s behavior in December. This triggered an independent investigation by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. That investigation reportedly found inappropriate behavior and lapses in judgment which led to his ouster, and Agboyibor’s last day at the firm was Friday.

Yves Lepage of the Paris office, will assume Agboyibor’s position as head of the firm’s Africa practice.

While details about the behavior that led to the removal of Agboyibor are unlikely to become public, it will still be read against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement. Orrick is [not the first firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-firm-fires-partner-after-sexual-harassment-investigation/) to act swiftly in the face of allegations against a partner. Hopefully the trend of valuing employees’ well being over a partner’s book of business continues.

# Biglaw Associate With ALS Is In Race Against Time To Find A Cure

You wake up one day in November of 2017 only to find that you’re having trouble holding a pen. You’ve also noticed some unfamiliar muscle movements in your arms. You’re only 37 years old, so you convince yourself that you must be really, really tired — exhausted, even.

After all, you’re an assistant U.S. attorney, and on top of all of your government work, you’ve got a one-year-old at home and another child on the way. Then come the hacking coughs, coughs so bad that your wife, newborn in tow, implores you to see a doctor. You do, and after a series of trips to doctors, you receive the most startling news of your life.

You might have ALS. You might have only six months left to live.

This is exactly what happened to [Brian Wallach](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/w/wallach-brian-s), an associate at Skadden Arps, and he says he was completely unprepared for the news. “Ice Bucket Challenge. Not good. Lou Gehrig,” were the first things that crossed his mind when a neurologist told him that he should prepare for an ALS diagnosis. In February 2018, his ALS diagnosis was confirmed. Just three months later, Wallach returned to Skadden Arps, the firm where he started his career, and he was welcomed back by the firm with open arms, despite his diagnosis. Although the average life expectancy for ALS is about two to five years, Wallach is doing more than simply tending to his own medical ailments. He and his wife, Sandra Abrevaya, recently launched [I Am ALS](https://iamals.org/), and they hope to raise $100 million of new funding to find a cure within three years.

The [Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-life-als-fundraising-obama-white-house-20181219-story.html) has a wonderful piece about Wallach’s fundraising efforts:

Starting last spring, Wallach flew around the country — to Boston, Seattle, New Orleans — meeting with organizations and researchers and doctors and patients and caregivers. He asked them how progress toward a cure could quicken. He asked, if you had an extra $1 million, what could you do?

He wanted to understand the landscape of this disease and its future, and he wanted to know how he could help. He and Abrevaya agreed that if they were to try to do something, it must not replicate what was already out there; it should efficiently, quickly bolster existing efforts.

“At the end of the day, this is a race,” Abrevaya said. “All we care about is what’s going on, why isn’t this working faster and better, and what is needed to help it work faster and better.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
According to a poll commissioned by Wallach and Abrevaya, more than 60 percent of Americans know little to nothing about ALS, and even more (85 percent) don’t know that the average lifespan of a person who has been diagnosed with ALS is less than five years. This is exactly what Wallach hopes he can change before his time is up.

“I think the word ‘hope’ is tossed around a lot. And if hope means that sort of naive belief that things are going to be OK, that’s not what I mean by hope. Hope means that you can actually have the power to help make your future better,” Wallach said. “Will it benefit me? Hopefully. But do I know it’s going to? Absolutely not. Do I hope I’ll be here to watch my daughters get married? Absolutely.”

# Trump Administration Warns Biglaw To Improve Diversity
## Does the Trump administration really care about diversity?

Of all the headlines I imaged I’d write over the course of the Trump presidency, this just isn’t one of them. But the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) director [Craig Leen](https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/about/CraigLeen.htm) told legal industry representatives at a town hall meeting that his office was concerned about issues of diversity and representation at law firms. Specifically, the following questions were posed by the government:

- How are firms addressing the low representation rates of women, minorities, and minority women at the partner levels?
- How do firms review their current level of people with disabilities?
- How do billable hours requirements accommodate family leave?
- How do firms ensure men and women are treated the same regarding family leave policies?
- How can OFCCP address concerns in disclosing information on equity and non-equity partnership numbers for women and minorities to OFCCP?
Those are some great questions, ones a lot of people are interested in hearing the answers to.

The OFCCP is part of the Department of Labor and tasked with ensuring federal government contractors and subcontractors do not discriminate in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national orientation, gender identity, disability, or veteran status. It has the ability to take enforcement actions and even sanction contractors it finds in noncompliance. Leen said his office is currently focusing on compliance in the legal industry, financial services industry, tech industry, and universities.

As for the[ thorny question](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/biglaw-partners-may-yet-be-people-employees/) of whether law firm partners are employees for the purposes of employment law, Leen made it clear those legal distinctions would not halt inquiries, as [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/10/government-warns-law-firms-of-consequences-for-diversity-failures/) Law.com:

When some law firm representatives pointed out during question-and-answer sessions that it is controversial whether law firm partners are employees subject to equal employment laws, Leen made it clear that the OFCCP regards associates as employees under its purview and that associate promotion rates to partner would be subject to OFCCP review. “We are going to be looking at that,” Leen said. “We are very keen on the issue of promotions.” He said the office would be issuing guidance soon.

Of course, as noted at the town hall, government contractor work isn’t a main source of income for many Biglaw firms, and as such, may not provide enough leverage to overhaul the industry. But it isn’t the only factor pushing the industry towards change. There are [numerous](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/mofo-files-for-sanctions-against-firm-plaintiff-suing-them-for-gender-discrimination/) lawsuits [against](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/jones-day-facing-second-class-action-lawsuit-over-fraternity-culture-of-the-firm/) Biglaw firms [alleging](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/) gender[ discrimination](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/biglaw-partner-alleges-sexism-derailed-her-career-in-a-new-lawsuit/), student[ activism agitating for change](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/law-school-students-are-taking-to-the-street-over-biglaw-firms-with-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/) in the industry, and good, old-fashioned[ PR concerns](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/these-biglaw-firms-are-officially-diversity-certified/) pushing firms in the right direction.

It’s certainly interesting to note that it is a retrograde Republican administration that is pushing for increased diversity — it doesn’t seem “on  brand” for Trumpland. So, is Leen a true believer in what the law says or is this an administration cudgel to cynically use diversity laws to punish law firms that they see as hotbeds of liberals? I’m not sure how much I care if the end result is meaningful diversity in the top rungs of the legal profession.

Excited to feast on some aggressively priced takeout lunch bowls?

Or would you rather say goodbye to all that and go remote for good? 

We want to know how you really feel about office reentry. Please take this anonymous, one-minute survey to help us find out.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

During slower periods, I feel constant pressure that I will be under my billable hour expectations, and it is difficult to relax and enjoy my free time. On the other hand, when I am billing enough hours to meet my annual requirement, the amount of work that I am doing makes it difficult to maintain relationships in my personal life.

— An anonymous DLA Piper associate, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/02/as-layoffs-loom-how-much-control-do-associates-have-over-low-billable-hours/) in its survey about what associates would change about the legal profession to benefit their mental health. Associates are increasingly worried about their billable hours as the threat of “performance-based” layoffs loom large across Biglaw.

# A 'Great Recruiting Year': Jones Day Nabs 9 Supreme Court Clerks
## The firm continues to win over Supreme Court clerks -- and two of them came from RBG herself.

It’s definitely still the case that we recruit across the Supreme Court. Any firm would be lucky to have one clerk. So I still consider that good news in the fact that we are still recruiting across the chambers. I can’t speak to what motivated other people to make the decisions that they made. I just think that at some level, the proof is in the numbers. We have nine, including two from what some would consider the more liberal justices.

— Traci Lovitt, leader of Jones Day’s issues and appeals practice, commenting on the [number of former Supreme Court clerks that the firm hired](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/08/jones-day-recruits-another-big-batch-of-supreme-court-law-clerks/) from the high court’s 2019-20 term. Included in the firm’s nine SCOTUS clerks are two former clerks from the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s chambers.

The sense of isolation and loneliness that many lawyers feel … that’s real. We need to be aware of that and look for ways to allow people to feel more supported … to make them feel more like part of a team instead of widgets in an office.

—Patrick Krill, founder of Krill Strategies, [talked to Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/05/28/battling-an-epidemic-of-loneliness-among-lawyers/) about the epidemic of loneliness and isolation among lawyers, as part of an ongoing series on mental health issues in the legal profession. The pressure for billables, the long hours and tedious tasks make for an unhealthy combination for many attorneys.

# One More Firm Matched
## This firm is on Santa's nice list.

As with [Weil Gotshal](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/one-more-bonus-match/), whose November match was never passed along to us here at Above the Law, it turns out that Covington & Burling also matched without anyone sharing. Thankfully eagle-eyed tipsters noticed both firms on our [naughty list](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/the-richest-firms-that-still-havent-announced-bonuses/) and dropped us a line. Still, the best service you can all do for your fellow attorneys at firms lagging behind is to report your own bonus immediately, allowing them to add pressure to their dilly-dallying firms.

So, anyway, we’re hearing now that Covington & Burling matched the Cravath scale last week. As a refresher, that’s…

2018 $15K prorated
2017 $15K
2016 $25K
2015 $50K
2014 $65K
2013 $80K
2012 $90K
2011 and earlier $100K

# Move Over Wachtell, There's A New Firm At The Top -- Vault Top 100 Firms (2017)
## There's a new most prestigious firm in town.

The big news from [last year’s vault Top 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/2016-vault-law-firm-rankings-self-perpetuating-prestige/?rf=1) rankings was that there was no big news. The rankings, particularly at the top, remained pretty much the same with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz claiming the top spot for the thirteenth year in a row. [But all that has changed](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/vault-law-100?pg=1), and there’s a new most prestigious firm in town: Cravath, Swaine & Moore.

[Vault notes](http://www.vault.com/blog/vaults-law-blog-legal-careers-and-industry-news/vaults-top-100-law-firms-for-2017/) that for close watchers of the rankings, it was only a matter of time until Cravath took over that number 1 ranking:

“Cravath has been nipping at Wachtell’s heels for the top spot for the last few years,” said Matt Moody, Vault’s Senior Law Editor. “Perhaps the recent slowdown in deal work is what pushed Cravath over the top. Although they are both very well regarded in M&A and litigation work, Cravath, which is roughly twice the size of Wachtell, has a slightly broader array of highly-ranked practice areas.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Or should we say re-took the number 1 ranking. Way back in 2003, before Wachtell began its epic run, Cravath held the top spot.

Though the survey closed in April, well before Cravath [announced its associate raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) and kicked off an industry-wide move to join the MoneyLaw club, Cravath’s influential move is likely to help perpetuate the firm’s prestige in the future. And despite epic bonuses, Wachtell still has not announced any change to its base salary scale, which may impact perceptions of the firm’s prestigiousness going forward.

There are other big changes to the top 10. Latham & Watkins moved up an impressive three slots to number 7. Gibson Dunn & Crutcher made it to the promised land of the top 10, while Weil Gotshal & Manges fell out of the top 10, now ranked at number 11.

Here are the top 10:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
1. Cravath, Swaine & Moore (+1)
2. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (-1)
3. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom (no change)
4. Sullivan & Cromwell (no change)
5. Davis Polk & Wardwell (no change)
6. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett (no change)
7. Latham & Watkins (+3)
8. Kirkland & Ellis (-1)
9. Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton (-1)
10. Gibson Dunn & Crutcher (+1)

There were also noteworthy moves outside of the Top 10. Boies, Schiller & Flexner fell 4 spots to 16. Dentons is ranked #68, which is a 12-spot climb from last year, which was, in turn, nine spots ahead of where it was the year before that, bringing it closer to the prestige levels once held by legacy firm Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal. Litigation boutique Susman Godfrey also made an impressive leap, going from unranked last year to 53 this year. Indeed, five firms are newly ranked this year, and five drop out of the rankings entirely.

Winners that entered the Top 100:
Susman Godfrey (53); Keker & Van Nest (90); Fox Rothschild (94); Littler Mendelson (96); and Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel (97)

Losers that dropped from the Top 100:
Dorsey & Whitney; Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton; Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner; Manatt, Phelps & Phillips; and Troutman Sanders

Congrats to all the firms that made the list; you’re the most prestigious in the land.

# The Price Of Joining A Firm That Doesn't Match Your Bonus
## This is another match... for most people.

Most of the bonus season follows form. A leader announces, most folks follow, some outlier goes over the top to garner a little press but no one follows, then Am Law 100 firms start coming in with bonuses that either outright don’t match or have some sneaky caveats designed to save firms a few bucks. Later payout dates, higher billable requirements… stuff like that.

As far as I know, we’ve gotten into the phase 3 bonus announcements. As the shorting goes its impact isn’t too extreme, but it’s unfortunate for those who will be caught in the crosshairs.

Dechert Price just announced its bonuses, and more or less they follow true to form.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012 and senior – $100,000

Associates will need to be in good standing with 1950 “bonus hours” which is a combination of billables, pro bono, firm-as-client work, and 25 hours of shadowing. Bonuses will be paid on January 23, 2020. The memo says January 23, 2019, but it’s doubtful that they possess a time machine.

Only Wachtell has one of those.

What’s missing from this matching list is, of course, the class of 2019. Most firms are granting the newcomers class appropriate bonuses prorated based on their start dates. Dechert is extending that offer too, but only to associates who joined between December 1, 2018 and July 1, 2019. In other words, all the first years who joined in the Fall of 2019 are getting nothing for their efforts.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
If you ascribe to the worldview that bonuses mean “bonuses” in Biglaw — [that bonuses are a purely discretionary perk to reward a year’s worth of effort](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/associates-dont-deserve-bonuses-argues-woman-who-isnt-an-associate/) — then this all makes sense. New associates didn’t work even half a year yet so they don’t deserve anything on top of the regular salary.

But bonuses aren’t “bonuses” in these firms. It’s an adjustable but a routine and expected component of an associate’s salary. To keep these associates paid in line with their peers at other firms, then they need to be paid what their peers are getting paid. It’s not a terrific amount of money… why skimp here?

In any event, congratulations to most of Dechert’s associates. For the newbies, better luck next year.

# This Biglaw Attorney Suffers From Depression And Wants Other Lawyers To Come Forward
## 'I felt scared. Ashamed. Crippled. As if I was going to die,' he writes. 'Perhaps most of all, I felt alone.'

Lawyers are more likely to suffer from depression than any other profession, but they often suffer in silence for fear of alerting their colleagues about their mental health disabilities and being stigmatized for the rest of their careers. One Biglaw counsel recently stepped out from behind the dark veil that is depression to let the world know that not only is it possible to survive with the disorder, it’s possible to thrive.

Meet [Mark Goldstein](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/professionals/g/goldstein-mark-s), counsel at Reed Smith. Goldstein recently published a piece in the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2019/02/12/scared-ashamed-crippled-how-one-lawyer-overcame-living-with-depression-in-big-law/) about his battle with depression. Goldstein was first diagnosed with severe depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety in September 2017. “I felt scared. Ashamed. Crippled. As if I was going to die,” he writes. “Perhaps most of all, I felt alone, particularly in a profession that often stigmatizes mental health disorders. A profession that tends to label them, instead, as ‘burnout,’ or sweep them under the rug.” It was Goldstein’s fear — fear of being labeled, fear of the stigma associated with mental health issues — that caused him to wait until he “simply could not function” at work anymore to tell the firm that he intended to take a leave of absence.

Much to Goldstein’s surprise, Reed Smith “was exceedingly supportive and conveyed a clear message: take all the time you need to recover.” After 11 weeks of recovery, reflection, and realization, Golstein returned to the firm, where he was “welcomed [] back with open arms.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Goldstein is now going public with his diagnosis because he has an important message to convey to all other attorneys with mental health issues of their own.

Speak up—and now. Forget about the perceived stigma surrounding mental health issues (and, yes, I know that’s easier said than done). There is literally nothing more important than your health and well-being. Be it a friend, family member, colleague, HR representative or someone else (feel free to make it me), you need to find at least one person in whom you can confide the gravity and extent of your struggles. You will not reach your professional goals—or, likely, your personal ones either for that matter—if you suffer in silence.

Contact a medical and/or mental health provider (some firms provide these services free-of-charge through employee assistance programs). Many mental health disabilities can be treated and contained through medication, therapy, a combination of both or some other means. A licensed professional will be able to work with you to determine the necessary approach based on your particular set of circumstances. …

Don’t assume that others are not sensitive to or understanding of your situation. Perhaps the most enlightening revelation of the past year, for me, has been discovering that other attorneys with whom I work, whom I respect, and who seem so poised and polished, are also suffering mental health issues and have sought/are seeking treatment for the same. As mental health has become a more acceptable topic of public discussion, I am glad to have seen other attorneys come out of the woodwork to share their personal journeys. Which leads me to my final point, and this is critically important: Remember that you are NOT alone.

Goldstein has some advice for attorneys everywhere who may be struggling with depression: although you may think it seems impossible, you must prioritize your health and your well-being over your work. You must take care of yourself, because you are more important than your cases, no matter how important those cases are.

Goldstein wants to eliminate the stigma associated with mental health disorders, and believes that if enough attorneys suffering with these issues band together, a meaningful support network can be created and to help others in their own recovery.

# Biglaw Business Development: 5 Insights From Chief Marketing Officers
## Some practical advice on generating new clients and new business, from top CMOs.

As we’ve discussed ad nauseam in these pages, demand for the services of Biglaw firms is [flat or declining](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/why-these-global-100-numbers-should-scare-the-bejeezus-out-of-you/). And this year promises [more of the same](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/2018-looks-like-another-year-of-blah-for-the-legal-industry/) on that front.

What does this mean for law firms? If the pie isn’t getting bigger, then growth must be achieved by grabbing a larger share of that pie — which is no easy feat. It’s [very difficult](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/07/nothing-you-can-say-can-cause-me-to-retain-you/) to displace a [competent incumbent](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/04/inside-straight-how-do-you-displace-a-competent-incumbent/) (as in-house columnist Mark Herrmann has noted repeatedly).

So the name of the game in 2018 is business development — getting new clients, or getting more business from existing clients. In light of the importance of “BD,” I wasn’t surprised to see a full house for an excellent panel at the Practising Law Institute (PLI) last Thursday, “Business Development Coaching from Chief Marketing Officers.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
(The panel was part of a great conference, [All Star Business Development for Lawyers](https://www.pli.edu/Content/Seminar/All_Star_Business_Development_for_Lawyers/_/N-4kZ1z0zxnc?fromsearch=false&ID=323958&t=BCV8_9AFAC), organized by [Deborah Brightman Farone](https://www.deborahfarone.com/biography), who [stepped down as CMO of Cravath](http://www.lawdragon.com/2017/09/05/legal-consultant-limelight-deborah-farone/) to start her own advisory firm, and [Katherine D’Urso](https://www.pli.edu/Content/Faculty/Katherine_DUrso/_/N-4oZ1z0zxm5?t=BCV8_9AFAC&ID=PE916684), chief client development officer at WilmerHale. I spoke on a different panel, “Reporting from the Press Box: The Interplay between Law and Journalism,” featuring Ashby Jones of the Wall Street Journal and Gina Passarella of the American Lawyer, with Katrina Dewey of Lawdragon as moderator.)

[Despina Kartson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/despinakartson), global director of business development and communications at Jones Day, moderated the CMO panel, which featured the following high-powered participants: [M. Ashraf Lakhani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashraflakhani/), director of business development and marketing at Porter Hedges LLP in Houston, as well as current president of the Legal Marketing Association (LMA); [David McClune](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-mcclune-7498334/), global chief marketing officer at Shearman & Sterling; and [Adam Stock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamstock/), chief information officer at [Allen Matkins](http://www.allenmatkins.com/Professionals/Stock-Adam/Biography.aspx) in San Francisco. Here are my five takeaways from the discussion.

1. It’s all about relationships.

Yes, technology is great (and we believe our [legal technology coverage](https://abovethelaw.com/technology/) here at Above the Law is some of the best in the business). But at the end of the day, even though law firms can and should use the tech tools at their disposal to improve the bottom line, business development in Biglaw remains relationship-driven.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The most important relationship, of course, is the one between lawyer and client (see item #2 below). But other relationships matter too.

First, CMOs need to have strong relationships with the lawyers at their firms — who are, at the end of the day, their clients. To be as effective as possible, the CMO needs strong support from firm leadership. Without such support, the CMO could encounter difficulty in [getting cooperation from lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/alt-legal-the-biglaw-caste-system-an-impediment-to-innovation/).

Second, at larger firms with sizable business development and marketing departments, the CMO needs to provide support for her own team members. As firms get serious about business development and continue to grow their BD departments, which now might include experts in everything from customer-relationship management to pricing to social media, the CMO needs to manage as well as market.

2. Know your clients — and know their industry.

Yes, truly [listening to your clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/to-be-a-good-litigator-you-must-be-a-good-counselor-and-therapist/) is critical — but you knew that already.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
What was somewhat more novel from the panelists was the observation that clients are increasingly seeking lawyers who don’t just have legal knowledge — how to draft a merger agreement, how to [try a case](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/how-litigators-evade-the-question-of-trial-experience/) — but who also have deep industry knowledge. Clients don’t want their lawyers to have to get up to speed on how their sector works (and certainly don’t want to pay for it). When a lawyer enters a pitch meeting, the client will want that lawyer to know her business inside out.

As a result, many firms now conduct business development at an industry level. They’re figuring out the half-dozen or so industries that generate the bulk of their work, and they’re presenting themselves as experts in those sectors. Traditionalists might scoff at such an approach — “I’m a litigator, I can handle any case you put in front of me” — but the generalist is rapidly becoming an endangered species.

Maybe certain famous lawyers with international reputations or certain white-shoe law firms with institutional clients can still get work from across the spectrum. But for most lawyers and law firms, even partners and even Am Law 100 firms, clients increasingly want and expect industry expertise.

So figure out what you excel at (as a lawyer and as a firm), emphasize those strengths (in practice areas and in industries), and de-emphasize the rest.

3. View business development broadly.

Many lawyers view BD in too narrow a fashion. They’re too focused on themselves or maybe their group, not on the broader firm or legal market. While specialization is important, as just discussed, lawyers and law firms must also see the big picture.

CMOs can also make this mistake, seeing their job as little more than helping out on pitchbooks. A great CMO needs to understand the firm’s long-term strategy — and hopefully the CMO has been involved in formulating that strategy.

This requires the CMO to have knowledge about a broad range of subjects beyond just marketing — for example, the firm’s business plan, its approach to pricing, and the industries it’s focused on.  It also might explain why the caliber of professionals in law firm marketing and business development is increasing, with many CMOs having degrees like JDs or MBAs.

4. Embrace the opportunities of social media.

Business development typically involves a one-on-one relationship (think of a lawyer pitching to a prospective client), while marketing typically involves a one-to-many relationship (think of using media coverage to establish one’s expertise in a field). Social media is powerful because it offers a lawyer the opportunity to do both marketing and business development — provided that the lawyer seizes the opportunity.

Niche practices lend themselves especially well to social media. By blogging and tweeting about a specific topic, a lawyer can establish herself as an expert in a particular area of law (e.g., [marijuana law](https://abovethelaw.com/author/hbricken/) or [assisted reproductive technology (ART) law](https://abovethelaw.com/author/ellentrachman/)). The opportunity to [build a practice in a niche area](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/power-niche-marketing-turning-your-niche-into-a-power-niche-augmenting-your-power/) is stronger than ever (as our marketing columnist, managing partner [Bruce Stachenfeld](https://abovethelaw.com/author/brucestachenfeld/), has stressed).

As a result, law firms are getting over their aversion to social media. Shearman & Sterling, for example, has two full-time employees who oversee its social-media efforts. The firm and its lawyers are active on LinkedIn, where around 90 percent of its attorneys have profiles, as well as Twitter and even YouTube. For a major international law firm like Shearman & Sterling, it might be hard to generate clients through social media, but the firm sees it as an important investment in overall brand building.

5. The media matters.

In the olden days, it was much easier for a law firm to ignore the media, responding to every inquiry with “no comment.” Those days are over. Given the proliferation of outlets and the relentless, 24/7 news cycle, lawyers ignore the media at their peril.

Yes, some clients don’t want their cases or matters in the media — and if that’s the case, then the firm should aid in the effort. But in certain situations, involving major clients with major matters, media coverage is inevitable. In that scenario, the lawyers on the matter should work closely with business development and marketing professionals, at the firm and even at the client if necessary, to shape the narrative.

Some firms, especially larger firms, find it helpful to have a centralized and coordinated media strategy. Otherwise, the firm runs the risk of a lawyer saying or writing something in the media that’s adverse to a client’s interest — and that might even get used against that client. This is why firms sometimes kill client alerts on new developments in an area of law. Generally such client memos are helpful at showcasing the firm’s expertise (see, e.g., [Wachtell Lipton](https://biglawbusiness.com/when-the-wachtell-memo-strikes/)), but in some situations it’s too fraught with peril.

Finally, marketing professionals should encourage their lawyers to develop relationships with journalists. Even just talking “on background” with a reporter — not for attribution, just helping the journalist understand a complex legal issue — can generate goodwill. That goodwill could come in handy down the road, when the lawyer is hoping to be quoted on breaking news, or when the firm finds itself in an unwelcome spotlight.

**********

In this highly competitive market for legal services, marketing and business development are more important — and more complicated and challenging — than ever. There’s a reason why chief marketing officers have the [shortest average tenure](https://www.wsj.com/articles/average-tenure-of-cmo-continues-to-decline-1489777765) of any C-suite executive, and why the comings and goings of Biglaw CMOs sometimes feel like Game of Thrones.

But on the positive side, a talented chief marketing officer is more valuable than ever. As reflected in their [robust](http://blog.larrybodine.com/2011/07/articles/current-affairs/average-bigcity-law-firm-cmo-salary-is-386294/) pay [packages](https://www.legalwatercoolerblog.com/2010/10/15/can-i-get-a-side-order-of-work-life-balance-with-that-job-please/), great Biglaw CMOs are worth their weight in gold.

We’ve made it through another year. Well, almost. We probably shouldn’t start counting our bats and pangolins before they’ve hatched. Joe and Kathryn look back at the wild ride of 2021 and make some predictions about what 2022 holds. Also… it’s that time of year to send in your Lawyer of the Year nominations.

# A Day In The Life Of A High-Powered Biglaw Mom At An Elite Firm
## Can you keep up with this super mom? Probably not.

Are you an attorney who thinks your day is especially difficult? If you don’t have children, you may want to think again.

Being a high-powered lawyer at an elite firm can be quite complicated, and when you add children to the mix, it can become an acutely distressing experience. Now, imagine being the co-chair of not one, but two practice groups, and add in a husband who’s also a partner at another elite law firm. How on earth can you manage your days, much less your home life?

[Deneen Howell](https://www.wc.com/Profiles/Deneen-C-Howell), co-chair of the employment counseling and litigation and transactions and business counseling practice groups at Williams & Connolly, has gotten all of this down to an art. Her husband, [Donald Vieira](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/v/vieira-donald-l), is a partner at Skadden, and her two children, Jasper and Vivian, have two goldfish. She describes her workday juggle in a recent article published in the [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/sites/nationallawjournal/2018/02/06/with-the-three-rs-heres-how-williams-connollys-deneen-howell-powers-through-her-day/). Here’s a maddening little excerpt from Howell’s day, which starts at about 5:45 a.m., every day:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Pushups and Planks  I set an alarm on my phone and I usually get up between 5:45 and 6. First thing I do is check my phone and see if any emails have come in from the night before that might make me need to shift my to-do list. Right now what I’m doing is a workout challenge. It’s a series of pushups and planks, so I do that. Then I have my debate about whether I wake up the kids first or I take a shower first. They could always benefit with a little more sleep but I feel like as a family we can benefit with a little more time spent getting ready. …

Dual Calendars  Other than the first email check-in, I’m not working again until I get to my desk usually at about 9. I check emails again to see what came in between 6 or so and 9. I’ll see whether that changes the way I run my day. I have a month-at-a-glance spiral paper calendar that I usually carry with me everywhere. Then I have the Outlook calendar on my phone. I try to have the same appointments in each. I make sure those things match up, and I’ll think about what are my pockets of time between calls and meetings. During those times, I’m reviewing contracts, editing, talking to colleagues. …

Checking In  After the kids are in bed, I’m almost always checking email just to see if anything I might have been working on got moved forward in any way that I need to keep up with before the next morning. A handful of nights a month, sometimes more concentrated than that, I’ve scheduled calls. I’ll get back on the phone at 9 o’clock or 10 o’clock depending on the time zone involved. On nights when I don’t have scheduled calls, it’s usually just status checking, and I might respond to an email or two and reset my priorities for the next day, depending.

Howell gets through it all by using the three R’s: being realistic, responsive, and relatable. “I’m realistic with my clients in helping them manage expectations about me. With my kids, I’m realistic about what they can expect from their mom,” she says. “With being responsive, I try to meet their needs, whether it’s clients or my kids as best I can. For relatable, I really want my clients to know and understand me and for me to know and understand them, so that I can meet their needs.”

If you’re feeling overwhelmed with your work at your firm, perhaps take a cue from Deneen Howell on how to get your act together and keep it that way. Because she’s so efficient, she’s not just a super lawyer, she’s also a super mom. Congratulations!

# The 100 Largest Law Firms In New York (2020)
## Size matters for law firms in the Big Apple.

There are many different and exciting ways to rank law firms. How prestigious are they? How much money are they making? How much take-home cash do partners earn? How big are they?

Yes, size matters, especially during these crazy COVID times. Amid furloughs and layoffs — acknowledged and stealth — firms could still be cutting associates while putting up big head count numbers.

The New York Law Journal recently unleashed its annual NYLJ 100, a ranking of largest law firms in New York covering the previous calendar year. As luck would have it, many Biglaw firms increased their New York City head counts [by more than 10 percent](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/07/13/big-firm-offices-in-new-york-ballooned-before-2020-cost-cutting-started/) in 2019, and now here we are, facing down austerity measures due to a pandemic. If you’ve ever wondered about head counts, this is the ranking for you.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The NYLJ 100 ranks the 100 largest firms by number of lawyers in the state of New York. All private law offices in the state are considered … irrespective of where the firm is headquartered or where it claims a home office. Non-U.S.-based law firms are considered equally with domestic U.S. firms; the sole criterion for inclusion in the NYLJ 100 is the size of a firm’s New York state presence.

The top 15 biggest firms (numbers show attorneys in New York) are not surprising. Let’s take a moment to gawk at Manhattan’s Biglaw behemoths:

1. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison: 832
2. Davis Polk & Wardwell: 700
3. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom: 656
4. Kirkland & Ellis: 646
5. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett: 601
6. Weil, Gotshal & Manges: 563
7. Sullivan & Cromwell: 543
8. Cravath, Swaine & Moore: 496
8. Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton: 496
9. Debevoise & Plimpton: 481
10. Latham & Watkins: 480
11. White & Case: 433
12. Sidley Austin: 429
13. Milbank: 425
14. Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson: 381
15. Willkie Farr & Gallagher: 380

Congratulations to Paul Weiss for employing more lawyers in New York than any other firm. This firm wins the award for putting the “big” in Biglaw in the Big Apple.

Ready for more news of Biglaw financial austerity? No? Too bad! Firms are trying to keep apace with all of the economic upheaval, and that increasingly means (smaller) cost-cutting measures now to ensure they can avoid calamitous results later.

At Am Law 200 firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, they’ve taken cost-cutting to employees’ paychecks. The firm has confirmed to Above the Law that they’ve “temporarily adjusted compensation across all levels.” Though the firm has been quiet on exactly how large the pay cuts are, tipsters at the firm report they’ve cut associate salaries by 5 percent and partners are taking an undisclosed but reduced share.

Joseph A. Dougherty, CEO & Managing Director at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, had this to say about the austerity measures:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Buchanan, like many businesses coping with challenges posed by COVID-19, is taking preemptive and responsible measures consistent with providing to clients the highest level of quality and service they expect. We have temporarily adjusted compensation across all levels.”

Let’s hope these rather modest austerity measures pay off and the firm can avoid layoffs or other, more severe measures.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Federal Court Does Its Part To Let Associates Go Home Before Midnight
## Just common sense.

Nothing will permanently free lawyers from bleary-eyed late nights cramming to get a filing stamped before a deadline, but the Third Circuit Court of Appeals is doing its part to get folks home a little early. Chief Judge Michael Chagares has long championed a more humane approach to lawyering across the country and now he’s put in a bid to make it a reality for his court.

A proposed amendment to the Third Circuit’s Local Rules would roll back the current 11:59:59 p.m. deadline for timely filings to 5:00 p.m. when the court clerk’s office closes. Enough time to go home, sit back… and start billing on another matter.

Still, it’s better than nothing.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
More cynical observers suggest that this is an empty gesture that just pushes back the late-night work to the evening before. But the thing about lawyers is they were going to work the whole night anyway. All that’s being cut off is the neurotic final throes where the partner fiddles with the brief between 5 and midnight before ultimately deciding to go with the original version everyone approved at 4:30.

Another concern about the move is the risk of a patchwork series of rules. [From Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/federal-appeals-court-proposes-rolling-back-midnight-e-filing-deadline-2023-01-17/):

Public comment is due by Feb. 18. On Twitter, reaction was mixed, with some lawyers complaining it was unnecessary and could create confusion by adopting an earlier deadline in one circuit than the rest of the federal appellate courts.

“If this is across the board, it would be great,” Richard Heppner, an assistant law professor at Duquesne University, said in an interview. “But there’s a real trap for the unwary practitioner.”

But isn’t that true of all Local Rules? This isn’t appreciably different than the days when courts demanded an arbitrary number of courtesy copies to count as properly filed. We all survived. It only takes about 5 minutes out of your day to skim the Local Rules and make sure you’re not doing anything stupid. That’s billed time well spent.

So, we are mid-March madness… is your bracket busted? With Villanova, Duke, and Florida State losing, there’s nary a perfect bracket in the country. But fret not! You can still get in on the madness with Above the Law’s Biglaw Lawyers Behaving Badly Bracket. The [first half](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/who-is-the-worst-behaved-former-biglaw-attorney/?rf=1) of the Sweet Sixteen matchups have concluded, so now we can move on to the Elite Eight in the Al Capone and Do Your Job regions. ([Voting is still open](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/who-is-the-worst-behaved-former-biglaw-attorney-part-2/) until March 22nd at 6:00 a.m. in the Sweet Sixteen voting for the Infamous and Impulse Control regions.)

So, without further ado, here is where our bracket currently stands:

Yes, we are on a first name basis with these ne’er-do-wells. On to the voting!


#1 Seed Keila Ravelo v. #2 Seed John O’Brien

The Biglaw partner who’s[ accused of running a litigation vendor scam](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/partner-allegedly-steals-millions-from-biglaw-firms-to-lead-luxurious-lifestyle/) that allegedly netted her and her husband nearly $8 million in embezzled fees easily won her opening matchup. But now Keila Ravelo has to take on someone who was sentenced to two years of jail time for his misdeeds.

John O’Brien [was punished](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/08/ex-sullivan-cromwell-partner-accused-of-failing-to-pay-taxes-on-millions-in-income/) for not filing taxes on $9.2 million in partnership income. I can easily see how a little thing like $9.2 million can just fall through the cracks… oh, wait. No, I can’t.

#4 Seed Jeffrey Wertkin v. #2 Seed Carlos Spinelli-Noseda

Upset alert: on this side of the bracket we have a #4 seed who took out a former Biglaw associate serving 12 (!) years in prison for [insider trading](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/lawyer-of-the-day-a-former-associate-from-three-top-firms-charged-in-a-32-million-insider-trading-case/). But that 4 seed, Jeffrey Wertkin, does have the benefit of recency, and, you know, he was [wearing a wig](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/akin-gump-lawyer-arrested-trying-to-sell-the-details-of-a-whistleblower-complaint/?rf=1) when he got arrested for selling a whistleblower complaint. So, you know, not the best look for a Biglaw partner.

Wertkin faces off against #2 seed Carlos Spinelli-Noseda. Spinelli-Noseda is the former Sullivan & Cromwell partner who simply could not get his reimbursements correct… [to the tune of $500,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/09/former-sullivan-cromwell-partner-resigns-for-defrauding-clients-and-the-firm-to-the-tune-of-500k/).

# Shearman & Sterling Rolls Out COVID-19 Austerity Measures
## If you want a break from Biglaw, here's your chance.

Before they go crazy with the COVID-19 austerity measures we’ve seen a lot of across Biglaw — the [salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/k-l-gates-cuts/), [furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-announces-attorney-layoffs-and-furloughs/), and [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/norton-rose-fulbright-lays-off-associates-cuts-salaries-amid-covid-19-upheaval/), oh my! — Shearman & Sterling has decided to ask the class for volunteers. That’s right, according to [Roll on Friday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-shearman-sterling-offers-lawyers-huge-holidays-30-pay), they’re offering associates the opportunity to do an extended vacation.

Shearman has launched a “voluntary leave program” that allows attorneys at the firm to take a minimum of three months and a maximum of six months sabbatical at 30 percent of their current salary. Plus, if attorneys decide to do pro bono work during their time off, their salary may be “topped up to 40%.”

But will anyone take the offer? That remains to be seen. But given the competitive environment at the firm, one insider quipped, “It would be exceptionally surprising if anyone volunteers for this at all.”
