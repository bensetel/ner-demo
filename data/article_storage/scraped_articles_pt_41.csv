# Average Attorney Salary Might Surprise New Lawyers (And Judges’ Average Earnings Are Even Lower)
## Around a quarter of us are drowning financially. As a profession, we should browbeat anyone even considering going to law school with that fact.

I gave a little presentation to my local bar association a couple weeks ago. Among other things, I talked about attorney salaries and how they differ regionally, and I sifted through a lot of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Turns out the BLS gathers a lot of helpful information about lawyers.

Really, it’s not all bad news. The [BLS estimated mean annual wage for lawyers](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes231011.htm#(3)) is a respectable $144,230. While $144,230 a year doesn’t even scratch the bottom of [the Milbank/Simpson/Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/70-percent-of-biglaw-firms-are-not-on-board-with-190k-for-first-year-associates/), this is a national average. In most parts of the country, an annual salary of $144,230 is more than enough to live a comfortable life and have a reasonable shot at paying off your student loan debt.

Of course, like a lot of averages, this one is inflated by the top end of the market. The median annual wage for lawyers, $120,910, is substantially lower than their mean annual wage. At the 75th percentile for salary, lawyers are making $182,490 annually — meaning that anyone starting out on the Cravath scale is earning, in the first year, more than three out of every four of their colleagues nationwide. But at the 25th percentile, lawyers are only making $79,160 a year. Those at the 10th percentile are pulling in an annual salary of just $58,220.

That’s a bit of a problem for those at the lower end of the spectrum. [U.S. News puts the average debt load of a J.D. student](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/the-short-list-grad-school/articles/most-expensive-law-schools) who graduated from a private school in 2018 at $123,511 (we know the real average is probably a bit higher, considering that [the U.S. News debt data leaves out some schools where student debt loads are likely to be higher than average](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/why-cant-anyone-give-us-a-straight-answer-about-average-law-school-student-loan-debt/)). Students who got a J.D. from a public school reportedly carried a slightly more manageable average debt of $86,747 at graduation, according to U.S. News. The [interest rates on federal student loans](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/interest-rates) range from just over 4.5 percent to a smidge above 7 percent. The lowest interest rate is for undergraduate loans; the best interest rate you can hope to get right now for graduate or professional federal student loans is a hair over 6 percent. Even at 6 percent, a new lawyer with the average debt load from a private law school is accumulating $7,410.66 per year in extra debt from interest alone. A lawyer at the 25th percentile for salary, after paying taxes, would have to set aside more than 10 percent of his or her income just to tread water and make the interest payments.

Now, you might say that the relatively measly salaries are only for recent graduates, and that as an attorney builds a practice and progresses in his or her career, the salary will increase accordingly. That is surely true, to an extent, and BLS does not break down its salary data by age or years of practice to give us a more complete picture of the work experience factor. However, BLS does have a separate occupational category for “Judges, Magistrate Judges, and Magistrates,” and folks in the judicial branch seem to be making, on average, even less than the attorneys appearing before them (which I don’t think is a surprise to any litigators).

[The mean annual wage for judges is $121,130](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes231023.htm). This doesn’t include [administrative law judges, who have their own BLS category](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes231021.htm) and their own even lower average salary. In my home jurisdiction, although I don’t think it’s written down anywhere as an actual rule, the conventional wisdom is that one need not even apply for a judicial position without at least 10 years of prior substantive practice experience. To become a judge, one must apparently have a core dedication to public service, a wealthy family, or, in very recent history, [a pathological compulsion to shamelessly promote far-right ideology](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-picks-more-not-qualified-judges-1).

Attorneys and judges are, on average, doing alright after having clawed their way through seven years of post-secondary education, even within a legal job market that has resembled a World War I battlefield for most of the past decade. Still, around a quarter of us are drowning financially. As a profession, we should browbeat anyone even considering going to law school with that fact. And maybe those of us who are doing fine loan-wise should also keep it in mind when the urge to get snippy with opposing counsel inevitably bubbles up.

In the fast-paced legal world, finding time for pro bono work can be challenging, but the benefits are well worth it. The need for pro bono services is great, and those who lend their expertise free of charge to serve the greater good often find the work rewarding and satisfying, both professionally and personally.

In fact, it’s for these reasons that pro bono hours have been on the rise in the past several years. According to a recent study, overall pro bono hours have been on a steady climb, with 4.2 million hours in 2015 rising to 5.45 million hours in 2020​​. In 2022, the AmLaw 200 firms contributed about 5.01 million hours of pro bono work, a slight decrease from the 5.45 million hours in 2020 but an increase from 2021​​. This trend underscores the importance of pro bono work, and below we discuss in detail exactly why providing pro bono services can enhance one’s professional and personal development while also serving those in need.

Pro Bono Work: It Makes Us Happy
There is a Chinese saying: “If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap. If you want happiness for a day, go fishing. If you want happiness for a year, inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime, help somebody.” Throughout history, the greatest thinkers have suggested that happiness is found in helping others. This notion is supported by scientific research, including a study by Titova and Sheldon (2021) in The Journal of Positive Psychology, which found that efforts to make others happy can increase personal happiness more than focusing on oneself​​​​​​. Helping others may be the key to living a life that is not only happier but also healthier, wealthier, more productive, and meaningful.

Expanding Legal Expertise Through Pro Bono
Beyond serving the greater good, pro bono work is an opportunity for lawyers to diversify their experience and improve their skill set. It also gives lawyers the chance to pursue an area of law they are passionate about. Doing so will not only make you a more well-rounded attorney, but it will also better serve your existing clients by having an understanding of different types of matters and the different walks of life they come from. What’s more, pro bono work often gives younger attorneys more hands-on experience than their primary (paying) practice. For example, a litigator who has never argued in the courtroom or a corporate lawyer who has never directly drafted or negotiated contracts can take on pro bono cases to gain practical, first-hand experience. These experiences are crucial for skill development, especially for lawyers early on in their careers.

Networking and Team Building
Pro bono work is an effective strategy for building stronger bonds with colleagues and for broadening professional networks. Collaborating with colleagues from other practice areas/departments on pro bono matters can forge new relationships and strengthen camaraderie within an organization. Pro bono work can also connect lawyers from different organizations, expanding one’s professional network, which can prove invaluable for career development down the road.

Enhancing Brand Recognition, Law Firm Culture and Recruitment
Many lawyers today tell me they are looking for employers that prioritize corporate responsibility – which is the notion that a firm makes a concerted effort to operate in ways that enhance rather than degrade society and the environment. Pro bono work is one of the prime ways firms can achieve this. In fact, when evaluating law firms and attorneys to hire as outside counsel, many clients look favorably at those who have actionable social responsibility initiatives in place.

Leadership and Pro Bono
Strong pro bono involvement often leads to leadership opportunities. This is evident in the growing number of dedicated pro bono partner roles in law firms globally. As reported by the International Bar Association, there are now 66 examples of dedicated pro bono partner roles across 55 law firms worldwide​.

The nature of pro bono work has evolved significantly over the last decade, with pro bono practices expanding in size and complexity, often operating across multiple jurisdictions and connected to humanitarian emergencies. This growth in pro bono partner roles reflects these trends and provides another avenue for leadership opportunities within firms​​.

Elevate Your Legal Career with Pro Bono Insights
In sum, providing pro bono services is not just the right thing to do, but it’s also the smart thing to do – for your career, your community, and your happiness. To truly excel in this profession, strategic choices are crucial.

This is one of the only countries where we can be who we are and still belong to American society. My “work” ridas are mostly blues and greys.

Obviously, we’re in a politically charged time. We have an American presidential candidate running on a platform of explicit bias, and there’s a misconception about women who wear hijab. I want to help people be more culturally competent, to create a dialogue.

— [Fatema Merchant](http://www.sheppardmullin.com/fmerchant), a senior associate at [Sheppard Mullin](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/sheppard-mullin/), explaining some of the reasons [why she wears a hijab to work](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/06/29/why-a-big-law-associate-chooses-to-wear-muslim-hijab/). Merchant says she does not know any other Muslim woman in Biglaw who chooses to wear a hijab to the office.

# Engaging With A Legal Recruiter: Key Insights To Become A Priority Candidate
## Discover how to make a compelling impression on legal recruiters and become a top-priority candidate in your job search.

Initiating your job search might start with a conversation with a legal recruiter. After all, your inbox is likely filled with messages from recruiters hoping to get you on the phone. This initial conversation will direct the trajectory of your search. While a simple conversation may not seem like an important milestone, the quality of your initial conversation with a recruiter can significantly influence the outcome of your search. This article will describe how you can maximize this crucial interaction to get the best results and also explain how you can position yourself to become a priority candidate.

Understanding Your Motivations and Circumstances
First, legal recruiters want to know why you are job searching or why you may be open to new opportunities. Your motivations for seeking a new opportunity provide much-needed context to your search. Future employers crave this insight to help understand how their firm can best support you and your needs.

To position yourself as a high-priority candidate, explain your pain points at your current firm and describe issues that could be improved with a lateral move or a new firm. Don’t hold back – it helps to be as honest as possible. A skilled legal recruiter will frame your reason in the best light, which will help future employers understand why you are considering a lateral move.

The second reason that understanding your motivations and circumstances is so important is because it allows your recruiter to direct you to a firm that excels in your current pain point. This will ensure that you are matched with a firm that solves your problems resulting in a meaningful career move.

In sum, articulating why you’re looking to make a move and what you wish to improve from your current situation enables us to more accurately identify positions that not only align with your career objectives but also enhance your professional satisfaction.

Timeline Considerations
Timing is everything – especially when it comes to your job search. Life events and professional milestones can greatly impact the timing of your career move. On the personal side, maybe you have a vacation planned or are expecting a baby. On the professional side, perhaps you expect an upcoming bonus payment or maybe you have recently been informed of layoffs. To become a high-priority candidate, share your personal and professional timeline and let your recruiter know when you would ideally like to make a move. Sharing these details ensures that a transition is seamless and timely.

Highlighting Your Achievements
Your skills and accomplishments paint a picture of your professional capabilities. To position yourself as a priority candidate, tell us your achievements and what you are proud of so that we understand how capable and advanced you are. This information is crucial for us to advocate on your behalf effectively and also connect you to opportunities that value your specific skill set.

Rationale Behind Career Moves
Understanding the reasons behind your previous transitions provides valuable context to potential employers. Employers are extremely interested in why you moved from one firm to another. This helps them understand how your moves served to advance your career.

To position yourself as a high-priority candidate, explain the reason behind each transition to your recruiter. This insight helps us better understand your career as a whole and how a new opportunity can complete the picture. If the reasons behind your moves are logical, we are well-positioned to present you as a candidate with a clear, strategic career path, enhancing your attractiveness to prospective firms. If the reasons behind your moves were less strategic, we can help you frame the reasons in a way that paints a logical picture. Sharing this information will help your recruiter tell your story in a way that provides valuable context to your career.

Salary and Compensation Expectations
Don’t be shy about money. It’s an important factor in your job search and may be one of the driving forces in your search. An open dialogue about your compensation expectation is essential for matching you with appropriate opportunities. It also ensures that the roles we focus on align with your professional worth and financial goals. To position yourself as a priority candidate, share your target salary with your recruiter. An informed recruiter will explain whether your target is appropriate for the market.

Your Academic Credentials
Your educational background and significant academic achievements are key factors in the recruitment process. Law firms care about your law school GPA and class rank. This often times holds true regardless of how long ago you graduated from law school. To position yourself as a priority candidate, know your GPA and class rank. This academic information guides us to opportunities where your specific qualifications are valued and respected.

Who You Are Beyond the Resume
Now that we’ve spoken about your motivations, circumstances, timelines, achievements, career moves, salary expectations, and academic credentials, we want to experience your personality and understand who you are outside of the office. Getting to know you on a personal level enables us to find a firm culture that fits you and career aspirations. This holistic approach to recruitment is central to ensuring not just a job placement, but a fulfilling career move.

At [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/), our mission is to facilitate meaningful career transitions by leveraging our industry insight, extensive network, and a personalized approach to recruitment. By partnering with us, you gain an advocate dedicated to positioning you for success in the dynamic legal landscape.

If you’re a lawyer and you ever find yourself in a position to be arrested, it’s best not to demand of the police officer whether he or she knows who you are (and for what it’s worth, proper etiquette also dictates that you not [tell the officer to Google you](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/01/lawyer-of-the-day-alleged-death-threats-put-attorney-on-ice/)).

Today in attorney misconduct, we’ve got the case of a former U.S. attorney cum Biglaw partner who drank during a client dinner, crashed his car, and then continued driving it after leaving the scene of the accident.

[Stephen R. Wigginton](http://www.armstrongteasdale.com/Stephen-Wigginton/) of Armstrong Teasdale, formerly of the Southern District of Illinois, was arrested in late May after fleeing the scene of an accident in Troy, Illinois, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. Here’s what happened next, according to reporting by the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202794932971/Armstrong-Teasdale-Partner-ExUS-Attorney-Pleads-Guilty-to-DUI-Charge?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=0):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  

Stephen Wigginton

Police dashboard camera video and other records obtained in June by local news outlets under an Illinois Freedom of Information Act request revealed that Wigginton told a police officer that pulled him over, “You know who I am,” and when told by the officer that he did not, replied, “Well, your boss does.”

Troy Police Officer Bryan Brown, who was responding to reports of an accident on U.S. Route 40, pulled over Wigginton in his 2009 black Cadillac after noticing it smoking and missing a headlight as it drove past him. Brown wrote in a police report that Wigginton’s speech was slurred and that he smelled of alcohol. He wrote that Wigginton initially denied drinking, but then admitted that he had a “glass of vodka” while out to dinner with clients on the night of May 23.

As it turns out, Wigginton drove his car off the road, crashed through a fence, drove into and out of a ditch, and then found himself back on the road a short time later. He was charged with DUI, leaving the scene of an accident, failure to reduce speed to avoid a crash, and improper lighting. After initially pleading not guilty, Wigginton later accepted a deal and changed his plea to guilty.

Wigginton was supposed to lose his license for up to a year, but a judge restored it for him. He’ll remain under court supervision for one year’s time, attend a talk for DUI offenders, and pay a fine of $1,500 (double the normal amount).

[Armstrong Teasdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_Teasdale), the 500-lawyer, St. Louis-based firm that employs Wigginton, declined to comment on its partner’s errant ways.

# Davis Polk Is Named After A Segregationist... Perhaps It's Time To Consider A New Name
## For that matter, change Holland & Knight too.

Aunt Jemima is the best-selling syrup brand in the United States and [it’s not even close](https://www.statista.com/statistics/278485/us-households-most-used-brands-of-pancake-table-syrup/). Changing the branding of a successful product is a dicey business move even if it’s a pretty straightforward moral one. Now, roughly a bazillion years too late, the [Aunt Jemima brand will be ditched](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/aunt-jemima-brand-will-change-name-remove-image-quaker-says-n1231260).

Few law firms occupy the rarified air of Davis Polk & Wardwell. It boasts a top 20 Am Law ranking and sits as one of the handful of firms that every major institution considers for high-stakes legal representation across all practices. But as we enter the long overdue era of ending the memorialization of long-dead Confederates and their fellow travelers, Davis Polk should have a serious discussion about rebranding.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
John W. Davis, was one of the most prolific Supreme Court advocates in history, arguing more cases at the high court than almost anyone. That certainly makes for an impressive sentence before you start asking about the big cases he was arguing. He secured the [legality of literacy tests](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/guinn-v-united-states-1915/) to suppress the rights of black voters (UPDATE: Someone helpfully pointed out that Davis represented the U.S. as Solicitor General in that case, and in that role he argued against the legality of the “grandfather clause” but conceded the legality of literacy tests in the case setting up decades of further discrimination) and represented South Carolina in [the companion case to Brown v. Board](https://www.nps.gov/brvb/learn/historyculture/socarolina.htm). Building a book of business around being “the go-to lawyer for Jim Crow” is certainly one strategy.

Lawyers can, of course, argue cases they don’t believe in and shouldn’t necessarily be vilified for doing their job. But lawyering is also a business and at a certain level, attorneys get the work they’re seeking out. It’s not an accident that Davis kept getting tapped by segregationists in their constitutional fights. Davis had argued for black voting rights while serving as Solicitor General, but when he returned to private practice he showed little hesitation in jumping the aisle. In Briggs, the Brown companion case, there’s even a historical dispute over whether or not Davis accepted no payment for his work because he lost or if he took on the matter pro bono from the start. You know, when “for the public good” was somehow interpreted as “segregating schools.” No matter how one cuts it, those aren’t the actions of a dispassionate advocate just doing their job — that’s someone with skin in the game. White skin, as it so happens.

Davis Polk isn’t alone in sporting a troubling name. Holland & Knight is named after Spessard Holland, a Florida politician from the era when the state was a lot more Baja Alabama than South Beach. He signed the “Southern Manifesto” condemning Brown v. Board and attempted to defeat the 1964 Civil Rights Act by filibuster. Holland served in either the House or the Senate for 30 years and grounded his political fortunes in defending Jim Crow laws.

Most people never think about Biglaw namesakes (though we’ve been [pointing these guys out](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/the-biglaw-firm-that-argued-in-defense-of-segregation/) for [years](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/the-biglaw-name-partners-pro-segregation-stance/)). It’s doubtful if anyone even considers the men behind these names when they glance at the letterhead. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t some ugliness lurking there.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
There are problematic people throughout history. For all I know, John Lambert Cadwalader clubbed baby seals. But when it comes to people like Davis and Holland, we’re not talking about people we can honor in spite of their racial politics because their racial politics were integral to their legal legacies. Davis used his practice to further the bloated corpus of racist constitutional law and Holland was a segregationist politician. There’s not much to Holland’s career beyond politics — he was barely even a practicing attorney, having only worked at the firm that bears his name for about three years. These firm names are memorials to icons of a racist past that deserve to be junked.

Obviously these are global brands. Am Law 50 firms with decades’ worth of reputation built on their names. But so was Aunt Jemima syrup. If anything, their success should afford the firms more freedom to rebrand, not less. Whatever name DPW could come up with would still command respect around the world — the sophisticated clientele that hire Davis Polk attorneys aren’t going to be confused. Legal circles almost never used the words “Berkeley Law.” Berkeley WAS Boalt Hall… [until it wasn’t](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/berkeley-law-school-dumps-boalt-hall-name-over-the-whole-virulent-racism-thing/). It’s unusual to point positively to something Dewey Ballantine did, but that might be a good template to follow — hire a household name like Thomas Dewey was at the time and reorient the name around that person. Go be Obama Polk & Wardwell.

And for Holland & Knight… well, being the Knight firm just sounds cooler.

# Shutdown Can't Stop Trump Criminal Cases Because PACER Is A Ripoff... Seriously
## It's good to have a slush fund!

Among the many bad reasons for shutting down the government, starving the judiciary of funds in a bid to delay Trump’s federal criminal cases until the election and hoping he earns the power to pardon himself ranks among the worst. Not just because grinding the federal courts to a halt would necessarily roadblock countless other serious criminal prosecutions, but it also just won’t work.

And we have [decades of unbridled grifting of the federal courts to thank](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/when-federal-judges-said-free-pacer-would-cost-2b-they-were-completely-full-of-crap/)!

House Republicans were already stymied in slowing down the case by hoping to bankrupt Jack Smith — he’s working with a “permanent, indefinite appropriation,” which sounds like something your law school debt provider might say to describe your relationship — so some of them have decided blowing up the courts might be the answer. Not the least of these calls spews from the defendant himself, who [took to Truth Social yesterday](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/111100463579415723) to cheer on a government shutdown to “defund these political prosecutions against me and other Patriots.” Which shouldn’t be a proper noun unless the Justice Department is mounting a case [against years of cheating](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/patriots-spygate-deflategate-bill-belichick-timeline/ovkdjh8ny5qb1fnns9grat5mk), but I digress.

The problem with this strategy [is PACER](https://themessenger.com/politics/government-shutdown-trump-criminal-cases-courts-jack-smith-funding):

In the event of a shutdown, the U.S. court system will remain fully funded for up to [three weeks](https://www.uscourts.gov/news/2018/01/20/judiciary-open-during-government-shutdown). And even after that, the judicial branch of the federal government can tap into “carryover” funds from previous years and fees like the ones charged by Pacer, the online court documents database that costs the public 10 cents a page for downloads.

Yes, the PACER system that offers 2020s access to a 1990s-level database of caselaw for the low, low price of gouging litigants! As the costs of hosting a website have plummeted, the federal courts kept charging per page fees to access public court documents as if you’d rushed to the Kinko’s to run off copies of your personal Zine to hand out at the Toad the Wet Sprocket show.

The courts said it costs $2 billion to maintain this system. [That’s horse hockey](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/free-pacer-would-cost-2b-and-other-completely-made-up-garbage-the-federal-judiciary-is-peddling/). But while they spent years hoodwinking Congress into letting their fees remain undisturbed, the judiciary used the PACER funds that were supposed to be earmarked to keep the system running for all manner of slushy slush fund stuff. As a federal judge described it, the funds would end up [being used for “redecorating the office” or “gold-plated toilets.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/do-you-have-a-lot-of-trouble-answering-questions-generally-in-life-or-just-when-you-come-in-front-of-the-court/)

Ultimately, [the judiciary caved and Congress got involved](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/free-pacer-searches-coming-federal-judiciary-boldly-steps-into-early-2000s/) in putting an end to PACER fees in most instances and opening up public records to, well, the public. And then they [unceremoniously snuffed out that effort](https://fixthecourt.com/2022/12/the-free-pacer-bill-is-not-becoming-law-this-year-but-thats-not-the-entirety-nor-the-end-of-the-story/).

But here we are, staring at the silver lining.

Like the grasshopper and the ant, as other federal agencies used their budgeted funds to cover annual expenses as dictated by law, the courts saved up for the winter of budgetary irresponsibility.

# Lawyer Salaries Have Doubled! Or Have They?
## Beware of this figure.

Over the last 20 years, the average attorney is making twice what their late-90s counterpart made. That sure sounds like an encouraging headline for all the lawyers out there. But it’s not that simple.

The [ABA Profile of the Legal Profession](https://www.americanbar.org/news/reporter_resources/profile-of-profession/) provides a [wealth of knowledge about the state of the industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/new-aba-report-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-legal-profession-but-didnt-know-where-to-ask/). It’s the sort of data compilation across segments of the legal landscape that only the largest lawyers’ association in the country could pull off.

But it’s also the sort of undertaking that lends itself to dubious factoids. Across the 100 pages of information, there’s a lot of cherry-picking available. One of the easiest tidbits to fixate upon is the fact that attorney salaries have doubled in the last 20 years, rising from $72,840 in 1997 to $144,230 today (or at least in 2018).

That looks great, but the truth is a lot murkier. First of all, this doesn’t account for inflation. That 1997 figure is actually worth $113,960 in 2018 dollars, meaning attorneys are only making on average about $30K/year over the 1997 cohort. A $30K raise is nothing to sneeze at, but “Lawyers Earn 26 Percent Raise Over 20 Years” doesn’t make for a particularly exciting headline.

It also overlooks a massive spike in law school tuition that outpaced inflation over that run. According to [Law School Transparency’s data on tuition](https://data.lawschooltransparency.com/costs/tuition/), the average annual tuition for a resident public law school student in 1997 was $6,251. That would be $9,779 in 2018 — but in reality, the average resident public law school student in 2018 is $27,160. That’s a 170 percent bump that students are expected to cover with their 26 percent raises. Not a great deal.

It doesn’t get better for non-resident public school or private school students. In 1997 non-residents were paying on average $13,234 or $20,704 in 2018 dollars while in 2018 they actually pay $40,101 which is almost double. Private school averaged $18,726 in 1997 for an equivalent of $29,297 in 2018 and they now pay $47,754. So… private school is a comparative bargain? Maybe. But more to the point, there’s no scenario where lawyers are making enough to overcome the hit they’re taking in tuition.

It gets worse when you factor in debt. It’s not too much of a leap to say that someone earning a $72K in 1997 was much quicker to pay off a nominal $54K debt ($18/year for three years) than someone earning $144K is to paying off a $143K debt. With each additional year it takes to pay off, the size of that obligation grows putting even more strain on the attorney’s supposedly improved financial position.

Obviously some of this legal earnings figure includes people long out of law school who aren’t impacted by the higher cost of school. That’s fair. But when this figure gets bandied about, it’s always going to be framed with the normative claim that the legal profession is a job on the rise in a world of stagnating wages. Don’t fall for it. Lawyers got just as shafted over the last 20 years as everyone else.

# Most Remote Court Conferences Should Be By Phone, Not Videoconference
## Holding most remote court proceedings by phone can help reduce stress and eliminate technical challenges inherent with videoconferences.

As numerous lawyers already know from firsthand experience, many courts have had to adapt to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in order to continue operations while social distancing. A number of courts, especially in areas hard-hit by the pandemic — like New York and New Jersey, where I practice — are conducting virtual hearings and conferences because of current health concerns. In many circumstances, courts have used Zoom, Skype for Business, and other platforms in order to conduct virtual operations, which was rarely done before the pandemic. However, the tried-and-true method of holding court proceedings by phone is the most efficient way to conference matters in most circumstances.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the courts system, it was not uncommon for court proceedings to be held by phone. Sometimes, attorneys were stuck in traffic and could not be at an appearance on time, so they were allowed to call into the proceedings remotely. At other times, attorneys had conflicts, and were given the ability to call into conferences by phone so that everyone was available to conference a case at a time that was acceptable for a court. In other instances, when conferences concerned trivial matters, courts did not see the need to bring all the parties into court to discuss the matter, and judges were content with holding conferences by phone. Most attorneys are used to calling into court conferences, and this typically involves using a call-in number and access codes, a process that is pretty hard to mess up.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
However, since almost all court operations are being conducted remotely, many courts for the first time have been using videoconferencing platforms to hold court conferences recently. It has been difficult for many lawyers to get used to this new technology. As this website has covered at length, [some attorneys have even appeared shirtless, in bed, or with unprofessional backgrounds](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/miami-judge-reminds-attorneys-to-wear-pants-for-zoom-hearings/) while participating in videoconferenced court proceedings. I’d like to hope that this was due to misunderstandings about the technology, but we can’t count out the fact that some lawyers may have simply not understood decorum over videoconferenced court proceedings.

In any case, there are other practical concerns with videoconferencing court proceedings, which I have noticed while participating in remote court conferences over the past several months. If someone is on a videoconference, it is much more difficult for them to change rooms. Most people call in to remote court proceedings from home, and it is sometimes necessary because of noise and distractions to change locations. However, it is very difficult and awkward to change locations in your home when you are videoconferencing, since it is hard to keep the camera on your face, and other people on the call can see you moving around.

Furthermore, the use of videoconferencing apps is causing significant delays in some court proceedings. Sometimes attorneys need to download software in order to participate in videoconferenced court proceedings, and this can hold up appearances. In addition, issues with the internet can make the audio and visual feeds extremely choppy, which can make it difficult to understand what some people are saying. Moreover, videoconferencing usually makes the process of attending a court proceeding more stressful. When people videoconference, they need to make sure their space looks tidy, wear professional clothes, and take extra steps to ensure that people do not bother them during the call. Since people are usually home with some level of craziness already going on all around them, this can make an already stressful event even worse.

While it is understandable why courts wish to connect with attorneys through video, many judges have continued to simply hold phone conferences recently, and the results have been mostly great. Although people may sometimes talk over each other a little more on a telephone conference versus a video conference, this is usually not a big deal unless there are numerous attorneys on a call. Indeed, I recently attended a settlement conference by telephone, and although the case did not settle, the conference went smoothly. All of the parties could understand each other, and if the judge wanted to speak to one attorney without the other attorney listening, he could just call each lawyer directly. I admit that I have been on phone conferences that went too long, and the next conference called in, interrupting our conference. In addition, I have been on some videoconferenced court proceedings that have gone very smoothly. However, by and large, court conferences by phone have been the most efficient and least stressful way to hold remote proceedings.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
All told, if the Supreme Court is conducting their oral arguments by telephone, courts across the country should also consider ditching videoconferencing in favor of the old-fashioned conference call. Dozens of judges and litigators have emailed me over the years, and I’d love to hear any input from jurists or practitioners about why videoconferencing is preferable for run-of-the-mill court conferences. Of course, evidentiary hearings, trials, and proceedings that require people to be seen may be better by videoconference. However, holding most remote court proceedings by phone can help reduce stress and eliminate technical challenges inherent with videoconferences.

# Miami Biglaw Firms Are Looking To Wow Law Students, Laterals
## The Florida market is hot, hot, hot!

Biglaw firms now have a relatively big presence in Miami, and those that have recently arrived to the area are looking for new blood through OCI and lateral recruitment that will make their firms even hotter than the Magic City’s weather.

In fact, four of the city’s latest entrants — Kirkland & Ellis, Sidley Austin, Winston & Strawn, and Quinn Emanuel — are actively seeking out Florida law students to serve as summer associates for next year. The American Lawyer has the details:

Sidley Austin has interviewed 2Ls across the country for its 2023 Miami summer program in a variety of practice areas, management committee chair Yvette Ostolaza said in a statement. The firm looks to bring in 12 summer associates for the inaugural program.

Winston & Strawn is looking to bring in four Miami summer associates next year, a firm representative said.

Kirkland posted a 2L summer program on its website but didn’t respond to questions on the size of the class, and Quinn Emanuel’s Miami office will launch its first summer program next year as well, co-managing partner Sam Williamson said in an interview last month.

Per Am Law, while Quinn Emanuel is definitely recruiting law students in Miami, the firm did not respond to a question regarding the size of its 2023 summer class. King & Spalding, which is also new to Miami as of January 2022, did not confirm the existence of an upcoming summer program.

As far as lateral associate hiring is concerned, Miami’s new Biglaw firms have been bulking up their ranks by poaching attorneys from other local firms. According to South Florida legal recruiter Joe Ankus, the hiring market is still on fire, and he has “five times as many jobs as people.”

South Beach is bringing the heat, so law students and lateral prospects better get ready to be wooed by Biglaw firms. Bienvenidos a Miami!

Last month, we reported that an international Biglaw firm had announced [up to 500 buyouts and layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/biglaw-firm-announces-hundreds-of-buyouts-and-layoffs-almost-500-affected/) as part of a voluntary retirement program in the U.S. and a restructuring program in the U.K. The buyout period has since closed, and we’re hearing that support staff loved the idea so much that there was more interest than the firm previously expected. Oopsie!

Which firm is dealing with an oversupply of people a too eager to leave their jobs?

That would be Hogan Lovells, which offered voluntary retirement packages with “enhanced terms” to about 400 of its senior business support staff members (i.e., those who had been with the firm for at least five years) in the U.S., while at the same time planning for up to 90 job cuts in London. HoLove expected that 5 to 10 percent of those who received a buyout offer would take it, but at the end of the day, about 10-to-12 percent of its senior staffers accepted their buyouts. Around 45 employees are poised to head for the exits, but the firm expected that only 20 to 40 would be leaving.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to a report from [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2017/10/05/hogan-lovells-sheds-staffers-confirms-financial-reporting-tweaks/), Hogan Lovells is going to be just fine:

[D]espite the additional retirements, some jobs will not be lost.

“We are looking at each role on a case-by-case basis,” the firm said. “Some we will replace in the relevant office or elsewhere, some will be moved to Louisville and some we will not replace.”

We wish all of the legal professionals at Hogan Lovells the best of luck in their retirement or should they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry.

If your firm or organization is closing its doors or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know; this is a subject we cover quite closely. Please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Buyouts) or text us (646-820-8477) with any information you might have. Thank you!

# Ted Cruz Complains About Judicial Nominee's Age... At Least He's A *PARTNER* And *ABA QUALIFIED* Unlike The Riff-Raff Cruz Rubberstamped

“This committee has some history with this question, and one person, that if he were applying the same standards, would come out squarely against your being qualified would be the chairman of this committee, Chair Durbin,” Ted Cruz said in a statement so bloody rich you moved up a tax bracket just by reading it.

Cruz, still channeling “Fat Wolverine” up to and including being [canonically Canadian](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/washington/ted-cruz-made-in-canada/), was speaking to DC Circuit nominee Brad Garcia, currently with the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel and formerly a partner at O’Melveny & Myers arguing appeals in DC. Garcia is rated well qualified by the ABA. Cruz was comparing him to [Justin Walker](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/mitch-mcconnell-protests-way-too-much-about-justin-walker-circuit-nomination/), a Trump-appointed DC Circuit judge who… was a Gibson Dunn associate and legal writing instructor at Louisville Law. Walker was rated not qualified (though he did bump it up to well qualified based on a year’s stint as a judge in Kentucky).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Garcia is 36. Walker was 38 when nominated. Cruz thought he’d found a clever angle throwing Durbin’s public concerns over Walker’s experience back at him.

This is going to shock you, but [Cruz’s efforts at cleverness backfired](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/d-c-circuit-nominees-omelveny-work-draws-republican-focus).

Durbin, responding to Cruz, said that Garcia had an “extensive record.” Garcia’s advocacy includes arguing 13 cases before federal and state appellate courts, including a case before the Supreme Court, he said. Walker hadn’t “served as sole or chief counsel on any case tried to verdict or judgment,” Durbin said.

Indeed age was one of the few similarities between the resumes of the two nominees. They both went to Harvard Law and both clerked at the Supreme Court. Two paths diverged in the woods from there, with Garcia becoming a hotshot Biglaw attorney before joining the Justice Department and Walker rising from relative legal academia obscurity on the strength of a law review article love letter to Trump explaining why it’s totally cool to fire the Director of the FBI to shut down an obstruction investigation. So maybe age wasn’t the only vector of “experience” for Durbin when he questioned Walker’s qualifications for a DC Circuit job.

Also, what’s Cruz’s endgame? He did vote for Walker so is he saying Durbin’s a hypocrite but Garcia is qualified?

Meanwhile Senator John “Not The Hot One” Kennedy also pursued some asinine questions at the hearing “Given your age and your experience, are there any partners at O’Melveny & Myers that have more experience that you think would make a better addition to our courts of appeal? Are you the very best that O’Melveny has to offer?” We only nominate managing partners now? Because no one asked if Kathryn “[COVID](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/mask-mandate-struck-down-because-sanitation-doesnt-mean-keeping-things-clean-for-reasons/)” Mizelle was the best Jones Day had to offer [as an associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/shocking-no-one-aba-thinks-biglaw-associate-not-ready-for-federal-bench/).

Also Mizelle was 33 so if this is a race to the age bottom, the Republicans are winning. Does anyone else get the feeling these folks only cared about Dobbs so they can put a literal fetus on the bench for a full 70 years or so? After a trimester stint as FedSoc treasurer, natch.

But Cruz is correct that the youth of judicial nominees is a little ridiculous.  Maybe that’s why we should all come together around [judicial term limits](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/supreme-court-term-limits-bill-should-have-broad-bipartisan-support-so-it-probably-wont/). If both sides didn’t feel like every nomination — especially to the Supreme Court, but not exclusively — needed to be actuarially vetted to hold lifetime office for as long as possible to keep a dead-hand stranglehold on American politics, maybe we could pick some perfectly lovely 60-year-olds to serve a few years.

Until then, this is the way the game is unfortunately played so the least you can do is hope someone with a resume like Garcia’s comes along at 36. Otherwise you get 33-year-old Mizelles waxing about the meaning of the word sanitation or 42-year-old [Lawrence Van Dykes](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/nominee-tries-to-get-away-with-mealy-mouthed-gay-rights-statement-cries-about-getting-called-out-on-it/) calling his circuit colleagues [possessed criminals](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/ninth-circuit-judge-has-had-it-with-trump-judges-insulting-dissents/).

We have standing calls that are important, and particularly important in the virtual world, for connectivity, team building and culture. But we asked, ‘Can we step back from them and use that time to allow colleagues to refresh, charge batteries, switch off, and have time to feel like they can get away without missing out on the team?’

— Dentons U.S. CEO Mike McNamara, commenting on the firm’s plan to [forgo all meetings this week to prevent burnout](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/26/dentons-quashes-meetings-for-a-week-to-counter-burnout-405-82303/) among attorneys and business professionals. This is the second time in five months that the firm has chosen to hold a “no meetings week.”

‘I see MONEY in my future!’

Thanksgiving is two weeks away, which means that bonus season is right around the corner. Wouldn’t it be nice if your law firm gave you a little something extra to be thankful for this year (on top of the midsummer raise)? We sure think it would be! As a little reminder — as if you really needed one — this is what [last year’s Cravath bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/) looked like:

Class of 2017 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $15,000
Class of 2015 — $25,000
Class of 2014 — $50,000
Class of 2013 — $65,000
Class of 2012 — $80,000
Class of 2011 — $90,000
Class of 2010 — $100,000
Class of 2009 — $100,000

With visions of bonus dollars dancing in your heads, it’s time to check in on how people are doing with their billable hours. There are just about seven weeks to go in 2018, and this year, with expenses up across the board thanks to [Biglaw’s base salary increase](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) from $180K to $190K, hitting your targets this year is very, very important. Some firms might make bank-busting payments that will generate sweet headlines, but not all associates will hit the hours mark necessary for the top payment.

Still, with about a month and a half to go, there’s plenty of time to game your stats. Now that holiday season has arrived, attorneys may start dragging out their assignments — after all, some hours here and there could mean a world of difference.

# Did Disgruntled Partners Lead To The Dewey Prosecution?
## Dewey know why the Manhattan DA investigated the financials of the failed firm?

According to a fascinating new filing in the re-trial of former Dewey & LeBoeuf chief financial officer Joel Sanders and former executive director Stephen DiCarmine, two former Dewey partners put pressure upon the Manhattan District Attorney’s office to look into the financials of the failed firm.

As most in Biglaw circles know, three former Dewey execs went on trial last year for their roles in the demise of the firm. After a mistrial, former Dewey chairman, Steven Davis, signed a deferred prosecution agreement, and Sanders and DiCarmine are staring down the barrel of a second trial, slated to begin in 2017.

It is in the context of this new trial that Sanders’s legal team filed documents suggesting two attorneys pressured the District Attorney’s office to investigate the firm’s finances. The American Lawyer reports the finger gets pointed at former prosecutor, and partner at Baker & Hostetler, John Moscow (who it’s alleged was representing the interests of Carmen MacRae III, formerly senior counsel at Dewey, and partner at LeBoeuf Lamb, which had merged with Dewey), and former Dewey partner, now at Winston & Strawn, Seth Farber.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

In court papers, Andrew Frisch, an attorney for Sanders, wrote that the “birth of this case is troubling and should bar the prosecution from alleging that Sanders is to blame for the firm’s demise.
“It has been suggested that the criminal investigation of Mr. Davis in 2012 was pressed by people with unique access to the prosecution,” including Farber and Moscow, added Frisch, a former federal prosecutor and LeClairRyan partner who now runs his own defense firm.
According to Frisch, Moscow, who spent more than 30 years at the Manhattan DA’s office, where he served as chief of the frauds bureau, represented former Dewey & LeBoeuf lawyer Cameron MacRae III, whom Frisch called “disgruntled.”

Farber, Moscow and MacRae all deny they were the driving force behind the prosecution, and Moscow and MacRae further deny they have an attorney/client relationship.

When reached for comment this week, Moscow said he “did not set up a meeting with the district attorney and ask him to prosecute a case.”
Moscow said he learned about the probe of the firm from a newspaper. But he did not deny speaking with people about the investigation of Dewey & LeBoeuf.
“My recollection is that at some point I met with people who were working on the case,” Moscow said, though he declined to identify whom he met with at the time. “My recollection is further that they had been assigned to work on the case before I met them.”
Moscow added that he did not represent MacRae, but he confirmed that they had been in contact and said that they have mutual friends.
“I’m not going to comment on our conversation,” Moscow said. “Nor can I confirm that he called me rather than me calling him.”
For his part, MacRae, now a partner at Duane Morris in New York, said in an email that he “had nothing whatsoever to do with the initiation of the criminal investigation of Messrs. Davis, DiCarmine and Sanders.”
…
As for Farber, Frisch said in court papers that he was a “disgruntled Dewey partner who had previously worked with senior executives of the district attorney’s office to create the annual Dewey award for assistant district attorneys.”
When reached for comment Tuesday, Farber denied the suggestions in Sanders’ memo.
“I can’t speak as to others, but, as to me, that is false,” said the Winston & Strawn litigator in an email.

The allegations in the court filings seem incredible, if true. And they show the depth of anguish the end of the venerable firm really caused. It’s all well and good from behind our computers to smirk in schadenfreude when a Biglaw firm goes down, but there’s a lot of carnage left in its wake.

# Gibson Dunn On Wrong End Of $854K Sanctions Motion
## It's only one side of the story, but it certainly doesn't look good.

Discovery can be hard. But plaintiffs in the class action against Facebook — or Meta or whatever we’re supposed to call it these days — think the social media giant and its attorneys from Gibson Dunn have made it a lot harder than it needs to be. And they’ve got [a hefty sanctions motion](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/04/Sanctions.pdf) over it.

First [noted by Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/facebook-gibson-dunn-face-854k-sanctions-demand-cambridge-analytica-class-action-2022-04-04/), the newly unsealed motion in the Cambridge Analytica class action seeks around $854K in compensation for alleged bad faith in delaying the discovery process. And while there are indications that Facebook and Gibson Dunn have moved more swiftly in recent days, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria noted back in February that he’d “developed ‘quite a strong preliminary view’ that the company and Gibson Dunn had engaged in sanctionable conduct.”

Which is never a great message to receive from a federal judge.

Most fundamentally, the statements of Facebook’s counsel at the January 19, 2022 hearing indicate that the delays here were not accidental, but a two-step litigation strategy of bad faith: first, delay discovery on the ground that it is too early; second, evade it on the ground that it is too late. This strategy merits sanctions.

According to plaintiffs’ attorneys from Keller Rohrback and Bleichmar Fonti, a number of document requests adjudicated by the special master last fall remained unfulfilled as of mid-February and Facebook still hadn’t produced any documents on a number of those requests as of mid-March. Another dispute seems to reveal a troublesome reversal on Gibson Dunn’s part:

At the February 10 conference, though, attorney Snyder stated that Facebook would be able to produce all ADI materials “within one month, if not sooner.” Ex. 28 at 13:4–5. The Court responded that they needed be produced “21 days from today.” Id. at 13:10. “That’s fine, your Honor,” replied attorney Snyder. Id. at 13:11.

These statements cast grave doubts on past representations. When Facebook moved for reconsideration of the Special Master’s initial ADI order, counsel claimed that producing all ADI communications would be wildly burdensome. One of Facebook’s attorneys claimed, for example, that producing the communications would “delay the case for at least another year while we collect, review, and analyze millions of additional documents.”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Now… on the one hand, discovery is a fluid process and tasks that appear onerous at first can ultimately turn out to be mundane. On the other hand, it’s a hell of a leap from “delay the case for at least another year” to “21 days from today” being “fine.”

There are allegations of contentious negotiations over depositions Facebook claimed it needed to take urgently… and then canceled 36 hours beforehand claiming that plaintiffs hadn’t produced the necessary documents. Somewhat begging the question why the depositions were scheduled in the first place. Another set of allegations claim Facebook used all these delays “to argue that it was now too late for Plaintiffs to be seeking rulings on discovery disputes,” which if accurate is chutzpah of the highest order.

The motion is dated March 14, but just got unsealed. Facebook and Gibson Dunn are due to respond next week.

Unless they request a postponement, which would be totally epic.

# New Partners At Paul Hastings: 80 Percent Women

When it comes to diversity in newly announced Biglaw partner classes, we seem to be in a good news/bad news pattern. We got good news from [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cravath-names-new-partners-and-all-three-are-women/), bad news from [Sullivan & Cromwell](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/sullivan-cromwells-new-partners-impressive-yes-diverse-not-so-much/), good news from [Wachtell Lipton](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/wachtell-liptons-new-partners-100-percent-diverse/), and bad news from [Cleary Gottlieb](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cleary-gottliebs-new-partner-class-where-are-the-women/).

Today we bring you good news, this time from [Paul Hastings](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/paul-hastings/). Earlier this month, the firm named five new partners, who will join the partnership effective February 1, 2017. Of those five, four are women, and one is Asian — an impressively diverse group.

The strong performance of Paul Hastings on this metric is not surprising. As we noted earlier this year, PH is a [top law firm for diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-best-law-firms-for-diversity-2017/). But it’s nice to see this tradition continuing.

The new partners also exhibit diversity in terms of practice areas and geography. The group consists of one employment lawyer (with a litigation focus), one corporate lawyer, one finance lawyer, and two lawyers specializing in white-collar criminal defense and government investigations. Two are based in New York, two are based in Los Angeles, and one is based in Shanghai.

Congratulations to this impressive quintet of attorney talent, and congratulations to Paul Hastings for maintaining its strong track record for diversity and inclusion.

# Biglaw's 'Only' Openly Nonbinary Partner Speaks Out

When I came out, I was not aware of any other nonbinary attorneys in Biglaw. After the article came out, I got some responses from other nonbinary attorneys in Biglaw saying, “Hey, yeah, we do exist.”

I, to my knowledge, am still the only nonbinary partner out there in Biglaw, but there are certainly a handful of us who are out and speaking up to be counted in Biglaw. We are out there.

— [Rafael M. Langer-Osuna](https://www.squirepattonboggs.com/en/professionals/l/langerosuna-rafael-m), a litigation partner at Squire Patton Boggs, commenting on their experience in [finding more nonbinary Biglaw attorneys](https://www.law360.com/articles/1349842) since they [publicly came out](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/say-hello-to-biglaws-first-openly-nonbinary-lawyer/) last summer. Langer-Osuna uses they/them pronouns, and says the response from their firm has been “overwhelmingly positive.”

# Judge Posner Has Some Harsh Words For Law Professors

Judge Richard Posner

I don’t doubt that law professors are frequently active outside the classroom and that their academic work sometimes addresses practical issues, but what I’d like to see is evidence of impact. Amicus briefs? Working for nonprofits? Blogging? “Speaking truth to power?” Absurd: speak all you want, professors, power doesn’t listen to the likes of you.

—Judge Richard Posner, as part of [Slate’s Supreme Court Breakfast Table](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2016/supreme_court_breakfast_table_for_june_2016/the_supreme_court_s_immigration_decision_won_t_do_much.html), weighing in on whether legal academics are in a position to or are willing to provide a check on Supreme Court justices’ power and authority. Judge Posner doubts that even the best law professors have the ability to change judicial behavior.

# Gossiping Is Much Harder When Lawyers Work Remotely
## Gossiping can have a negative impact on a law firm since it can impact the perception people have for that firm.

As this website has reported numerous times, and as many people within the legal profession already know firsthand, many law firms are nudging employees to return to offices as COVID-19 fears fade. This has created much tension between management and employees at many shops since numerous employees do not understand why they need to spend time commuting to offices when they can just as easily perform their work from home. I was talking to a colleague recently who noted that it is much more difficult to get gossip about a workplace when people work remotely than when they are in an office, and forcing people to come to offices is making it easier for workers to gossip.

I worked at four different law firms before starting my own practice, and the rumor mill and gossiping at all of these firms was intense. People spent a fair amount of time during the workday kibitzing with coworkers and exchanging rumors about compensation, who would be promoted, who would be picked for certain assignments, and other subject matters. When a firm was doing poorly, the rumor mill was even more intense. Each time someone was let go at a law firm at which I worked, it was immediately apparent to everyone, and the rumor mill churned such that everyone had an opinion about the matter.

Rumors and gossiping are not good for law firms. Perhaps most importantly, this can lead to attorneys and staff devoting less time to their assignments if they are engaged in gossiping with coworkers. Moreover, gossiping can have a negative impact on a law firm since it can impact the perception people have for a firm. Law firms have gone under because rumors about finances and other issues have forced them into a death spiral as partners and staff leave for other shops. People naturally like to gossip and spread rumors either because it makes someone feel important that they know something that someone doesn’t or just to pass the time.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
However, it is much more difficult to gossip with coworkers when people work remotely. This is partially because people often gossip when they organically see someone around the halls of an office or someplace else. It is much harder to have these organic interactions when people only interact over the phone or through text.

Moreover, people might be nervous if they gossip with one another virtually rather in person. People might not want to send text messages because lawyers especially know that such messages can come back to haunt them. Moreover, since many law firms require attorneys and staff to install tracking software on their personal phones, people might justifiably be concerned that their bosses might be able to see things that they text to coworkers.

People are also less likely to gossip while speaking over the phone than in person. There is a greater fear of being recorded when conversations happen over the phone since people cannot see what is being done on the other end of the line. Moreover, it is much harder for people to open up to one another when they are not seeing each other face to face.

There are also just some people that other people do not interact with when they are not in an office. For instance, there were many staff members in an office that I did not ever interact with unless I was in an office. However, staff often have the best gossip around an office since they overhear conversations or talk with brass in a way that is impossible for an associate attorney. As a result, being away from this channel of information can seriously impact the amount of gossip that spreads around an office.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Of course, no law firm boss is going to base their decision on whether to bring attorneys and staff back to an office based on how easy or difficult it is to spread gossip. However, one of the main reasons why law firms are forcing attorneys and staff back to offices is to build culture and so that it is easier for people to share information. Nevertheless, in-person work can also make it easier for attorneys to gossip and share rumors about a law firm.

# 100 Biglaw Firms Putting Diversity On The Front Burner
## Biglaw is working on its diversity problem.

[Everyone knows ](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-jabot-podcast/)diversity is a worthwhile goal, but the actual process of getting there can be fraught. One mechanism to encourage diversity in the legal sphere that has gotten a lot of traction is the Mansfield certification process.

For those who might not be tracking, the idea was formed [in 2017](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/get-ready-for-the-biglaw-rooney-rule-as-firms-try-to-actually-do-something-about-diversity/?rf=1), at a Diversity Lab event to really hold Biglaw firms accountable for their lofty diversity goals. Modeled after the NFL’s Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview a minority candidate for head coach or general manager vacancies, the idea was to create a system to encourage Biglaw firms to consider women or minority candidates for leadership roles at the firm. The rule — named for Arabella Mansfield, the first woman admitted to practice law in the U.S. — asks firms to consider two or more candidates who are women, LGBTQ+, or attorneys of color when hiring for leadership and governance roles, promotions to equity partner, and hiring lateral attorneys. To be considered “Mansfield Certified” by Diversity Lab, a firm needs to show that 30 percent of the candidate pool for these positions are diverse.

“The goal of the Mansfield Rule is to boost the representation of diverse lawyers in law firm leadership by broadening the pool of candidates considered for these roles and opportunities,” Diversity Lab said in a news release. “Firms participating in the Mansfield Rule are making great strides in diversifying their leadership.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And the statistics seem to reflect those ideals. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/09/15/as-mansfield-certified-firms-hit-100-diversity-lab-announces-new-midsize-firm-program/) Law.com, those firms that have dedicated themselves to the principle of diversity are seeing a real change in the composition of their leadership:

Among the firms that participated in the program all three years, 65% said they have appointed or elected more underrepresented attorneys to their management or executive committees than they did before Mansfield. Around 63% of firms said they have increased the number of underrepresented attorneys promoted into equity partnership.

There also appears to be a correlation between the number of years participating and firms’ success in promoting racial minorities and women. For example, law firms that have participated for only two years saw just a 55% increase in underrepresented attorneys elected to management.

On the[ inaugural list](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/these-biglaw-firms-are-officially-diversity-certified/?rf=1) of Mansfield Certified firms there were 42 entries, and [last year 64 firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/the-list-of-biglaw-firms-at-least-trying-to-care-about-diversity/?rf=1) could claim certification. This year, we see another upward tick, with 100 firms now Mansfield 3.0 Certified. And next year looks bright as well — 117 firms have already signed up for the Mansfield 4.0 process.

So, which firms are now Mansfield certified? Here are the 100 firms — and those with an asterisk are Mansfield Plus certified, which means the firm’s leadership roles are at least 30 percent racial minorities or women.

# Amid Mueller Probe, Prominent Skadden Counsel Disappears From Website
## Prominent Skadden counsel who supervised a report at the center of the Manafort charges has been deleted from the firm's website.

Robert Mueller’s investigation of Trump’s Russian connections has already resulted in one Skadden associate, Alex van der Zwaan, [pleading guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/former-skadden-associate-who-pleaded-guilty-in-mueller-probe-begs-for-no-jail-time/) to lying to investigators in the Russia probe about his communications with former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates.

When van der Zwaan went down, many of us wondered if this might be the tip of the iceberg of Skadden’s involvement in the matter. After all, if there were something untoward about the report Manafort arranged for Skadden to prepare, justifying the actions of Russian-aligned Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, that could rise much higher than a lone London-based associate.

While Mueller’s office hasn’t announced any further action involving Skadden, eagle-eyed tipsters noticed that Greg Craig, former White House Counsel under Obama and the Skadden counsel who led the Ukraine report, has unceremoniously disappeared from the Skadden website.

We’ve reached out to Skadden for an explanation and will update this story as we learn more.

UPDATE 3:20 pm: Law.com is [reporting](https://www.law.com/2018/04/24/amid-mueller-probe-gregory-craig-retires-from-skadden/) that a “Skadden employee who answered Craig’s phone Tuesday in Washington, D.C., confirmed his retirement from the firm.” A spokesperson for the firm confirmed Craig left the firm, but would not provide any additional details.

# Robert Mueller Will Be Greeted As A Liberator... By Senate Republicans
## By impaneling a grand jury, Mueller makes things even easier for Republicans.

Robert S. Mueller (via YouTube)

The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/special-counsel-mueller-impanels-washington-grand-jury-in-russia-probe-1501788287) reports that special counsel Robert Mueller is impaneling a grand jury to continue his investigation into the Russia and the 2016 election.

It’s a big step. We think of a grand jury merely as a charging tool, but it’s also an investigative tool. Grand juries can subpoena documents and take testimony under oath. They’re useful if you are building a case. Trump, and his people, have a complicated relationship with the truth. A grand jury should deal with that. To paraphrase The Simpsons: On Twitter, you celebrate spin; the grand jury punishes falsehoods.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
At this point, I’m contractually obligated to tell non-lawyers that impaneling a grand jury doesn’t mean Mueller is prepared to press charges in the Russia investigation… but it’s clear that the investigation is heating up, not winding down.

Mueller also made another high-profile legal hire. Greg Anders, of Davis Polk & Wardwell, will be joining the [all-star team](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/robert-mueller-assembles-an-all-star-legal-team/). In the understatement of the day, former federal prosecutor Thomas Zeno told the WSJ: “People like Greg Andres don’t leave private practice willy-nilly.”

I expect this is all just the kind of new Senate Republicans want to hear. They seem pretty eager to move on to the part of the story where they get to work with their boy, Mike Pence.

Here’s some things that have happened in the past week or so: The Senate put Russia sanctions on the president’s desk and [forced him to sign the bill](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-signs-russia-sanctions-bill/story?id=48985465) (troll level: Article I). They’re straight-up [ignoring the president’s request](http://jamiedupree.blog.ajc.com/2017/08/01/big-shift-on-health-care-as-senate-republicans-opt-for-september-hearings/) to keep slamming their heads into the car door that is Obamacare. Lindsey Graham is [defending immigrants](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/aging-unskilled-man-only-wants-young-educated-wealthy-immigrants-in-his-failing-country/). Orrin Hatch, Orrin-Motherf**king-Hatch, is [defending TRANSGENDER RIGHTS](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/07/26/sen-orrin-hatch-transgender-people-people-and-deserve-best-we-can-do-them/512333001/) against Donald Trump.

Who can know if Trump is recognizing these Republican-led attacks on his presidency? I haven’t even brought up the fact that the military seems happy to [ignore the commander’s transgender tweets](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/joint-chiefs-to-trump-thats-not-how-any-of-this-works/), or the fact that somebody leaked the president’s private, classified conversations with world leaders [to the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/politics/australia-mexico-transcripts/?utm_term=.813c298cf963). Read Richard Neustadt’s classic work, [Presidential Power](http://amzn.to/2fcZnV7) (affiliate link): in just six months, Trump has been reduced to only his formal powers. His most important power, the power to persuade, has already been lost.

Even before today’s news about the grand jury, the Senate was working on its biggest threat yet to executive authority. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris Coons (D-DE) have [introduced legislation](http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/345147-senate-bill-would-allow-mueller-to-challenge-firing-in-court) that would limit Trump’s ability to fire Robert Mueller. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) are working on similar legislation.

Under the proposed Special Counsel Integrity Act, Mueller, or any other special counsel, would be able to challenge their firing through arbitration. A three-judge panel would convene within 14 days, and if it failed to find a good “cause” for the dismissal, the special counsel would be retained.

You’ll note I said this bill was a threat to “executive” authority, not just “Trump’s” authority. Constitutionally, it’s a little weird for Congress to be dictating the terms under which the president can fire members of the executive branch. I’m not sure that Congress would win that battle in court. Moreover, this legislation would have to pass both the House and the Senate, and then be signed by… the president. Which seems unlikely. The Special Counsel Integrity Act seems more likely to further embarrass Trump than to actually protect Mueller.

Let’s also remember that we should be able to hold Trump and his administration accountable without Robert Mueller. Congress has the authority to appoint its own special prosecutor. I feel like people forget that. When Richard Nixon fired Archibald Cox, the investigation into Watergate didn’t stop. The Senate had its own committee that was investigating the president. It was the Senate committee — led by Samuel Dash, and Fred Thompson — that was going to get the president impeached.

But it really seems like the Senate Republicans have put all their hopes in Bob Mueller. They seem to want Mueller to do this for them. He’s doing them a solid.

# Evaluating Global M&A: A Bad Year... Except For One Firm
## How are we going to afford all those raises?

Yesterday’s [Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/morning-docket-10-06-16/#more-437781) noted that White & Case was on top of Bloomberg’s global deal charts. In another, more detailed M&A ranking, White & Case remains at the top of the pack, but what’s striking are the internals — White & Case is the only leading firm having a better year than in 2015.

If anyone would like to panic that the recent round of “MoneyLaw” raises mark the beginning of financial apocalypse, now would be the time.

Mergermarket just came out with its [Global M&A Roundup](http://www.mergermarket.com/pdf/MergermarketLAReport.Q32016.pdf) for Q1 through Q3 of 2016, and the comparison of global deal value from the comparable period in 2015 for the top 20 firms is frighteningly bleak.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
White & Case closed $424.4B in deals during the first three quarters, marking a 5.5 percent improvement in deal value over the same stretch last year. But then you look at the competition. Davis Polk — down almost 40 percent; SullCrom — down 58.7 percent; Wachtell — down 53.6 percent; and Cravath — down 65.5 percent. MoFo, clocking in at 20th in global deal value, did the second best compared to last year recording only a 35.4 percent decline in deal value. Latham, last year’s number 3 in global M&A across 3 quarters, is off just shy of 90 percent.

To-date in 2016, 12,283 deals worth US$ 2.2tn represents a 20.2% value decrease compared to the same period in 2015…

There is some good news to be had because activity is up the last two quarters suggesting a positive trend, but the overarching drop-off from the previous year can’t inspire confidence.

But if there’s hope for M&A, it has to hinge on Donald Trump’s defeat, because it’s all about China:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Acquisitive Chinese buyers remain a key driver of M&A globally, with 201 deals worth US$ 141.2bn so far this year targeting rms outside of the Asia-Paci c region overtaking all annual deal values and volumes on Mergermarket record (since 2001). Chinese dealmakers are the dominant force behind Asia-Paci c’s outbound activity (434 deals, US$ 162.9bn), accounting for a record 84.7% of deal value, and 46.3% of deal count. The most targeted sectors by Chinese dealmakers were Industrials & Chemicals (64 deals, US$ 68.5bn) and Technology (29 deals, US$ 24.0bn), which recorded year-on-year value increases of 498.4% and 297.2%, respectively.

That said, the US remained the top market for M&A, with 43.8 percent of the global share, highlighted by Bayer’s Monsanto bid and a huge dose of Energy, Mining & Utilities deals.

Other highlights from the detailed report:

* Japan thinks defense wins championships: “[D]omestic activity now comprises a 90.5% share of total Japanese M&A.”

* Europe’s in a holding pattern: “European M&A is facing challenges due a wave of macro-economic uncertainty sweeping across the continent, with Brexit, the upcoming Italian referendum, French and German national elections all affecting dealmakers’ confidence.”

* Rebuilding trust takes time: “Central & South America is exhibiting signs of a modest recovery after the sharp downturn that began in 2015 against a backdrop of falling commodity prices and deepening corruption scandals.”

* The new frontier: “The Middle East & Africa is the fastest growing region in terms of M&A deal value year-on-year, with 288 deals worth US$ 65.3bn representing a 146.8% rise compared to the same period in 2015 (US$ 26.5bn, 366 deals), and overtaking all annual values since 2007 (US$ 88.2bn)” — and who’s driving this boom?

We have some unfortunate news from New York, where the founding partner of one of the largest law firms in America recently passed away.

[Leonard Rivkin](https://www.rivkinradler.com/attorneys/leonard-rivkin/), 95, was the founding partner of Rivkin Radler, which recently was ranked at #209 on the 2020 edition of the NLJ 500. After serving in the Army during World War II, Rivkin returned with a Silver Star and two Purple Hearts before he graduated from UVA Law. He founded the firm by himself in 1950, and today, the firm has almost 200 attorneys. The New York Law Journal once referred to the firm as “the largest suburban law firm in the U.S.” The [Long Island Business News](https://libn.com/2020/07/13/leonard-rivkin-founding-partner-of-rivkin-radler-dies-at-95/) has an inspirational snippet from Rivkin’s memoir, “May It Please the Court”:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
In an excerpt from the book, Len explains how he grew the firm;

“How did I do it?”

“… With a uniquely aggressive and creative approach to business development and litigation strategy.

The essence of that approach; take the initiative.

In other words, do not sit on your hands waiting for something to happen: make it happen.

Do not react to your adversaries; make him react to you…”

Among the first to embrace legal marketing, Rivkin added, “This approach is not just a litigation tactic; it is a sure-fire way to develop and expand a law practice. Clients do not materialize in an attorney’s office out of thin air. They will not find you unless you find them first…”

William Savino, the firm’s former managing partner, said Rivkin “had a remarkable influence and impact on so many people,” and that he was a “truly a unique human being” whose “legacy is palpable in the spirit and character of the Firm he founded.” Evan H. Krinick, the firm’s current managing partner, remembers Rivkin as “charismatic and charming, as well as ambitious and driven.”

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our sincere condolences to Leonard Rivkin’s family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.

# Cravath Backtracks On The 'Flexible' Part Of Its Flexible Office Policy
## We really liked Cravath's proposed office policy... but alas, it appears to be no more.

When Cravath unveiled its first stab at a hybrid office policy, [it looked like a pretty good plan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/cravath-lays-out-3-5-day-week-remote-working-model/).

While other firms scrambled to find the sweet spot between a 3-day or 4-day model, Cravath opted for maximum flexibility, informing its attorneys that the firm felt they should be out of the office about 6 days a month — a plan we dubbed the “3.5-day” model. Though despite the name, Cravath stressed that it left the distribution of those 6 days up to the lawyers, noting at the time, “We expect and trust that professionals of the caliber of our people can determine how that should translate into their weekly routine when we are back in the office.”

Contrast this [with firms like Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firms-three-day-office-workweek-descending-into-paranoid-surveillance/), where the 3-day policy mandates the precise days everyone comes in. Forcing everyone in on certain days manages to be the worst of all worlds, forgoing any hoteling benefits a firm can generate from evenly distributing office use throughout the week while alienating lawyers who aren’t looking for half-baked 4-day weekends, but genuine flexibility to deal with whatever challenges they’ve got at home. That mandatory attendance inevitably devolves into a surveillance state only makes matters worse.

Unfortunately, it seems as though Cravath has stepped back its commitment to flexibility since the first announcement and moved more in line with the Ropes model. From an email sent to the whole firm last month:

We hope to continue to get back to a more normal office environment this fall. To that end, beginning the week of September 12, Tuesdays and Wednesdays will be designated in-office workdays where everyone across the Firm is expected to be working from the office. We also strongly encourage everyone to work from the office for a third weekday each week (which can vary week to week).

On the plus side, this reads like a “2.5” model, which affords lawyers an extra day to work with. On the down side, designated work days retreat from the flexibility touted in the earlier announcement.

These may be inevitably related: the benefit of a model that required people in the office for 4 days every couple of weeks guaranteed the sort of personnel overlap firms hope to revitalize. When firms scale back far enough, there’s a risk of attorneys becoming ships passing in the night. Would lawyers rather be in the office less but on mandated days or in the office more with flexibility? My sense is the latter.

Hybrid office models are still in their infancy, and there will be more twists and turns before the industry settles on the preferred model. But it looks like one promising option has already lost out.

We look forward to welcoming our newest colleagues to the firm. We are confident that, together, we will be able to meet the challenge of the months ahead and hold a Summer Program and a 1L Fellowship Program, in whatever form those programs take, that are rewarding, successful, and engaging.

— [Abid Qureshi](https://www.lw.com/people/abid-qureshi), chair of Latham’s global recruiting committee, in a statement given as to the status of the firm’s [incoming summer associate class](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/latham-jones-day-stay-committed-to-summer-associate-programs). Latham still plans to hold its annual program, but the form it will take remains up in the air. The firm remains fully financially committed to all of its summer associates.

(Recall that in 2009, during the height of the Great Recession, Latham laid off 440 employees — [190 associates, 250 staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/02/nationwide-layoff-watch-latham-cuts-440-190-associates-250-staff/) — in a single day. From then on, [“Lathamed”](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/06/how-did-latham-become-the-poster-child-for-layoffs/) became slang for getting laid off.)

# Biglaw Associate Raises May Be Nice, But They Could Come With Some Harsh Consequences

Many firms that took on the expense of increasing associate salaries can ill afford to be permissive of chronically underperforming practices, offices or lawyers, and can ill afford to be permissive of chronic excess capacity.

—Kent Zimmermann, analyst at the Zeughauser Group, [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2019/05/15/have-the-2018-associate-salary-hikes-caught-up-with-big-law-389-68959/) that with associate salaries taking up an increasingly large portion of Biglaw firms’ expenses, firms will have to take tough stances with attorneys that are not performing as expected. That sentiment was echoed by an anonymous law firm leader that bluntly told Law.com, “There’s going to be less tolerance for underperformance.”

# Hot Litigation Firm Matches Cravath Salary Scale -- Are Boutiques The Big Salary Bump Winners?
## High-end boutique blows away some lagging Biglaw competitors.

Another boutique makes the move to join the Cravath pay scale. Holwell Shuster & Goldberg, the young boutique founded in 2012 by former Southern District of New York Judge Richard Holwell, along with litigators Mike Shuster, Dan Goldberg, and Dorit Ungar Black, announced last night that it would also match the Cravath scale. The National Law Journal put the firm on its “Hot List” and now we know why — they’re moving with the leaders of the Biglaw pack.

You may know Holwell Shuster for its [epic rap prowess](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/partner-absolutely-kills-it-at-holiday/) — perhaps this post should be titled “Dollar Dollar Bills Y’all” — but the rapidly growing firm is not to be messed with. The firm is now boasting upwards of 50 associates peeled away from Biglaw mainstays, including a pair of Supreme Court clerks ([Daniel Sullivan/Scalia and Vincent Levy/Ginsburg](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/08/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-watch-the-official-list/)). And with this move, it’s not going to lose its star recruiting power any time soon.

So are boutiques just killing it this salary increase cycle, or what? Remember, it was litigation boutique [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-firm-bumps-associate-salaries-to-match-180k-scale/) that first matched Cravath’s new benchmark. With some of the traditional, full service firms either dragging their feet or affirmatively opting out of this round of increases, it’s worth recognizing that the elite boutiques are displacing some of the old guard giants. And, yes, “displacing” is the right word — if you’re a “Biglaw” firm and don’t match this right away, you’re telling the market you’re not playing with the grown-ups anymore.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It makes a lot of sense. In-house counsel don’t want their money wasted training a bunch of wet-behind-the-ears first-years. That’s why they’ve been [moving more and more work to smaller firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/10/general-counsel-increasingly-dumping-the-top-biglaw-firms/). Boutiques that recruit heavily from the mid-level ranks of Biglaw firms get all the talent without spending valuable resources on litigation bootcamp. That’s a good deal for any client.

In any event, congratulations to the whole Holwell Shuster & Goldberg team!

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Partners On The Hot Seat: Firms Are Demoting Partners Hand Over Fist
## Time to trim the partnership fat.

Remember when partnership sounded like securing a key to a magical kingdom? Sure, the work would be hard, but with high effort came high reward. And the job security simply couldn’t be beat. Law firms don’t fire partners… well, unless they commit securities fraud or something, but they don’t fire partners on their best behavior!

Welcome to 2016, friends. Being a Biglaw partner just ain’t what it used to be.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The Wall Street Journal notes that [law firms are demoting](http://www.wsj.com/articles/law-firms-demote-partners-as-pressure-mounts-over-profits-1476137818) — if not firing — partners at a healthy clip over profitability fears:

Faced with client pressure to keep down costs and industry competition to achieve the highest profits, law firms now frequently assess which lawyers are worthy enough for the top rungs of partnership. Those who don’t bill enough hours or bring in enough business are quietly asked to leave or demoted from the so-called equity tier.

In a survey of law firm leaders from late last year by legal trade publication the American Lawyer, 56% said they planned to take away equity from partners in the coming year, and 67% said they planned to ask partners to leave.

The story comes on the heels of Shearman & Sterling’s announcement that it was eyeing a [partnership demotion to salvage some profits](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/this-biglaw-firm-may-demote-partners-to-boost-profits/) and Chadbourne getting hit with a [$100 million discrimination suit](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/) after it demoted litigatrix Kerrie Campbell.

Why the sudden rush to give partners the boot? Well, some of it has to do with partners coasting on past success. Legal consultant Peter Zeughauser told WSJ that there are “a lot of firms” with partners billing in the 1100-hour range. That’s pretty extreme, but I’d be curious to know if these are the partners getting shoved aside. Having seen (and even prepared) a Biglaw bill or two in my time, it struck me that the underbilling partners tended to be the very senior attorneys who may not be logging many hours but whose connections brought the business in the door. They may not be directly adding to the firm’s coffers, but the indirect value could not be discounted. These partners aren’t getting shunted into a non-equity track.

After a summer of unbridled — potentially reckless — optimism with associate raises reaching nearly every corner of Biglaw, there had to be another shoe to drop. Unless firm profits skyrocketed this year, raises were going to cut into the PPP unless firms started cutting back on the denominator a bit.

Perhaps this marks the first, furtive steps into a [new Biglaw model](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/the-evolving-law-firm-partnership-divergent-perspectives/), where the 8-year track gives way to a more corporate structure featuring a well-compensated middle management tier spending 5-10 additional years in a non-equity role. In the short term, no firm could make such a wholesale change because its rivals would eat them alive in lateral recruiting. But with demand anemic and the almighty PPP figure looming over everything, big players in the industry might take the hit to be on the forefront of the next organizational revolution.

After all, the current model dates back to the turn of the last century. It’s possible the market has evolved since then.

# Biglaw Firms Just Don't Want Too Many First-Year Associates
## Things don't look great for wannabe first-year associates.

The latest Thomson Reuters Institute[ Law Firm Financial Index](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/lffi-q3-2023-slowed-hiring/) is out. It’s a kind if mixed bag for firms trying to maintain their profitability — the Am Law 100 will likely do better than others further down the ranking or midsize firms. As William Josten, manager for enterprise legal content at the Thomson Reuters Institute, noted, “For the market as a whole, I think 2023 will turn out to be a decent year—it’s not going to be an outstanding year. There’s going to be a wide range in that average. Some firms are doing very well, and some are struggling.”

But, as [reported ](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/law-firms-slow-hiring-third-quarter-amid-push-profitable-2023-report-2023-11-06/)by Reuters, one area where pretty much all the firms are looking to cut expenses is hiring newbie attorneys. Across the board, hiring of first-year associates is down.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The average number of new first-year associates at Am Law 100 firms was down nearly 17% this September compared with the average from the previous two years, according to the index, which tracks key financial metrics across 177 large and midsize U.S.-based law firms. First-year class sizes were down an average 25% among the Am Law 200 firms, while midsize firms brought in 9% fewer first-year associates, according to the index.

The hiring decline is specific to first-years, as there’s still a brisk lateral market, particularly at midsize and Am Law 200 firms:

That industrywide slowdown in new associate hiring hasn’t been enough to offset other headcount growth among midsize and Am Law 200 firms, driving overall law firm direct expenses up more than 6% in the third quarter of 2023. While overall associate headcount declined 1% at Am Law 100 firms compared with a year ago, it grew 4% and 8%, respectively, at Am Law 200 and midsize firms, according to the index.

It’s certainly understandable that firms are looking to minimize their expenses, but that doesn’t make it any easier for those who are looking to start their legal careers.

# An Impeachment So Nice They Did It Twice
## The second impeachment of Trump's tenure raises easily answered questions.

Can the Senate try a former president on an impeachment charge? Must a fact witness recuse themselves from serving as an advocate in a trial? The answer to both of these questions is obviously “yes,” and yet the last week involved a number of right-wing outlets trying to muddy the waters, up to and including Jonathan Turley demanding that everyone stop citing Jonathan Turley. Joe and Kathryn also discuss the Supreme Court’s race to approve executions in Trump’s waning days and the state of the legal industry entering 2021.

# Biglaw And Balance For Working Mothers? Yes!
## It's a simple desire, yet one that is elusive to so many Biglaw attorneys: to spend meaningful time with your family on a near-daily basis while continuing to excel at your job.

It was 5:01 on the dot and I was, once again, headed down the office elevator with the same crew of support staff that clock out at 5:00 every day. I had exceeded my 5.6-hour billing target for the day, and was heading home to spend time with my husband and baby.  It was a Wednesday (pre-pandemic), and I telework Thursdays and Fridays every week, so I would not be back in the office until Monday. I had no plans to log on to Citrix that night.

As an associate at an Am Law 100 firm in a top-of-market city (not New York City), this reality often felt much like a dream. I had a simple desire, yet one that is elusive to so many Biglaw attorneys: to spend meaningful time with my family on a near-daily basis while continuing to excel at my job.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Biglaw is, unfortunately, not known for being family-friendly, and it can be especially challenging for new mothers. But the horror stories you hear are not a universal experience. While I don’t claim to have all of the answers, my experience balancing motherhood and Biglaw for nearly three years now has been a success story. Of course, my idea of “balance” may not be yours. But I hope my story inspires you nonetheless.

When I was in law school, a Biglaw partner once tried to sell me on the family friendliness of his firm by explaining that an associate with whom he worked left at 5 every day and “just got right back online” after her kids went to bed each night. So … family friendly is working an eight-hour day, taking care of children for a few hours, and then working for a few more hours? Every day?  That sounded miserable.

Flash forward a few years, and I was pregnant with my first child. It was a miserable pregnancy. Among other issues, my doctor kept sending me to the hospital midworkday for hours of monitoring and testing. Thankfully, my office was very accommodating; the message I received over and over again was to do whatever I needed to do to take care of myself and the baby.

While on maternity leave, I thought a lot about how to balance working with family upon my return. Ultimately, I decided to propose an alternate arrangement to the firm in which I would work at a 70% capacity and telework two days a week. If it worked as planned, I would be able to leave at 5 p.m. most days (instead of 6:30 or 7 p.m., as I had before), and work substantially reduced hours on my telework days to spend more time with my child.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Several people cautioned me that my plan was unwise. The risk, of course, is that I would do just as much work as before, but at 70% pay. Some friends suggested I would be better off in-house; others suggested sticking with a regular schedule and just mysteriously finding a way to make it all work.  Thankfully, my experience has been quite positive. Often, when things are busy, I do log onto the computer after my kids go to bed to knock out the rest of a project; but it is (usually) with a feeling of enthusiasm for the work, rather than a compulsion to squeeze more hours into an already-long day. Other times, I take whole afternoons or Fridays off. And it is as marvelous as it sounds.

My advice to anyone considering an alternate path (whether a mother, father, or just because):

- Don’t be afraid to chart your own path. Just because others follow one path doesn’t mean you need to.
- Make yourself indispensable. Be the “go-to” person for something, or, ideally, for many things. People will be much more willing to accommodate you when they want you to stick around.
- Surround yourself with people who support you. For some, this may mean considering a “lesser” firm or changing firms to find a more supportive environment. Ultimately, being in an environment in which your team is committed to your success is key.
- Figure out your strengths and tailor your approach accordingly so that you can still do your best work. If you’re known for plowing through thousands of documents in a crunch, find a way to still do that when needed (via your childcare arrangements, etc.). If you’re known for coming up with creative ideas, think about what you need to ensure you still do that.
- Be transparent. I make sure the people with whom I work closely are aware of my alternate schedule, and I never try to fool my colleagues into thinking I’m working late when I’m not (such as through the age-old trick of leaving my door open with the light on after I leave). When I walk out at 5, I wave goodbye to my colleagues. I am getting paid 30% less, and I am entitled to work 30% less.
- Be flexible. My practice area is fast-paced and sporadic, so I knew that if I wanted to succeed on an alternate schedule, I had to be flexible. If something important comes up on a day I planned to take off, I typically find a way to make it work, and then make up for it another time. Yes, this can be frustrating at times, but I try to focus on the big picture and not to let an occasional “off week” bother me.
- Don’t be afraid to say no. If you want to have any semblance of work-life balance, you must learn how to delegate and how to say no. Say yes to the mission-critical projects, even the ones that ruin a perfect Saturday at the pool; but then practice politely declining the many other things that crop up, but that do not work for your schedule.
Ultimately, Biglaw will always be a hard job. Perhaps the biggest challenge is finding balance. But, in my experience, finding this balance provides the greatest reward.

China — the O.G. superspreader — is still deeply concerned about COVID-19 and prepared to take drastic measures to keep a lid on the virus. It’s a pointed contrast to the United States, where we allow a [Jones Day associate with a copy of a 1940s dictionary](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/mask-mandate-struck-down-because-sanitation-doesnt-mean-keeping-things-clean-for-reasons/) to strip the Centers for Disease Control of public health authority, while China’s still responding to even the hint of viral outbreak with full lockdowns and lengthy quarantines.

One suspects there’s probably a middle ground where countries have a vaccine mandate and otherwise get back to work, but it’s 2022 and we can’t have nice things so you have to choose between totalitarian lockdowns and letting Karen launch unvaccinated spittle into your face while she explains why schools need to be more balanced when teaching the Civil War.

In any event, the lockdowns in China ensnared one Biglaw partner who found himself stranded in a quarantine hotel when the country imposed new restrictions this spring.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Forbes has [an interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2022/04/25/american-lawyer-quarantined-for-37-days-in-china-describes-chaotic-environment/?sh=2e02f4591c56) with Perkins Coie partner [James Zimmerman](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/james-m-zimmerman.html), who has worked in China for almost a quarter century, but found himself locked up when he tried to return home after Christmas.

Zimmerman flew to the United States for heart surgery and, after recovery, began the trek back to Beijing. He only made it to Shanghai before COVID policy caught up with him. After 22 days in Shanghai, he’s now gotten permission to get back to Beijing, but he’s still not free to go home and instead relegated to a quarantine hospital:

“The State Department needs to release another advisory that warns people that they might end up in central quarantine for 37 days, like me,” Zimmerman said in an email exchange today. “It’s not just a manageable 14 days. But given the lack of transparency of China’s policies, even the U.S. government is having a challenging time predicting the unpredictable.”

While the food is improving for Zimmerman after he complained about the rotting fruit, the heart patient really needs to be transported back to his home. But the Chinese government doesn’t have much time for nuance:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The government’s reaction to the outbreak in Shanghai the past month is a textbook example of China’s clumsy policy decision-making process. When someone at the top shouted to shut down the city, that is all that the local officials needed to hear. Nobody thought to evaluate the practical consequences of such draconian measures. What did they expect when, without warning, they locked down a city of 27 million people, and then wonder why there was a rush of panic buying and no food to feed the masses? Logistics matter. And the same thing is unfolding in Beijing this week.

It’s a reminder that there are a lot of moving parts in responding to a crisis and without thinking through all of the consequences, one bold move just screws up a hundred other concerns. This is the sort of thing a responsive government that gives administrative deference to professional planners can avoid — to the tune of turning in [booming growth during a pandemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/27/gdp-2021-q4-economy/) — but the Framers didn’t put the word “mRNA” anywhere in the Constitution so I guess that’s a no go.

Meanwhile, Zimmerman has some pointed thoughts about how all this bodes for the future of Chinese business investment:

On the overall impact for the foreign business community, my assessment is that foreign business – and that includes from the U.S. and EU – is starting to question how this government is managing the economy, the pandemic, and its geopolitical relationships. While no one in the foreign business community wants to talk about decoupling or divestment, there clearly is a strong inclination to take a closer – and more critical look – at the business environment.

And where foreign investment goes, so goes Biglaw in China.

# Gun Ruling Proves Supreme Court Just Coasting On Vibes At This Point
## Bruen proves that we knew what Heller meant all along.

Earlier this week, Jamelle Bouie offered a [stinging and completely on point](https://twitter.com/jbouie/status/1539288561249288193?s=20&t=ESd3zkaobvM0zk7sGzwE_w) critique of The Atlantic. In an article that the magazine confoundingly edited and approved, Brookings Institution Senior Fellow Shadi Hamid riffed for almost 2,200 words critiquing an anonymous “in certain circles” straw adversary. As Bouie said, “you could make a weaker, more narrow claim, but then you might have to contend with what your opponents actually believe and argue… much easier to coast on vibes.”

Juxtapose this with a recent New York Times op-ed by Kate Shaw and John Bash titled, “[We Clerked for Justices Scalia and Stevens. America Is Getting Heller Wrong](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/supreme-court-heller-guns.html).” In it, the pair wrote that “we think it’s clear that every member of the court … agreed that the Constitution leaves elected officials an array of policy options when it comes to gun regulation.” Not to get too technical, but in legalese this contention is what we call “total bullshit.”

Which brings us to today, where the [Supreme Court has ruled 6-3](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/06/Bruen.pdf) that states have no legal authority to regulate guns in public. Or, to be more precisely cynical, states DO have legal authority to regulate guns in public as long as that regulation amounts to a non-discretionary rubberstamp of every request to carry concealed weapons.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
From the Shaw and Bash op-ed, “We are aware of no evidence that any perpetrator of a mass shooting was able to obtain a firearm because of a law struck down under Heller. But Heller looms over most debates about gun regulation….”

Yeah… and for good reason!

Because everyone able to step two feet from under the suffocating high of tugging a Supreme Court justice’s robes knew what Heller meant. It never mattered what Heller said or what mealy mouthed qualifications Scalia shoehorned into the opinion about “sensitive places” to offer some illusion of baseline reasonability. The opinion stood for the maximalist position it implied, never the carve outs it enumerated for reputational expediency.

Because Scalia did include language in Heller explaining that, while the opinion only dealt with keeping guns in the home, everyone would be fine with this precedent because hypothetical laws about regulating guns in “sensitive places” for public safety would still be allowed.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Which was always a joke.

New York argued that stopping people from sneaking guns onto the subways and stadiums would constitute such a sensitive place. Justice Thomas dismissed this out of hand. “Sensitive places” can still be regulated… he just isn’t willing to identify what such a place is except, presumably, [a few blocks from Kavanaugh’s house](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/politics/man-arrested-near-brett-kavanaugh-home/index.html). “Like Heller, we ‘do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis . . . of the full scope of the Second Amendment,” he wrote, cribbing Justice Stewart’s “I know it when I see it” standard. There might be a line where gun regulations are legal, but we won’t let you know where it is (because it doesn’t exist).

But it’s Justice Alito’s “doth protest too much” concurrence that unintentionally underscores the vibes approach.

Much of the dissent seems designed to obscure the specific question that the Court has decided, and therefore it may be helpful to provide a succinct summary of what we have actually held. In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570 (2008), the Court concluded that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep a handgun in the home for self-defense. Heller found that the Amendment codified a preexisting right and that this right was regarded at the time of the Amendment’s adoption as rooted in “‘the natural right of resistance and self-preservation.’” Id., at 594. “[T]he inherent right of self-defense,” Heller explained, is “central to the Second Amendment right.” Id., at 628.

That’s all a lie, by the way. The Justice Stevens dissent methodically debunked the idea that anyone at the Founding believed in a right to self-defense, noting that the Framers were on record that the Second Amendment was just about providing states a guarantee that there would never be a standing federal army.[[1]](#f1)

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Although Heller concerned the possession of a handgun in the home, the key point that we decided was that “the people,” not just members of the “militia,” have the right to use a firearm to defend themselves.

In other words, Alito admits that the Court just erased half of the text of the Second Amendment in Heller. That’s the real meat of what happened. Once you rewrite the Bill of Rights, every speculative exception becomes ephemeral just waiting for the next Court to say, “yeah, but not THAT regulation.”

It’s just like how [the Carson v. Makin opinion](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/supreme-court-opens-floodgates-to-taxpayer-funded-religious-schools/) took the relatively reasonable plurality in Trinity Lutheran, holding that government funds may flow to religious schools if used for generally applicable non-religious uses, and junked all those caveats to use it as the precedent requiring that public taxpayer funds must flow to religious schools. The plurality in Trinity Lutheran thought the carefully balanced halfway point would become guiding precedent setting both a ceiling and a floor to the rights involved.

Instead, it was a speed bump.

That’s the thing — this Court doesn’t see half-measure opinions as precedent: the implied extreme position is the only part that’s binding. Everything else is dicta to be wiped away at the earliest convenience.

So Alito rages that the dissent is overreading what the Court “actually” decided, insulting the intelligence of anyone familiar with the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court is just a game of constitutional Telephone: Trinity Lutheran is just about clearing away the Establishment complaint to giving public funds to religious schools, and that’s now magically the precedent for finding a Free Exercise complaint to not giving public funds to religious schools, and the next case will find a Free Exercise complaint to making taxpayers fund public schools in the first place. One case begets the other while justices go, “Who, Me?” whenever they nudge the narrative forward.

Heller is just about guns in the home… don’t worry, you can still regulate everything else. Oh, sorry, Bruen is just about concealed guns in public… don’t worry, you can still regulate everything else. And on and on as the market floods with guns and people get killed.

Text doesn’t matter, intent doesn’t matter, original public understanding doesn’t matter, precedent doesn’t matter — it’s far too difficult to contend with those — just take the “feels” you get from some prior opinion to advance the ball for the next one.

Which everyone from the justices to the advocates to the legislators seem to recognize except Shaw and Bash:

Justices don’t control the way their writings are interpreted by later courts and other institutions; certainly law clerks don’t. So we’re not asserting that our views on Heller are in any way authoritative. But we know the opinions in the case inside and out.

Later courts? The author of this opinion was ON that court! This isn’t some artifact being viewed through sepia tones, this is the direct-line continuation of the entirely transparent project.

But what they’re acknowledging in a roundabout way is that it is, in fact, all vibes. Maybe Bruen isn’t required by a strict reading of Heller. But who cares? Heller is more of a mood than a statement of considered law. No one walked out of Heller assuming it set a blueprint for future regulation, it listed possible regulations while casually waving a gun around and saying, “awful nice public safety regime you have here, shame if something happened to it.”

No one was “getting Heller wrong.” That’s why we have Bruen.

[ [1]](#reff1) Which, of course, is why there’s a cottage academic industry trying to “square peg/round hole” gun regulation into a new theory of originalism where the relevant “original” intent is the intent at the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. A theory that is, in other words, “how to be ‘originalist’ if the original public meaning conflicts with contemporary GOP policies.” This is what Justice Barrett’s concurrence is all about in case you’re wondering what fresh hell will dominate the next several decades when the conservative majority starts picking Mitch McConnell’s birthday as the trigger point for “original” public understanding or whatever.

# Judges To Generative AI: You're Out Of Order!
## There's disorder in the courts, with no clarity in sight.

Technology and courts have never been a great match. After all, judges are concerned with precedent, while the technology adoption process is future-facing. Certainly, the pandemic helped reduce the friction somewhat when, out of necessity, the courts acclimated to e-filing and virtual court proceedings. Some judges even acknowledged the value and convenience of online appearances for certain matters.

Despite the notable adaptation and changing attitudes, our judicial counterparts were wholly unprepared for the generative AI (GenAI) tsunami and its impact on the practice of law. Since the release of GPT-4 a year ago, lawyers have increasingly relied on the output of GenAI tools to draft and submit pleadings and memoranda to the courts, often without a full understanding of the technology and its capabilities.

As a result, many lawyers have made the news for submitting court filings with GenAI-generated fake case citations despite being repeatedly warned to [carefully review all GenAI output](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/do-not-i-repeat-do-not-use-chatgpt-for-legal-research/). Judging by the uptick in headlines since the start of 2024, more lawyers than ever are relying on GenAI tools for legal research but are utterly failing to meet their ethical obligations of basic competence:

- A lawyer was [sanctioned](https://www.lawnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/12-007-24.pdf) by Massachusetts Superior Court for filing multiple memoranda replete with false case citations (2/12/24).
- A British Columbia lawyer was reprimanded and [ordered](https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/sc/24/02/2024BCSC0285cor1.htm) to pay costs for opposing counsel to discover precedent was AI “hallucination” (2/20/24).
- A Florida attorney was [suspended](https://www.lawnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/M.D.-Fla.-24-mc-00002-dckt-000006_000-filed-2024-03-08.pdf) by U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida for filing submissions relying on false case citations (3/8/24).
-  An attorney, a pro se litigant, was called out by the court for submitting false case citations to court for the second time, and the case was [dismissed](https://www.anylaw.com/case/lee-v-delta-airlines-inc-et-al/e-d-new-york/03-21-2024/hVPCbI4B0j0eo1gqBHWU) following a grant of summary judgment on other grounds (3/21/24).
- The [9th Circuit summarily dismissed a case](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2024/03/22/22-56121.pdf) without addressing the merits because of the attorney’s reliance on fake cases (3/22/24).
To be clear, these situations reveal an inability to meet basic competence obligations. This isn’t an issue of technology competence. Instead, these instances highlight a failure by lawyers to carefully review documents submitted to the court.

It is this dereliction that is spurring judges into action. Courts across the country are grappling with this issue, with many judges signing orders that govern GenAI usage in their courtrooms. RAILS (Responsible AI in Legal Services) has compiled a [running list of these efforts](https://rails.legal/resource-ai-orders/). Forty-eight documents are being tracked (for now), which include orders, guidelines, and rules that are either in progress or have already been issued.

The approaches regarding regulating GenAI usage run the gamut and include: providing guidance about GenAI usage, requiring the disclosure of the use of GenAI, or banning its use altogether. As explained in the RAILS declaration statement, this haphazard and varied set of tactics, while well-intentioned, fails to provide much-needed consistency:

(T)he sheer number of these orders and lack of uniformity [in] their provisions can cause considerable confusion to litigants and practitioners who may have to appear in many different courts.

In other words, there’s disorder in the courts, with no clarity in sight.

Given the increasing number of fake case citations, one thing is clear: the phenomenon highlights evidence of an even deeper problem. Namely, some lawyers are not reviewing their work before submitting it to the court — and this is not a new occurrence.

Historically, cases that seemed out of place within the context of a document could be dismissed as mistakes or misinterpretations of case law. Now, however, false case citations undeniably demonstrate a failure to review submitted work. This type of negligence undoubtedly existed before, but it’s much easier to prove when the cited cases are nonexistent.

In other words, the problem isn’t the technology, it’s attorney competency. This is a preexisting issue, and knee-jerk reactions to GenAI are not the solution. While it’s tempting to react hastily to disruptive technologies, the legal community would be better served by developing robust, uniform educational guidelines on responsible AI use and emphasizing the timeless principles of careful review and thorough legal analysis.

# Litigation Matters Are Often More Stressful Than Transactional Ones

Recently, I was communicating with an adversary on a transactional matter, and we discussed some gripes we had with matters we were handling. I mostly work on litigation matters, and was almost entirely a litigator before starting my own shop around four and a half years ago. These days, however, I pick up transactional matters from time to time to fill in the hours I am not spending on litigation matters. In any case, I was explaining to my adversary about how stressful my week had been with litigation matters, and he responded by saying that, as a transactional attorney, he rarely faces the same stress as litigators. This got me thinking: do some factors about litigation make it more stressful than working on transactional matters?

From my perspective, a few characteristics of litigation which are not present in transactional matters add to the stress litigators face. For instance, litigation is often a zero-sum game in which one party wins and another party loses. Sure, many litigation matters, and issues within litigation are resolved through some type of agreement between the parties. However, if the parties cannot agree to a resolution, the court will eventually need to decide a matter after motion practice, or a court will need to dispose of a matter after trial.

This can make the litigation process extremely high stakes for everyone, including the lawyers. Attorneys at motion hearings and trials can almost seem desperate as they convey the best arguments that might help their client prevail. Transactional matters can be a much more collaborative enterprise in which no party loses everything and no party wins everything. Accordingly, the stakes might not be as high as certain kinds of litigation matters, and the stress involved might be less than in other areas of the law.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Litigation deadlines can also make litigation significantly more stressful than transactional matters. If a litigant files a motion, there is usually a given date by which the opposition papers and reply papers must be served in order to be considered timely. Moreover, courts set deadlines about all kinds of issues, including depositions, expert disclosures, and others. Deadlines can create immense pressure on litigants since there can be major consequences if litigants do not complete tasks by a given deadline. If a litigant has multiple tasks to complete around the same time, it can be difficult to complete everything by a deadline, and this can create enormous pressure.

Many transactional matters also have deadlines. Sometimes, parties need to complete deals under tight circumstances. Indeed, a friend of mine was involved in a deal that began on the Friday before this past Labor Day that needed to be inked by the Tuesday following Labor Day. This probably involved an insane amount of work over a holiday weekend during which many people have longstanding vacation plans. However, tight deadlines are a fundamental part of the litigation process, and the stress associated with meeting these deadlines can make litigation more stressful than many types of transactional matters.

Another thing that makes litigation more stressful than transactional matters is that many events within litigation are public in nature. Often, when parties argue motions in court or present cases at trial, they need to perform in front of an audience that includes their clients. This is very different from transactional matters during which parties do not have to perform in front of other people and merely need to interact with the people involved in a deal in private.

I was at a bench trial earlier this year, and dozens of lawyers and community members were present. This definitely added to the pressure of the event, and when things did not go my way during the trial, I could hear people commenting in the background. Plus, my client was viewing the trial, so I could be criticized and evaluated in real time. In addition, I have argued motions with literally dozens of other lawyers in the courtroom waiting to argue matters themselves. To me, it is much more daunting to argue matters in front of other lawyers than random members of the public since we are all part of the same professional community and lawyers might have more knowledge with which to critique the work on another practitioner. This adds another level of stress and nervousness that has no easy equivalent when lawyers handle transactional work.

All told, there are many things to stress about when handling transactional matters, and the short deadlines involved in some deals, and the big stakes at issue can definitely make certain transactional tasks stressful. However, many built-in characteristics of litigation ensure that many litigation matters are more stressful than most run-of-the-mill transactional projects.

Juan Picon

It isn’t particularly common for a Biglaw firm to lose a member of its leadership team to a competitor, so when it happens, it’s news. Today it’s been announced that Latham & Watkins has snagged DLA Piper senior partner and global co-chair Juan Picon, along with Spanish corporate head Jose Antonio Sanchez-Dafos and capital markets partner Ignacio Gomez-Sancha.

The soon-to-be-former DLA partners will be joining the Madrid office of Latham, with Picon taking on the role of Madrid managing partner. As [reported](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/02/latham-hires-away-dla-piper-co-chair/) by Law.com, Latham is excited about the addition:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Latham managing partner Bill Voge said: “We are delighted to welcome Juan, Ignacio, and Jose to the firm. We have a top-notch team in Spain, and the arrival of this group will be a perfect complement to our existing practice. The team’s market knowledge and industry contacts are second to none. Spain is a key market with exciting opportunities in our global platform.”

The DLA Piper global co-CEO, Simon Levine, offered a gracious statement on Picon’s departure:

We are disappointed that Juan has decided to leave before completing his term as senior partner but we recognise the unique personal circumstances that have led him to make this decision. We wish Juan all the best for the future.

Picon is stepping down immediately from his leadership role at DLA Piper, but hasn’t yet determined when he’ll formally leave the firm. His role as co-chair will be filled on an interim basis by disputes partner Janet Legrand, with an election for his replacement to follow.

# Welcome To The Money Party, Texas!
## Texas mainstay has entered the salary fray.

“Will the raises reach my market?”

That’s the question on the minds of associates across the country this month. While no one seriously expected the New York and DC markets to allow Milbank to waltz into recruiting season all by its lonesome boasting a $190K scale, whether or not the relatively modest cost-of-living adjustment that Milbank unveiled two weeks ago would reach every Biglaw market was a question.

California’s highest-profile firms will match, of course, as we saw with a trio of raises announced today. Chicago appears to be generating some matching momentum too. But what of Dallas? Or Charlotte? These are the markets that many industry observers, [including me](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/), didn’t think merited a full salary scale match in 2016. In that sense, this round of raises serves as a referendum on the wisdom of 2016. After all, any firm that raised salaries in 2016 [has no excuse not to match the new scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-the-milbank-raise-is-not-that-big-of-a-deal-and-why-it-is/) given that it’s a mere cost-of-living adjustment. Any firm — or any market — that doesn’t is hoisting a flag to inform their peers that they now realize they overstepped before.

Houston, the poster child market for [Biglaw’s colonization and displacement of local law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/how-global-biglaw-titans-are-demolishing-local-firms-and-how-to-survive-the-onslaught/), is an interesting case to consider. Biglaw firms with a presence in Houston will mostly bump up their salaries to keep domestic pay equal. Will the legacy Houston firms join, or cede the recruiting wars to the interlopers?

One firm with deep Houston roots has taken the bull by the horns as they might say, and proclaimed themselves a full match.

Vinson & Elkins adopted the full scale, complete with summer bonuses (and increased pay for summers) across their US offices.

As one might imagine, associates are psyched.

V&E MATCHED CRAVATH SCALE + BONUSES in all U.S. offices. We are elated!!!

And…

Associates are very excited and grateful for the raises/bonuses. It’s nice to be at V&E where we lead the Texas market…. We never doubted that we’d follow Cravath but a lot of other friends at other Texas firms don’t/didn’t have the same confidence. Thanks V&E leadership.

As a recent [ALM Intelligence report pointed out](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/how-global-biglaw-titans-are-demolishing-local-firms-and-how-to-survive-the-onslaught/), Texas-based firms have gotten hit hard by outsider firms entering the market, poaching partners and associates, and driving up the competitiveness of the recruiting pool.

V&E clearly feels they’re not ready to go quietly into the night… or, as the case may be, quietly into a smaller market share. Game on, Houston market!

(Check out the full memo on the next page if you want to grab the image and send it around to your bosses…)

# Is This A Good Idea?

A continuing issue for the profession is how to increase diversity and inclusion in law practice. When looking at the so-called pipeline, it’s not usually clogged with a full stream of candidates looking at law as a career. Why? What do you think?

Hard to get into law school, hard to stay in, hard to pass the bar (at least in California but that seems to be changing), hard to get the first job, the second, and so on, hard to figure out how to manage the crushing debt load that accompanies law students, hard to get clients, and hard to keep them, especially if the practice is a “one-off,” like bankruptcy or family law.

And hard to forget the images of lawyers as ambulance chasers, greedy billers, and other unsavory characters. Not to mention the lawyer jokes, yes, the lawyer jokes. No jokes about all the pro bono work, voluntary or involuntary, no talking about good works that lawyers do, almost always without mention. The vast number of our colleagues represent their clients quietly and efficiently. Now, given all those things, why would anyone want to become a lawyer?

That’s the question that the State Bar of California wants to answer in a positive way. “You want to make a difference in the world. Becoming a lawyer is a powerful way to have real impact.” (The State Bar’s language, not mine.) It has [published a brochure](https://publications.calbar.ca.gov/coaf/how-do-i-become-a-lawyer/) that seeks to answer the question “How do I become a lawyer?”

Using that title, the brochure explains how that can happen. It starts out by telling readers that there are two ways to become a lawyer here in California: law schools and the law office study program. ([Think Kim Kardashian West](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/hows-studying-law-going-for-kim-kardashian-its-so-hard/).) It notes that California has over 50 law schools, from ABA accredited to state accredited to registered unaccredited. Of course, the devil is in the details, and the brochure doesn’t go into the differences (maybe for fear that readers’ eyes will glaze over).

The brochure reaches out to high schoolers, college students and graduates, and those who have no college degrees, offering pathways to all of those who want to become lawyers. For the high school students, the mantra is study (get good grades), explore (debate team and other extracurricular activities), and plan (talk to school counselors about how to fund college education). For the college students and graduates, the mantra is study (get good grades and write, write, write, study for the LSAT — if it’s still around), explore (visit law schools, attend court proceedings, volunteer in a legal setting), and plan for how the law school education is going to be paid for. And if there’s no college degree, all is not hopeless, as there are some law schools in California that will admit those degreeless.

Probably because the State Bar doesn’t want to scare prospects off, the brochure is mum about the cost of that legal education. It does suggest that prospective lawyers research grants, assistance programs, and scholarships. (Any hints there?) If none of those pan out, then it’s heavy debt time. I think the brochure misses the mark by not being transparent about the cost of a legal education, especially when it is piled on top of undergraduate loans. The cost may indeed scare some away, but isn’t it better to be candid up front about the financial commitment? Some newer lawyers might have chosen to do something else, rather than racking up ginormous debt.

TV shows and movies portray the “glitz and glamour” of the profession, but the reality is something quite different. Yes, you can be a trial lawyer in government or private practice, but if the latter, you won’t try many cases, given the expense. Yes, you can be a litigator, but I wonder how many wide-eyed prospects understand that litigating is usually discovery and motion practice and can be incredibly dull and dreary.

The threshold question for prospective lawyers is what they would want to do with the bar license: practice law with its possibilities for social justice or something else? Much of law practice is prosaic work, repetitive to the point where you want to stick a fork in your eyeball for variety, but I’ve always thought that a legal education is worth having, if you can bear the cost.

It can be a rewarding profession, especially when you think you’ve made a positive difference in a client’s life, when a client thanks you for your time and effort, and even pays your fees without complaint (!), but those times can be few and far between. It can also be the profession from hell, when clients refuse to take your advice, think you’re a moron (and that’s the nicest word I will use here) and believe your bill is way too high for the services rendered, and so it’s either heavily discounted or not paid at all.

I would have liked to have seen a warning about how much a legal education will cost. Honesty is still the best policy. Not everyone will get Biglaw jobs or want them, and so prospective lawyers should know, certainly in college, the costs. It’s fine to talk about access to justice, but it’s not just about the representation, but about paying for the education that will provide that representation. Student loans are not difficult to come by, but paying them off is another kettle of fish altogether.

Hopefully, this brochure will encourage prospective lawyers to consider and then embark on legal careers, diversifying what it is still a homogeneous profession (although it’s improving … but way too slowly). It says that if you want to become a lawyer, you can do it. Implicit in the brochure is encouragement for minorities to become lawyers and return to their communities, to provide access to justice. Clients want and need lawyers who look like them. For far too long, that has not been the case.

Wellness has taken on an increased import at elite law firms. Happier associates are better at their jobs, so the push is on to make sure that wellbeing is prioritized along with billable hours.

Magic Circle firm Slaughter and May has [reportedly](https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/06/pawsitive-vibes-slaughter-and-may-trials-bring-your-dog-to-work-day/) taken this push to the dogs, and it’s paws-itively delightful:

Deborah Finkler, who last month became the firm’s first female managing partner, commented: “I have long been an advocate of having our dogs in the office and so am delighted that we are trialling Slaughter and May’s first ever Bring your Dog to Work Day.”

Finkler, a dog owner herself, continued:

“The benefits of all animals and especially dogs to mental health, morale and alleviating stress are widely recognised, and I also hope that the trial makes for a fun and sociable day.”

As reported by Legal Cheek, Slaughter isn’t the only firm peddling doggie cuddles as part a wellness program: Gowling WLG, Norton Rose Fulbright and Eversheds Sutherland have launched similar programs.

That deserves a round of a-paws.

# Intellectual Property Firm Hands Out Above-Market Bonuses
## This doesn’t make up for not giving raises, but it’s a start.

UPDATE: Huge screw up on this one, and let me explain how it happened. During the salary raises over the summer, Fish & Richardson infamously declared that they would not raise salaries. However, in September [they reversed themselves and matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/biglaw-firm-reverses-course-on-associate-raises-is-now-onboard-with-190000-starting-salary/) — it was a story I didn’t write and something I missed in our archives. Still, it’s fair to say that the firm’s goodwill took a hit over the summer and that even a belated match hasn’t fully healed that wound of seeing the firm try to hold the line on salaries, but we do need to clarify that they have since matched. Sorry all.

Fish and Richardson hands out individualized bonuses making it harder to lock down exactly what everyone’s getting, but from the reports trickling into Above the Law, the firm is handing out better-than-market bonuses to at least some of its hard-working associates.

If that’s true across the board, it may go a ways toward rebuilding the firm’s goodwill with its associates which took a substantial hit over the summer. For those who don’t remember, Fish & Richardson bragged about its top-notch financials and then informed lawyers that [they would not be matching the new salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/biglaw-firm-tells-associates-they-can-afford-to-raise-salaries-but-theyre-still-not-going-to/). The firm claimed it was holding the line to maintain its comparatively humane 1900-hour billing target, but associates at the time complained to us that despite this target, the firm really requires billables in the 2100-hour range to secure a market bonus, meaning lawyers had to work harder to get bonuses that would still put them behind their peers.

But the reports of this bonus cycle suggest some adjustments may be underway to address this. Associates have reported sub-2000-hour years with slightly higher than Cravath bonuses. That bonus premium is a nice gesture. Hopefully these aren’t outliers.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477).

As pandemic realities continue to push technology to the forefront of the business world, how have law firms responded to the challenge?

To get the perspectives of those who know best, we conducted our second annual Biglaw Decision-Makers Survey this spring, together with our friends at Wolters Kluwer.

We asked partners and director-level staff about the importance of technology to various aspects of the firm’s business, the role clients play in tech-related decisions, and whether the firm is actually meeting its technology needs.

Their responses diverge from the prior year in ways that may surprise you — and shed light on tech’s evolving role.

# Salary Increases Could Lead To The Ruin Of Many Law Firms
## Are associate raises an act of self-harm?

[M]iddle law’s [defined as firms ranked about 40 to 120 by profits per equity partner (PPP)] incipient salary move is radically different. It’s not just that it’s avoidable or that it’s entirely self-inflicted. What makes it harrowing to watch is that it comes on the heels of middle law having done a stunning job of adjusting to the realities of the post-2007 world. Shifting the business model to lower cost and higher leverage made great strategic sense; these were hard-won gains.

The analogy with lemmings is unfair. Unfair, that is, to lemmings. Lemmings are herd migrators. They can swim. Occasionally when they migrate they dive into, and swim across, rivers. Their jumping off cliffs is apocryphal. Not even lemmings are a model for middle-law’s incipient plunge.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
—- Hugh A. Simons, former Biglaw senior partner and executive committee member at The Boston Consulting Group,[ writing for American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2018/06/12/the-associate-salary-arms-race-is-a-mass-act-of-self-harm/) that he believes firms following the leader in the [salary wars of 2018](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2018-associate-salary-increase/?rf=1) are headed toward destruction. Clients are taking more work in-house and increasing the use of alternate service providers — those trends mean most of the firms aren’t able to keep up with the Cravaths of the Biglaw world.

# Kirkland Has Spoken... Can We Now Declare The Salary Wars Over?
## The last best hope for a firm going over the top has merely matched.

When Cravath added the most recent wrinkle to the FrankenRaises Monster that is the Milbank/Simpson/Cravath associate salary scale, we mused that it [might not be enough](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/screw-cravath-whats-kirkland-going-to-do/) to get the very top of the Biglaw revenue machine to match. After all, the economics of Cravath issuing a raise for its relatively small number of associates is just different than those faced by Kirkland or Latham or DLA Piper.

But now we know that Cravath’s still got the magic. Kirkland has finally moved and they’ll be matching the Cravath scale.

Summers are getting money too, and everything’s taking effect as of July 1, just like everyone else. The firm is also prorating bonuses for attorneys who took leave or worked part-time at some point during the year. That’s a wrinkle. Unless that excludes maternity leave, that’s kind of annoying.

Kirkland associates have some thoughts:

KIRKLAND MATCHED MILBANK/SIMPSON/CRAVATH SCALE. NOW BACK TO THE GRINDER WE GO…

And…

Kirkland matches Cravath. Not impressed.

Well, Kirkland associates don’t need to despair too much — the firm is still known for its [above-market bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/kirkland-ellis-comes-to-play-with-above-market-bonuses/), and there’s no reason to believe that won’t continue. That’s why this move doesn’t impact Kirkland associates as much as it slams the door on the rest of Biglaw. Every firm who hadn’t moved still drifted to sleep with visions of $200K dancing in their heads. Now… those are gone.

Within the next week, every top-tier firm will match (or substantially match) this scale. Our salary wars are all but assuredly over, folks.

Enjoy $190K.

# Will Wilmer Match? Yes... And They Just Did
## Every match sends a signal.

Inevitably, whenever we’re in the depths of bonus season, there will be some reader who complains that all we talk about are bonuses. Where’s the funny story about some lawyer suspended for trying to bill out his dog as a paralegal? Isn’t there some trenchant commentary about a recent Supreme Court hearing that you can ignore in lieu of pointing out that [Clarence Thomas still thinks Nebraska is a top-flight football program?](https://twitter.com/rodger/status/1377275051322585088?s=20) To some extent, we are still writing those stories, they’re just buried under the deluge of bonus announcements. But if some slip by or get posted a day late, it’s because bonus news really is that important.

And these bonuses aren’t just a Biglaw story. The instant gratification of an announcement may inure only to the benefit of those associates, but it shapes the whole industry landscape. It might keep Biglaw associates from lateraling. Or it might encourage mid-levels to make that final loan payment and declare themselves open to lower-paying opportunities. It will trickle down to smaller firms trying to keep one standard of deviation behind the pack. In-house packages will change. The government will see turnover. It’s not an exaggeration to say that some firm is going to miss the boat on these bonuses and permanently mark themselves as sub-elite, while another will keep pace only to dissolve in a couple of years.

So, yes, we’re going to have to talk a lot about bonuses, because they’re not just paychecks. They’re symbolic of a whole lot more.

With that said, WilmerHale has matched the Davis Polk bonus scale. It’s backloaded with a May 25 and a September 25 payout. We don’t have a memo but this is basically what that looks like:

May	Sept.	Total
Class of 2020	$4,500	$7,500	$12,000
Class of 2019	$6,000	$10,000	$16,000
Class of 2018	$12,000	$20,000	$32,000
Class of 2017	$16,500	$27,500	$44,000
Class of 2016	$19,500	$32,500	$52,000
Class of 2015	$22,200	$37,000	$59,200
Class of 2014+	$24,000	$40,000	$64,000
One tipster reports of the bonus:

People are stoked – we knew the firm would match but thought that, in classic Wilmer fashion, we’d do it at the end of the rush when the firm would have to pay all the money but get none of the good will.

And that’s the whole thing, isn’t it? What do bonus announcements signal to the world? This far into the cycle, they really do indicate that a firm is a solid player but unwilling to stick its neck out. And that’s information that lawyers and clients can use.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Beating Cravath To The Punch On Bonuses: A Sign Of Market Confidence?
## Thus far, Milbank's bonus announcement has gone largely unmatched (ignored?) by other Biglaw firms.

The timing is sort of surprising. Obviously, there’s a war on talent. Firms want to be seen as an early leader in setting market rates, and it shows they feel confident in the market next year.

— [Nathan Peart](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/nathan-peart), managing director of Major, Lindsey & Africa’s associate practice group, commenting on [Milbank’s announcement of year-end bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/) yesterday. Not only did the firm beat Cravath to the punch, but this is the earliest that Biglaw bonuses have been announced [since 2009](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/11/breaking-cravath-bonuses-are-out-and-down/) (a time when bonus compensation was down, and the real bonus was still having a job).

I expect everyone who wants to come in will come on July 6. There will be more life in the office. With the summer class wanting to be there, we think it’s important to be there. …

We’ve been very clear to all the partners and to all the associates that no one should feel pressured to come in. We’re encouraging them [to return] on July 6 — assuming they’re fully vaccinated, that they’re comfortable traveling in the office and comfortable being there, and they make their own schedule.

— Joseph Shenker, chair of Sullivan & Cromwell, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2021/05/05/sullivan-cromwell-strongly-encouraging-july-office-return-405-83062/), countering Above the Law’s coverage on the [firm’s reopening plan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/prestigious-biglaw-firm-to-reopen-in-july-without-work-from-home-flexibility-sources-say/), where numerous associates reported that the plan was mandatory, that they were unhappy with it, and that remote work seemed like it would not be a possibility. Following Am Law’s interview with Shenker, additional associates reached out to ATL, with one source noting, “Everyone is angry and frustrated. We think it’s absurd and completely unmindful of our safety and need for flexibility as we still deal with pandemic-related constraints.” The firm did not, and still has not, responded to our requests for comment.

# Female Representation In Biglaw Partnerships — A Long Way to Go
## Disproportionate attrition of female attorneys in Biglaw is hardly a new problem.

Disproportionate attrition of female attorneys in Biglaw is hardly a new problem. As a 2019 ABA and ALM [report](https://www.americanbar.org/products/inv/book/391971040/) on the issue noted, “entering associate classes have been comprised of approximately 45% women for several decades.” Indeed, at five of the top 20 Am Law firms (by gross revenue), female lawyers now constitute a majority of associates:

Firm	% of Female Associates
Baker McKenzie	53.4%
Norton Rose Fulbright	53.0%
Morgan Lewis	50.8%
Hogan Lovells	50.1%
Jones Day	50.1%
But when it comes to partnerships, representation of women is substantially lower. Among those top 20 Am Law firms, here are the four with the greatest proportion of female partners:

Firm	% of Female Partners
Ropes & Gray	31.8%
Morgan Lewis	28.8%
Baker McKenzie	27.9%
Jones Day	27.3%
Ropes & Gray is the standout performer, as the only top 20 firm with greater than 30% female representation in its partnership. Interestingly, unlike the other firms in this table, Ropes & Gray does not rank especially highly for female associate representation: only 44.8% of the firm’s associates are women.

And here are the four with the lowest female representation in the partnership:

Firm	% of Female Partners
Gibson Dunn	20.9%
White & Case	20.8%
Simpson Thacher	20.2%
Davis Polk	17.9%
Gibson Dunn is an interesting case in that the firm last year elected its first-ever female Chair, Barbara Becker. Gibson Dunn’s [announcement](https://www.gibsondunn.com/gibson-dunn-elects-new-york-ma-lawyer-barbara-becker-as-chair-and-managing-partner/) of the appointment emphasized diversity and inclusion, noting that Ms. Becker created the firmwide Diversity Committee. It will be interesting to see if Ms. Becker succeeds in boosting the firm’s female partner representation above the current below-average level.

Any way you cut it, Biglaw certainly has a long way to go. Should that be cause for despair? Not necessarily. The good news is that firms are well aware of the problem and at least some of them are making a strong push to fix it, even if progress is slower than we would wish.

How to increase female representation — and retain female partners

There are a number of ways that law firms are pushing to increase female representation in their partnerships. Flexibility is a key theme. Many female Biglaw attorneys are working mothers with other schedules to meet outside of work. A one-size-fits-all approach to hours expectations (including office presence, billable hours, and business development targets) can disproportionately drive away women. We speak to many high-powered female attorneys who feel compelled to leave the law firm grind because they also want to raise a family, and they have concluded that it is impossible to succeed at both. When law firms incorporate more women- and family-friendly policies firmwide (not just for partners!) it paves the way for female associates to first rise to the equity partnership and then succeed there — both inside and outside the office.

Increasing female representation in partnerships is not enough. Law firms must also offer a solid support structure so as to not leave women high and dry once they attain equity status. Providing adequate and equitable associate and administrative support goes a long way in retaining female partners and promoting their longevity. In addition, establishing vibrant Women’s Initiatives with strong leadership and defined budgets is one way to support female partnership (and all female attorneys).  And don’t forget the men — they need to be involved!  Male participation in Women’s Initiatives is crucial in demonstrating that the entire firm stands behind a diverse partnership and supports female advancement.  

Pitfalls to keep in mind

Law firms should be careful not to simply promote women to non-equity partner status and assume that’s good enough. Not all partnership roles are created equal. These days, so many firms have deviated from the one-tier structure of partnership, such that non-equity partnership often amounts to what used to be called Counsel. When there are several tiers of partnership, it creates additional obstacles to attaining the ultimate goal of equity.

Law firm leadership should also be aware that non-billable requirements often disproportionately take women away from billable work as compared to their male counterparts. For example, for some reason female attorneys are especially likely to participate on committees. Women’s Initiatives and other firm programs are important, but they present a Catch-22 that must be acknowledged and monitored. Firms should be careful not to unfairly assign a disproportionate amount of non-billable tasks to female partners or just assume they will take on an extra load. This is something we often hear our female candidates complain about, and it is an easy fix once the problem has been identified. But firm leadership must first be cognizant of the pattern.

# Biglaw Firm Wants Out Because Pharma Bro Martin Shkreli Can't Pay His Bills
## Biglaw means big bills -- and Shkreli doesn't have the money to pay them.

Martin Shkreli (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty)

Things have really taken a turn for Martin Shkreli. The once successful pharmaceutical executive, hedge fund founder, and owner of a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album earned the world’s hate and the nickname “pharma bro” after hiking up the price of the lifesaving drug Daraprim from $17.50 to $750 overnight.

Then came the lawsuits (numerous) and the jailtime (seven years), and now he’s so broke he can’t even pay his law firm’s legal fees.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Duane Morris, the firm that defended Shkreli against antitrust charges, recently asked a federal judge for permission to withdraw from representing their client, citing the fact that his outstanding bills haven’t been paid.

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/martin-shkrelis-law-firm-has-not-been-paid-seeks-withdraw-2022-04-12/) has the details on Shkreli’s continued fall from grace:

Duane Morris LLP said Shkreli’s former company Phoenixus AG agreed to cover his legal fees but has refused to pay the $2.04 million owed through March 31, after exhausting the limits of an insurance policy covering the fees in October.

In a filing in Manhattan federal court, Duane Morris also said Shkreli “has no assets” to pay its fees, and would not be harmed if it withdrew because the antitrust trial is over. The law firm said Shkreli did not oppose its withdrawal.

As Method Man once said, “Behind every fortune, there’s a crime.” Shkreli now seems to know that all too well — and he “has no assets” because of it. Ouch.

# Friday Afternoon Fun With Instagram

It’s been a while since we checked in with[ our favorite legally themed Instagram account](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/an-instagram-must-for-attorneys/), @[attorneyproblems](https://www.instagram.com/attorneyproblems/). And what better distraction on a Friday afternoon, as you patiently wait for it to be late enough to blow your Biglaw popsicle stand — all the while praying you don’t get that dreaded late afternoon call that means you’ll have to work all weekend.

Best of luck dodging that bullet, and maybe a few laughs will help pass the time.

# Top 30 Biglaw Firm Wishes Associates A Happy Hump Day By Announcing Bonuses -- Plus Extra Cash For High Billers
## A nice bonus treat for associates this morning.

It’s Wednesday. We’re so close to the weekend, and yet, so far. Ugh. What’s the best way to get associates over the hump and in the right frame of mind? This Biglaw firm knows.

Covington & Burling — a firm that brought in $1,501,130,000 gross revenue in 2021 — announced market bonuses bright and early this morning, which was sure to put a smile on many associates’ faces. Here’s what that bonus scale looks like:

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015+: $115,000
The firm’s management committee also announced that the bonus scale would be increased by 10% for associates whose hours exceed the 2200 mark, and by another 10% for associates whose hours exceed the 2400 mark. That’s a very nice bonus haul for hardworking associates.

Those who are bonus-eligible will receive their cash by the end of January 2023. Congratulations on your bonuses, Covington associates!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Covington & Burling.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

The D.C. litigation boutique of [Robbins, Russell, Englert, Orseck, Untereiner & Sauber LLP](http://www.robbinsrussell.com/) has come to play. The firm announced this afternoon they are increasing associate compensation, matching the Cravath scale for all associates.

The firm is noted for its trial and appellate work, and proves what we here at Above the Law have been saying since the salary grid was announced last week — the ability to pay associates this new market salary has nothing to do with a firm’s headcount. Indeed, the [very first firm we reported as matching the Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-firm-bumps-associate-salaries-to-match-180k-scale/) was a boutique, Hueston Hennigan, who made the move the very same day.

The raises range from $20K-$35K, depending on class year, and are effective July 1. Here’s the memo from partner [Jennifer S. Windom](http://www.robbinsrussell.com/attorneys/jennifer-s-windom):

Yesterday, US District Judge Christopher R. Cooper denied attorney Michael Sussmann’s motion to dismiss the false statement charge against him brought by Special Counsel John Durham.

Sussmann, formerly of Perkins Coie, represented the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton campaign, and [cybersecurity expert](https://nypost.com/2021/09/30/who-is-rodney-joffe-tech-executive-1-in-durham-indictment/) Rodney Joffe. After Russian hackers infiltrated DNC servers, Joffe’s company Neustar was part of a group tasked with monitoring internet traffic to see if other sensitive sites were under attack, which is how they came to discover weird pings between a server in Trump Tower and a Russian bank. He [did not](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/dnc-lawyer-michael-sussmann-fires-back-at-special-counsel-durham/), as Trump and his acolytes have [suggested](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/17/jesse-watters/jesse-watters-spins-facts-beyond-recognition-claim/), “hack” the White House.

The “Alfa Bank” story appeared in October of 2016 in [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html), but a month before that, Sussmann approached FBI general counsel James Baker with data that could fairly be described as “massaged” to suggest something nefarious about the traffic between the Trump server and a Russian bank — not that what he said wasn’t true, but perhaps it was spun. Whatever the case, five minutes before the statute of limitations expired, John Durham, who has spent three years trying to prove there was something illegal about the origin of the Russia investigation, indicted Sussmann on one count of lying to the FBI.

But not for lying about the data — Sussmann was charged with lying about whom he represented at the meeting. According to the indictment, Sussmann told Baker that he wasn’t there on behalf of a particular client. He later billed the meeting to the Clinton campaign, although he was on retainer with it, so the economic effect was nil.

It seems highly unlikely that anyone in DC could have failed to realize that Perkins Coie represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign. And indeed the only evidence that Sussmann failed to disclose it during the meeting is in notes on the handoff call to Baker’s deputy Bill Priestap taken after the meeting.

“Said not doing this for any client,” Priestap wrote, followed immediately by “Represents DNC, Clinton Foundation, etc.”

Baker testified to Congress that it would have made no difference to the investigation if Sussmann had disclosed that he was there on behalf of a client — or multiple clients, which is one possible interpretation of the phrase “not here on behalf of a particular client.” And indeed Sussmann pointed this out in his [motion to dismiss](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.235638/gov.uscourts.dcd.235638.39.0_5.pdf) the case, arguing that his lie, if indeed it was a lie, fails to satisfy the materiality requirement under 18 U.S. Code § 1001.

But Judge Cooper disagreed, finding that materiality is an issue of fact for the jury.

“As the Special Counsel argues, it is at least possible that statements made to law enforcement prior to an investigation could materially influence the later trajectory of the investigation. Sussmann offers no legal authority to the contrary,” he [wrote](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.235638/gov.uscourts.dcd.235638.67.0_13.pdf). “Whether Sussmann’s alleged statement was in fact capable of influencing either the commencement or the later conduct of the FBI’s investigation is a very different question, and one that the parties hotly dispute.”

“The battle lines thus are drawn, but the Court cannot resolve this standoff prior to trial,” Judge Cooper concluded, adding that “while Sussmann is correct that certain statements might be so peripheral or unimportant to a relevant agency decision or function to be immaterial under § 1001 as matter of law, the Court is unable to make that determination as to this alleged statement before hearing the government’s evidence. ”

The case will go to trial on May16 in DC. After which Durham will finally arrest Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Podesta, the DNC, and probably Nancy Pelosi and send them all to Gitmo.

Or, you know, maybe not.

Well, this is a trend we can get behind. Fresh off the news that [Fenwick & West stepped up](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-firm-wows-with-new-parental-leave-policy/) with some impressive parental benefits, a tipster reached out with some exciting details about the parental leave being offered at White & Case.

Effective January 2018, the firm now offers 12 weeks paid leave for all Legal and Business Services employees who are new parents following the birth or placement of a child. The policy applies regardless of gender or primary caregiver status. This is in addition to disability leave for birthing mothers, which is typically 8-10 weeks.

One of the best features of the firm’s new program is the flexibility it provides. The new leave program allows new parents to take the time off consecutively or intermittently in a minimum of one-day increments, at any point in the first 12 months. Additionally, for parents who are adopting or fostering children, leave can be taken prior to the placement in order to ease the process.

Earlier this week, news quickly began to spread about the [violent shooting death](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/biglaw-practice-leader-shot-and-killed-in-domestic-dispute/) of [Stephen Shapiro](https://www.mayerbrown.com/people/stephen-m-shapiro/), the founder of Mayer Brown’s Supreme Court and appellate practice. Shapiro was shot and killed in his Chicago-area suburban home on Monday night, and after the suspect fled the scene, he was arrested following a brief SWAT standoff at his apartment.

That suspect, John Gately III, 66, was [formally charged](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-met-northfield-shooting-charges-20180815-story.html) last night with first-degree murder and attempted homicide. Although police have not yet confirmed the relationship between the two men, they were correct in that this was indeed a domestic-related shooting: Gately is Shapiro’s brother-in-law. According to the report from the Cook County Medical Examiner that classified Shapiro’s death as a homicide, the Supreme Court scholar suffered multiple gunshot wounds.

Stephen M. Shapiro

Shapiro has been [remembered](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/08/14/mayer-brown-partners-killing-shocks-colleagues-appellate-bar/) by his colleagues as a “one of the greatest advocates of our day,” “a cherished mentor, a dear friend, and a superb lawyer” who “literally wrote the book on Supreme Court advocacy.”

Shapiro is [survived](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/08/14/mayer-brown-partners-killing-shocks-colleagues-appellate-bar/) by his wife, Joan Gately Shapiro, and daughter, [Dorothy Shapiro Lund](https://gould.usc.edu/faculty/?id=74409), a former Sullivan & Cromwell associate who now works as an assistant professor at the USC Gould School of Law. Shapiro’s son-in-law, [Oren Lund](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oren-lund-48288016/), recently left the partnership at Kirkland & Ellis to join Massumi + Consoli, a private equity and M&A boutique. He was predeceased in 2015 by his son, Michael Shapiro, a comedian.

Gately is scheduled to appear for a bond hearing today in Skokie, Illinois.

# Biglaw Firm Conducts Layoffs, Citing 'Excess Capacity'
## The firm is trying to rightsize itself.

Despite predictions of an onslaught of layoffs within the legal industry, all has been relatively quiet on the job loss front. Perhaps it’s been a little too quiet. As it turns out, law firm leaders are still quite worried about the economy, and layoffs are still lurking among us. In fact, an Am Law 100 firm quietly conducted a round of layoffs earlier this week.

Davis Wright Tremaine — a firm that pulled in $482,140,000 gross revenue in 2021, landing it in 89th place on the Am Law 100 — has laid off laid off 21 professional staff members, citing the need to “better align [the firm’s] capabilities and capacity with current and anticipated workflows.”

Firmwide managing partner [Scott MacCormack](https://www.dwt.com/people/m/maccormack-scott-w) discussed the layoffs in a memo to all employees:

Transparency is a critical element of our distinctive culture, and I want all of you to have some insight into what led to this action.

We have excess capacity in some areas and, with the way we work continuing to evolve, we have some redundancy and misalignment around the skills and capabilities we need to serve our clients.

Given the economic climate, we are making these changes now to enable us to make investments in capabilities that we need in areas of strategic importance or high demand.

Per MacCormack, the staff who are being guided away from the firm will receive severance packages as well as the support of outplacement services. Best of luck to those who are being let go from Davis Wright Tremaine.

“I’ve been kicked when I was down / None of that sh*t matters now / They be throwing in the towel / I do yellowtail at TAO.” — [Drake](https://genius.com/14882838)

The Women’s Bar Association of Massachusetts, in partnership with the Rikleen Institute for Strategic Leadership, recently [announced the results](https://wbawbf.org/content/press-release-wba-workplace-survey-results) of its groundbreaking [Survey of Workplace Conduct and Behaviors in Law Firms](https://wbawbf.org/sites/default/files/WBA%20Survey%20of%20Workplace%20Conduct%20and%20Behaviors%20in%20Law%20Firms%20FINAL.pdf).

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In the wake of the #MeToo movement, this is an excellent piece to better understand negative behaviors, identify steps  to address behaviors of concern, and review recommendations for law firms to provide a safe, respectful, and inclusive workplace for all employees.

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to catch up with the report’s author, Lauren Stiller Rikleen, a former law firm partner and current president of the Rikleen Institute for Strategic Leadership. Back in the spring, I had the opportunity to speak with her at the [Legal Inclusiveness & Diversity Conference](http://summit.centerforlegalinclusiveness.org/) in Denver, CO.

Her detailed presentation at the diversity conference about millennial behavior and attitudes in the workplace was engaging and insightful. It is no surprise her recently published report also provides illuminating details to systematic behavior and attitudes taking place in the law firm work environment. One theme consistent throughout the research was how unchecked power imbalance in a work environment perpetuates negative and inappropriate behaviors in the workplace.

Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Renwei Chung (RC): For those who haven’t read your report yet, what are the key recommendations that law firms should implement?

Lauren Rikleen (LR): The report had [17 recommendations](https://wbawbf.org/sites/default/files/WBA%20Survey%20of%20Workplace%20Conduct%20and%20Behaviors%20in%20Law%20Firms%20FINAL.pdf), all of which are critical to fully addressing this challenge. Among the most critical are:

1. Engage leadership in creating a firm culture that treats all with civility and respect. You cannot change culture without direct leadership involvement. When people see negative behaviors they assume that the leaders, too, must know and are accepting — otherwise, something would have been done to fix the problem. That causes a culture of frustration and lessened engagement. Only leaders can implement meaningful policies that will result in change.

2. Implement measures to hold firm leaders accountable for the behaviors of those they supervise and manage. Law firms track what they think matters — billable hours, collections, originations, and yield. Only when firms are willing to implement metrics for other key institutional challenges will real change happen. For example, firms should track reports of negative behaviors, attrition rates by department and office location, and other ways in which workplace culture impacts morale, engagement, and productivity.

3. Develop a comprehensive strategy that goes beyond sexual harassment training to avoid liability. In our survey, nearly 40 percent of the respondents did not even know whether their firm had a reporting process. Firms need a reporting process that protects the safety of the individual reporting and commits to a process free of retribution or other negative consequences. Lines of authority should be clearly explained through regular firm-wide training that clearly explains the policy and process for addressing negative behaviors and describes how the person reporting will be protected.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
RC: What advice do you have for a woman who has experienced a recent incident? 

LR:  The survey described a range of behaviors occurring in firms of all sizes, some of which had no policy in place and, in other instances, the perpetrator was a key leader. Others had a policy but within a culture where the risk of retribution for reporting was high.

My default is that nothing can ever change if leaders do not know there is a problem. But first, it is important to assess the circumstances. Is this an incident that may best be handled through a direct conversation, or through the assistance of an intermediary? Or did the circumstances cross a line such that bringing the behavior to light is the only likely hope of stopping someone from repeating the conduct?

Is the perpetrator a key leader within the firm? Does the firm have a history of addressing these issues, either positively or negatively? Is there a process for reporting?  Is there a trusted person who can guide you through an investigation once you report? Can you rely on an outside counsel to assist, in the event reporting goes awry?

I believe we all have a duty to bring these issues to light, but recognize that individuals will always be concerned about their circumstances. As a general rule, however, I think people tend to underestimate their own power to move forward and address the issue.

RC: What do you think are the biggest challenges revealed in the report that need to be addressed?

LR: As we noted in the report, unchecked power imbalance serves as the foundation for and perpetuation of negative and inappropriate behaviors. In the vast majority of the responses, the incidents described happened to individuals in the age range of associates, or who were otherwise in a subordinate role. Often, the perpetrator was a partner who was a senior leader, a rainmaker, or someone of influence within the firm.

Also, the behaviors extended into bullying, humiliating, and even, as some respondents described, incidents that felt like hazing. Firms need to take a far more comprehensive approach to training in a way that moves beyond simply teaching the letter of the law, but also includes elements of unconscious bias, behavioral science research, bystander intervention, and other strategies that show a firm-wide holistic approach to developing a respectful and inclusive workplace.

# Permanent Remote Associate Positions For Biglaw Would Ease The Pain Of Returning To The Office
## Some associates are itching for programs like these to move from fantasy to reality ASAP.

There will be no way around a return. Eventually firms will force it to happen, and even if they didn’t, we might end up with some kind of double culture—where there are people who want to go into the office and people who would prefer not to.

You’re going to have to go back. Unless permanent remote positions start being offered, and it becomes more common in the legal industry. And if that happened, I think the firms who offer those positions will have a huge recruitment advantage.

— an anonymous fifth-year associate at an Am Law 200 firm, offering his thoughts on the [reopening of law firms and a return to office life](https://www.law.com/2021/05/19/associates-split-on-generational-lines-over-office-returns/) in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. For what it’s worth, this associate does not want to return to the office. “I simply do my best work at home,” he said. “I don’t feel my contribution is limited by my lack of presence in the office—in fact, I think it is heightened.”

It looks like intestines, but it’s actually a painting called ‘Wavelength’ by Steven Cushner, part of the Hogan Lovells collection (photo via the Washington Business Journal).

I can only speak for our clients, but I’ve always wanted them to buy fewer, better artworks. And this has given me a way to actually press for that.

— [Jean Efron](http://www.efronart.com/), an art consultant who works with D.C. law firms, commenting to the [Washington Business Journal](http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/top-shelf/2016/03/at-long-last-law-firms-develop-a-taste-for-the.html) about how space constraints in newer Biglaw offices have caused firms to acquire fewer (but higher-quality) pieces.

# The Top 10 Most Family-Friendly Law Firms (2016)
## Did your firm make the cut for this year's prestigious list?

Year in and year out, many large law firms give a lot of lip service to work/life balance, but at some firms, it is, in fact, possible to be an attorney with a family. At some of these firms, new parents are actually allowed to be parents thanks to generous parental leave policies and part-time and flex-time working arrangements. But which firms are the best when it comes to these policies?

Earlier this week, the Yale Law Women came out with their annual list of the top ten family-friendly firms. We cover this list every year (see our posts from [2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2015/), [2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/the-top-ten-family-friendly-law-firms-2014/),[2013](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/04/the-top-ten-family-friendly-law-firms-2013/), [2012](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/04/the-2012-top-ten-family-friendly-firms-according-to-yale-law/), [2011](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/top-ten-family-friendly-firms-according-to-yale-law-women/), [2010](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/05/family-friendly-law-firms/), [2009](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/08/yale-law-women-anoint-top-ten-family-friendly-firms/), and [2008](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/09/non-sequiturs-09-08-08/)). How has this list changed year over year? Which firms made the cut in 2016? Which firms had the best options available to both women and men? Let’s take a look at the latest ranking for the most family-friendly firms.

Here’s the list of the most family-friendly firms according to Yale Law Women:

- Arnold & Porter
- Foley Hoag
- Foley & Lardner
- Goodwin Procter
- K&L Gates
- Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo
- O’Melveny & Myers
- Morrison & Foerster
- Vinson & Elkins
- WilmerHale
In 2016, the following firms were booted from the list after having made an appearance last year: Cadwalader, Duane Morris, Hogan Lovells, Hunton & Williams, Kirkland & Ellis, Munger Tolles, and Orrick. That’s more than half of last year’s honorees. What on earth could have happened at these firms for them to be axed from the list?

The three returning firms are Arnold & Porter (an institution on this list; it’s been recognized every year since we began our coverage), MoFo (honored for the third year in a row), and WilmerHale (honored for the second year in a row after an absence in 2013 and 2014; previously, the firm was on the YLW list from 2009 to 2012). These three firms are joined by Foley Hoag, Foley & Lardner, Goodwin Procter, K&L Gates, Mintz Levin, O’Melveny, and Vinson & Elkins (returning to the list after dropping off last year).

Here’s a round-up of useful information about some of the YLW study’s findings:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
- Part-Time & Flex-Time Policies – Among participating firms, at least 65% of offices had attorneys who made partner in the last 5 years were currently working or had previously worked part-time or flexible full-time schedules.
- Family Leave – Many law firms adhere to an emerging industry norm of offering 18 weeks for primary caregivers and ­­4 weeks for secondary caregivers, but eligibility for leave varies.
- Gender Equity – Among participating firms, 45% of associates were women, and 21% of partners were women.
- Bonuses & Billing – 49% of participating firms required full-time associates to work a minimum number of billable hours to receive a bonus; for those firms, the median minimum was 1,950.
- Professional Development – At least 48% of participating firms used upward reviews to evaluate and provide feedback to supervising lawyers, and all firms had a coaching/mentoring program.
The Yale Law Women have been conducting this study for 11 years, and while vast improvements have been made in terms of parental accommodations offerings in that time, there is still a lot of work to be done. We said this last year, but it bears repeating in a world where Biglaw parents are having a tough time being parents to their children: “The legal profession has come a long way in terms of attempting to afford equal opportunities for success for both men and women, but it’s still got a long way to go. Why are lawyers still hurrying up and waiting for change? We shouldn’t be applauding a system that, in most cases, penalizes parents.”

Demand the change that you need now, and keep raising the issue until your requests are heard. There is power in numbers, and Biglaw firms will eventually be forced to listen to those who crave time with their families — without facing professional repercussions.

# Biglaw Firms Have Too Many Lawyers With Attorney Productivity At An Historic Low
## Though most firms aren't planning on doing anything about it... yet.

Bloated is not, generally speaking, a good word. It feels uncomfortable at that time of the month, it sounds awful when we’re talking about corpses, and it’s downright terrifying for associates when law firms start talking about it in terms of their headcount.

A survey conducted by Wells Fargo’s Legal Specialty Group found for the first six months of 2023, headcount is up in the legal sector, but productivity is down. Survey participants include 130 firms, including 66 Am Law 100 firms, and they said lawyer headcount is up 3.9 percent but demand is down, leading to a decline in productivity to the tune of 4.1 percent. Though, at the moment, layoffs and associate deferrals seem limited, with most firms opting to wait out the demand drop.

Owen Burman, a senior consultant at Wells Fargo, [said ](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/us-law-firms-face-continued-financial-challenges-after-productivity-declines-new-2023-08-21/) when it comes to billable hours, “We’ve never seen numbers this low.” The survey found an annualized pace of just 1,538 billable hours per lawyer. The 2021 mid-year report results saw average billable hours of 1,688, which was a high water mark. However, this year’s billables are also down from the 1,631 average in 2019 and 2018.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Overall, participating firms saw an uptick — 4.4 percent — in revenue. With demand down, this has come from an increase in billing rates. According to the report, it is “some of the highest growth in billing rates we’ve seen, 7.7% overall.”

For associates’ sake, this will hopefully provide the cushion firms need to weather the historically low productivity.

# Some Benefits Of Working Lower-Paid Firm Jobs
## People may trade a higher salary for the ability to gain valuable experience at a smaller shop.

This website has discussed at length how some of the largest law firms across the country have raised salaries recently as the top shops compete against each other for talent. First-year associates at top law firms now make eye-popping salaries that make them some of the highest-paid young professionals in the country. However, most people do not work in Biglaw and are not paid anywhere near as much as individuals who work at Biglaw shops. After leaving Biglaw, I spent the majority of career working at smaller law firms before beginning my own practice over three years ago. Sometimes, a number of benefits make working lower-paid firm jobs more attractive than those at a Biglaw shop with higher salaries.

Hands-On Legal Experience

Usually, the smaller the law firm an associate works at, the more hands-on experience the associate will get in the practice of law. Associates in Biglaw rarely get to go to court, take depositions, or complete many of the hands-on tasks of practicing law. This is because the stakes are higher for many cases handled by Biglaw shops, and clients want the top brass handling those matters.

Smaller law firms often handle smaller cases in which clients are less concerned with which lawyer is handling a matter, especially if the more junior lawyer charges a lower hourly rate. At the interview for my first job after Biglaw, the managing partner said he couldn’t pay me even half the salary I earned in Biglaw, but he promised I’d be in court my first week at the job and taking depositions my first month. He was correct, and I was actually in court three or four times a week at that job, and I also got to argue appeals, conduct class-action fairness hearings, and complete other hands-on tasks I would have never completed as an associate in Biglaw. This experience was critical to me when I was deciding whether I had the background to start my own shop, and people may trade a higher salary for the ability to gain this valuable experience.

Work-Life Balance

Attorneys at smaller law firms generally have a better work-life balance than attorneys who work at larger firms. The more a firm pays an attorney, the more a firm expects that an attorney will be indebted to the firm to give up nights, weekends, and other personal time in order to complete work tasks. However, the opposite is true at smaller firms. Since the shop is not paying associates as much, a typical tradeoff is that work-life balance is respected.

One time when I was working at a smaller firm, my boss needed to send me something over the weekend since an emergent matter needed to be handled first thing on Monday morning. The boss was so profusely sorry that he interrupted me over the weekend, and I think that was the only time in two years I ever needed to log on after business hours in order to complete tasks. At that firm, everyone also took a full two weeks of vacation at least every year and around the holidays both years I worked at that firm, I took most of the second half of December completely off, which was an amazing experience. Of course, there are exceptions to most rules, but by and large, smaller firms respect work-life balance more than shops that expect associates to toil at all times of the day or night because they are getting paid high salaries.

Less Crap From Bosses

This is not always the case, and many lower-paid jobs have managers that make associate lives miserable. However, in my personal experience, the less money I made at a job, the less crap I generally needed to deal with from a boss. This was likely because there was so much turnover at some of the shops at which I worked that had lower salaries that managers knew they had to treat associates better or else associates would vote with their feet and go elsewhere, causing interruptions at the firm.

Moreover, in my experience, associates could talk back to managers much more at lower-paid jobs than at higher-paid ones. I had a few managers at the lower-paid job that routinely made my life miserable, even though they were often wrong about legal matters and strategies. After a few months at that firm, I became pretty bold with talking back to bosses and letting them know when I disagreed, and dishing whatever disrespect they were giving to me. One time, a partner even yelled at me to get out of his office after I got into a disagreement with him (in which I ended up being right!) and there were no consequences for my comments. If I was making more money, I probably would have cared more about that job, and the partners would have believed they could have easily replaced me, such that this approach would not be tolerated.

All told, money makes things easier, and lawyers should generally gravitate toward jobs that pay them more money. However, attorneys should be aware of certain benefits that are experienced by associates who work lower-paid firm jobs.

The taping itself was so much more fun that I imagined. It occurred to me that the guest host for my segment could be Ken Jennings, who is someone I’ve adored for so many years. It turned out he was, and spending a little bit of time with him and the Clue Crew personally was a dream come true.

One thing that was amazingly cool to see was how scrupulous the show is about the ethics and confidentiality of the game. There’s always a lawyer on set … and I’m hoping that’ll be my next job!

— [Willa Perlmutter](https://www.stoel.com/people/willa-b-perlmutter), chair of the occupational safety and health act group at Stoel Rives, commenting on her [recent “Jeopardy!” appearance](https://www.law.com/2021/11/12/stoel-rives-lawyer-shows-off-inner-smarty-pants-on-jeopardy/). Perlmutter came in second place on the show, and brought home $1,700 in prize money.

# Jones Day Advertising Its Trump Admin Ties Because They Have No Shame

Donald Trump (by Gage Skidmore via Wikimedia)

Is Donald Trump infectious? I don’t mean, “is he a vector for syphilis?” — though, hell, that would hardly shock me. I’m not even talking about “Donald Trump” the individual. I mean, is the phenomenon of “Donald Trump” in all its tacky, shameless self-promotion an infectious condition? Because it seems as though entering the man’s orbit turns everyone into desperate attention whores willing to push the very envelope of propriety to get one additional morsel of notoriety.

Steve Bannon cast himself as the bloated rock god of nativism until Trump’s whims pushed him to the margins. Jared Kushner might not talk much, but these hot takes about the ascending influence of the phenomenally unqualified NYU Law grad aren’t sprouting from nowhere — that’s the end result of a diligent public relations campaign. Mike Pence [mugged like the foreign relations novice that he is](http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/mike-pence-is-a-fucking-joke-1794495680#_ga=1.59950829.1561608609.1485276400) in an effort to spark a devastating conflagration.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But certainly there’s no way that a law firm deeply ensconced within the administration, like, oh I don’t know, Jones Day, would try to capitalize on that with an ad campaign asymptotically approaching the appearance of influence-peddling! Indeed, just last month, in a [Big Law Business podcast](https://bol.bna.com/jones-day-podcast/), Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek cited our own David Lat to assure everyone that no law firm would go down that road (around the 8:17 mark):

I think David is probably right that some clients will think they have an open line to the Trump administration via Jones Day. Of course, if Jones Day were to in any way cooperate with that, that would be entirely inappropriate and possibly illegal, if they basically sold their services as intermediaries to particular people in the Trump administration. So I think you may see some less sophisticated clients who would think that this is a good way to get an in with the administration, and more sophisticated clients would probably steer clear of that kind of thing.

Well, Jones Day has asked Barrett to hold its proverbial beer.

This ad, discussed in [Politico this morning](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/25/playbook-juice-ubs-investor-watch-trump-237561), is cropping up around the Internet:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


As Politico [points out](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/25/playbook-juice-ubs-investor-watch-trump-237561), former Jones Day partner Don McGahn is [now White House Counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-partner-to-be-trump-administrations-white-house-counsel/), JD was paid $3.3 million in legal fees by the Trump campaign, and several other lawyers from the firm have [moved over to the White House](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/jones-day-in-the-white-house-the-biglaw-firm-fills-top-jobs-in-the-trump-administration/).

Now, in fairness to Jones Day, the firm doesn’t go so far as to say “our lawyers are all over this administration” in a way that conveys that Jones Day is in any way getting a sweetheart deal from the administration. Jones Day knows better than to make such a representation and — presumably — their former colleagues in positions of influence also know enough not to entangle themselves in improprieties. After all, as Politico notes, Jones Day does not lobby in Washington — yet — limiting the possible impact of these connections.

On the other hand, a firm that is all over the mainstream national media as the favored law firm of the Trump administration is now marketing itself as a firm that knows a lot about the Trump administration. It’s not like this ad touts the firm’s “top-notch regulatory practice,” it calls out their “insights on the new administration.” If you’re a client with the financial wherewithal to hire a firm like Jones Day, one would assume you’re savvy enough to connect the very thinly veiled dots.

Jones Day has insights into Energy policy? Could it have anything to do with [Kevin McIntyre chairing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-03-08/lawyer-mcintyre-said-to-be-trump-s-pick-to-lead-energy-regulator)? And those trade policy insights certainly have nothing to do with James Uthmeier serving as Special Advisor to the Secretary of Commerce. Not to mention the veritable army of (inevitably temporarily) former Jones Day partners working the West Wing, the Justice Department, and various other agencies.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s not like the revolving door is anything new. Debevoise is on [the receiving end of the cycle](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/business/dealbook/where-have-the-prosecutors-gone-try-debevoise-plimpton.html) right now. Some institutional clients are eager to work with a firm that they perceive as having an “in” with people of influence. But no one advertises it for a reason. As the Paul Barrett quote says, law firms historically work overtime to disabuse clients of these notions.

Jones Day has opted to flag them. Barrett thinks it’s the “less sophisticated clients” that think in these terms, and regardless of how they actually conduct their business, Jones Day is marketing itself to this lower common denominator. For a firm that’s faced a [literal voter outcry](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/jones-day-responds-to-critics-with-standard-petulant-hissy-fit/) over the perception that they’ve enriched themselves on taxpayer dimes, playing up the outsized influence of their old co-workers upon the administration is a bold look.

No, let’s go back to the first paragraph here: it’s not a bold look, it’s a tacky look. It’s a tacky, tasteless, bush league look.

But if we’ve learned anything in the last 100 days, it’s that negative attention is still attention, and that’s what really matters.

[](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/robert-rabalais-from-simpson-thacher-bartlett-episode-4)If you’re interested in the world of large law firms, aka Biglaw — and if you’re reading Above the Law, you probably are — then you might want to check out [Book of Business](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/), the Biglaw-centric podcast that I’m doing with veteran legal recruiter Robert Kinney, Founder and President of [Kinney Recruiting](http://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/).

In each episode, Robert and I do three things. First, we analyze a recent notable lateral move or collection of moves. Second, we take an in-depth look at a specific legal market. Finally, we offer career advice for the audience of Book of Business — current and aspiring partners at leading law firms.

In our [latest installment](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/robert-rabalais-from-simpson-thacher-bartlett-episode-4), our fourth, we welcome a special guest: [Robert René Rabalais](https://www.stblaw.com/our-team/partners/robert-ren%C3%A9-rabalais), a leading energy lawyer and the founding partner of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett’s office in Houston, which he launched in 2011. We chat with Robert about what drew STB to Houston, the Houston legal market overall, and his advice on business development.

If you’re a partner at a leading law firm who might be interested in joining us on the podcast, please feel free to email me and Robert Kinney, subject line “Book of Business.” I can be reached at [dlat@abovethelaw.com](mailto:dlat@abovethelaw.com?subject=Book%20of%20Business), and Robert Kinney can be reached at [robert@kinneyrecruiting.com](mailto:robert@kinneyrecruiting.com?subject=Book%20of%20Business).

Back in May 2016, I examined how and why Canadian and American attorneys consider becoming expats. A lot has happened since the first installment of [“Oh Canada! Lateral Moves to And From Our Northern Neighbors,” ](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/oh-canada-lateral-moves-to-and-from-our-northern-neighbors/)and it is time for a sequel!

In Part II, I will tackle some of the questions I continue to receive from candidates contemplating a move cross-border. Specifically, I explain what the process involves, identify potential hurdles, and explain how to overcome them to land the ideal job.

Question: Are U.S. law firms still hiring Canadians? Resounding YES!

Over the past two years, I have noticed a rise in Am Law 100 firms opening their doors to Canadian lawyers. Recruiting a star midlevel associate has become increasingly difficult, and many law firms have turned to Canadian candidates to fill the void.

Class-Cuts

Canadian lawyers entering the U.S. legal market should expect their graduating class year to be pared down. The number of class years subtracted from a given candidate will depend on the specific individual and their experience. Typically, my junior candidates take a haircut of 1-2 years, while my senior candidates are a little less predictable, as their prior work experience more strongly dictates their awarded class year.

Bar Exam

As I discussed in Part 1, candidates are expected to be admitted in the jurisdiction to which they are relocating. However, it is worth nothing that Canadian JD’s are not eligible to sit for the bar in all 50 U.S. states. Consequently, it is crucial to consult with the relevant State Bar Association to determine your eligibility, as this can be a major hurdle when applying for a job in the U.S.

Ideal Time to Move

There is no “ideal” time to move. I have placed candidates in both buoyant and more difficult market conditions. However, in my experience, senior lawyers with 3-6 years of experience have more luck finding jobs than lawyers junior to them. This should not dissuade junior lawyers from applying to jobs, but they may find the process more challenging and/or time consuming.

Format of CV and the Deal Sheet

U.S. law firms like a simple, one-page CV. Here, less is more. I strongly recommend creating a deal sheet that highlights your substantive experience. Not all U.S. law firms are conversant with Canadian schools and universities or their “grading systems.” In some cases, they may also not be familiar with certain Canadian law firms. As a result, it is pivotal that you are able to highlight that you have the right experience for a role.

Visas and Immigration 

American and Canadian attorneys automatically qualify for the TN visa. While this is nothing new, it is worth noting that the visa is granted under the NAFTA agreement. This is material given President Trump’s uncertain position towards NAFTA. This has created some anxiousness over the continued availability of the TN visa; although, it has not deterred firms from hiring Canadian attorneys under TN status.

Due to the uncertainty surrounding U.S. immigration, I have noticed an increasing number of firms hiring Canadian lawyers on the TN visa and subsequently applying for an H1-B visa on their behalf shortly thereafter. Additionally, firms are now more amenable to applying for a green card on behalf of their existing Canadian associates, understanding there might be a risk of losing an attorney to a firm that will be willing to undertake the green card process for them.

Salaries

Good news for all! Salaries in both markets have increased over the past two years. However, there is no denying the increase is more significant in the U.S. market. Just a few weeks ago, Milbank shocked the market by increasing associate salaries. Most of the Am Law 100 firms followed suit. As a result, there is an even greater discrepancy in salaries today than there was in 2016 as between salaries from a Biglaw attorney in the U.S. vs. Canada. In fact, a midlevel associate in New York will make twice as much as midlevel in Canada, when factoring in the exchange rate.

Question: Are Canadian Firms Seeking U.S.-qualified Attorneys? Resounding YES!

The biggest hurdle for U.S. qualified attorneys looking to move north of the border is the daunting NCA process. As I discussed in Part 1, each U.S. attorney must become accredited by the Canadian Federation of Law Societies (also known as the NCA). Following this accreditation, they can sit for the provincial bar exam. This process is tedious and time-consuming, but is definitely doable.

In rare circumstances, firms will consider candidates who have not completed the process. However, these candidates generally have superior credentials.

Understanding the Market

I cannot stress enough the importance of understanding the legal market prior to starting the process. Choosing a firm because a friend can submit your CV is not an approach I recommend. In my opinion, it is more important to find a firm that is professionally and culturally the best fit for you. I am often approached by candidates seeking a change after landing at a firm because they are not the right fit for a role. I strongly recommend working with someone with a deep understanding of the market you are coming from and the market you seek to enter. It will be most valuable in your search. Good luck!

# Are Workdays Getting Shorter Despite Mandatory Office Policies?
## If associates are just coming to offices and spending as little time as possible there while checking the box that they made it to the office in the first place, what is the point of coming to an office at all?

I recently noticed a trend when I was driving around my area in the late afternoon. In years past, the typical rush hour occurred around 5 p.m. — when workdays traditionally ended. Of course, many lawyers and other professionals routinely work past this time, but other people often quit for the day around 5 p.m., causing traffic issues. However, in the past year or so, I’ve been noticing that the rush hour typically starts an hour or more earlier than it previously did. This got me thinking: are people flying the coop from offices earlier than they did in the past?

We all know that attorneys and staff can be just as efficient (or more so) from home than in an office. When someone works from home, they do not need to commute. Moreover, when people work from home, they can complete tasks at their own pace throughout the day rather than cram it into a set period. Working from home also allows people to complete personal tasks easier, which can have a positive impact on morale and efficiency.

However, many law firms are now requiring attorneys to come to an office at least a set number of days a week. Some traditionalists talk about the elusive benefits of in-person work to bolster this requirement, even though people collaborate fine through a variety of virtual means. Moreover, some law firm managers cannot stomach the fact that they signed expensive multiyear leases for offices that would be vacant if people were allowed to work almost exclusively from home.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

However, working in an office is not the same for some workers as it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. Granted, I am self-employed, and I have not worked as an associate attorney at another law firm since 2019. As a result, I do not have firsthand knowledge of what many associates are thinking when they contend with office work policies. However, I have a number of friends who are associates and partners at various law firms, and they tell me that in many instances, office work policies do not necessarily lead to attorneys being in offices for as long as they once were.

Some attorneys now view working from an office a mandated amount of days per week as a box that they need to check off. In order to do so, at many firms, attorneys simply need to show their face at an office a set number of days per week and there are not strict expectations on when they need to be at the office or when they need to leave the office. Accordingly, many of my friends tell me that people are more likely to come to offices later and leave offices earlier in the post-COVID era than before the pandemic. Moreover, attorneys might be more likely to leave an office to fulfill a personal responsibility and then either return to the office or just head home depending on the time of day. Some of my friends tell me that they are more efficient working from home anyway, so they want to just check off an expectation of managers and then return home where they can churn out billable hours in earnest.

This type of behavior just exposes how ridiculous it is if firms require lawyers to be at offices most of the week. I have not heard about expectations concerning when associates need to arrive at and leave an office, and of course, this would be unusual. Law firms can trust associates to use their discretion about when they will arrive at an office and when they will leave, so often there is no requirement about working hours. However, if associates then are just coming to offices and spending as little time as possible in an office while checking the box that they made it to the office in the first place, what is the point of coming to an office at all?

I would love to hear from associates and partners to see if associates are spending less time in an office per day than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic. And if associates are not really spending as much time in offices and are just showing their faces to fulfill expectations of them, it really undermines the alleged reasons for requiring people to work from an office a set number of days each week.

Whoa there, Biglaw! Things are about to get a crazy thanks to [Davis Polk’s move](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/) to raise the new salary scale even higher. Just before that happened, yet another firm squeaked in with a Milbank match, and this time around, it was a firm that you’d actually expect to be one of the first to match the market.

Back in 2018, Winston & Strawn was [one of the first](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/let-the-salary-wars-commence-another-biglaw-firm-has-matched-the-190k-scale/) to match Milbank, and now in 2021, the firm is making the same move. Winston associates will be making money on the new (old) salary scale:

Last time the new salary scale made a quick switch, the firm took about three weeks or so to adopt it, and we expect the same thing will happen here — but maybe a little sooner, if associates are lucky. Congratulations to all at the firm!

# Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries -- Still Lags Behind Competition On Compensation
## Will it be enough cash to keep associates happy?

Well, some money is better than no money. I’m sure that’s the mantra going through the heads of associates at Seyfarth Shaw.

Yesterday, the firm announced on an associate call that all associates are getting raises — to the tune of $20,000. Yay! The raises are retroactive to January 1, will be reflected in February 15th paychecks. But even with that sizable bump, the pay scale at the firm still lags behind the $225K standard set by [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/) at the end of last year. Boo!

It’s probably not too much of a surprise — the firm has consistently fallen behind the top of Biglaw when it comes to compensation. The firm tends to be behind by about one raise cycle — in 2021, they were giving out 2018 salaries, in 2018, they gave out 2016 salaries. In fact, [at the time of the 2021 raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/seyfarth-raises-21/), my colleague Joe Patrice predicted they’d match the 2021 scale in 2024…. And they’re right on schedule (though they’re actually $5K above the 2021 standard for first-years on the firm’s national scale).

While it may not be shocking the firm is behind on pay, tipsters at the firm say it is feeding associate dissatisfaction. The firm has also discussed revamping the bonus formula, but as an insider noted, “no one really expects it to be competitive…or that either will quell dissatisfaction…about half of the associates in my group are looking to lateral elsewhere.”

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Everything is bigger in Texas, including Biglaw’s presence. Which large law firm is the latest to lasso up lawyers in the Lone Star State?

After opening its first Texas office two years ago in Dallas, Nelson Mullins — a firm that took in $727,916,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 68 in the Am Law 100 — announced earlier this week that it has opened a second Texas outpost, this one in Houston, and that it’s being staffed by partners poached from other Biglaw firms. To that end, the Nelson Mullins Houston office will be led by Craig Dillard, who currently serves as co-head of Foley & Lardner’s oil and gas practice in addition to the firm’s local litigation practice group.

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/nelson-mullins-law-firm-opens-office-houston-2024-04-01/) has details on what Nelson Mullins hopes to achieve in Texas:

The firm, in announcing its Houston office, said it is looking to expand its work in the energy, private equity and healthcare sectors. Firm managing partner Jim Lehman said Nelson Mullins has “significant clients” in Houston, but he declined to identify them. …

Lehman said he expects Nelson Mullins to have 100 lawyers in Texas within the next three to four years. The firm’s Dallas office has grown from nine lawyers in one location to 32 lawyers in two Dallas-based offices, a spokesperson said.

Congratulations to Nelson Mullins on its latest home on the range!

# A Complete Guide To Legal Transaction Management

Legal transactions are complicated. 

A simple sale of one company to another can require hundreds of documents, working together in an intricate web to effect a legally binding transfer of ownership. 

Unfortunately, these webs of documents are only getting larger and more intricate. And these challenges are compounded by ever-decreasing timelines for deals to get done. 

This is where LTM comes in. 

Legal transaction management software provides a structured workflow that lets transactional lawyers automate away mundane, error-prone tasks they currently do manually. 

Contrary to the recent hype cycle surrounding AI technologies that have failed to deliver sustainable value, LTM software represents a return to the basics of using software to augment human efforts. 

Our friends at iManage have watched the space evolve over the last decade. They have channeled all of this experience into preparing this guide.

Download their white paper today and in just a few short pages, you, too, will understand what LTM is, along with how it can simplify transaction management and the closing process.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# Being A Good Law Firm Associate Can Be A Bad Thing
## For instance, being good as a law firm associate might mean that an attorney has more work than other associates with little upside.

Most people assume that if they are good at their jobs as law firm associates, they will reap a number of vocational and financial rewards. Indeed, the work product and drive of law firm associates is usually used to evaluate attorneys for partnership, bonuses, and other employment incentives. However, due to the dysfunctional nature of some law firms, being good as a law firm associate can actually be bad for an attorney.

For instance, being good as a law firm associate might mean that an attorney has more work than other associates with little upside. Of course, for law firms that give bonuses according to billable hours recorded, this might be a good thing since the attorney will have more opportunities to bill time and increase their bonus. However, for many law firms that provide a similar level of compensation to individuals with similar backgrounds, being good at your job can mean that you have more work than peers without any increase in pay.

I once worked at a law firm that paid everyone similar compensation depending on their background. We were all assigned a certain amount of cases to manage. When I started, I was responsible for 25 or so cases. By the time I left the shop, I was responsible for around 40 cases. Of course, it makes sense that managers will provide more work to individuals once they get more experienced and can handle an increased workload.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

However, there was one lawyer at our firm that was extremely good at being a “street lawyer” and many of us even called him “The Godfather” because we respected his experience and competence. This attorney had far more cases than any of us. I believe it could have been as high as 60. This was not necessarily a good thing for this associate. The attorney was far busier than other attorneys, and he had more stress since he needed to juggle all of his files and make sure that he was on top of his cases. This attorney made less money than a number of associates since he came to the firm before the job market got more competitive and many of us received pay raises. I felt bad for this attorney, and in solidarity with him (and to get more experience) I once took an appeal off his plate so that he had less work to manage. Because our firm did not provide compensation to attorneys who completed more work, being good at his job actually hurt my friend.

Another way that being good at your job as a law firm associate can hurt is because of interoffice politics. Sometimes, more-senior lawyers might feel threatened by junior associates who excel at their jobs because they may see them as competitors for partnership or counsel positions. As a result, they may freeze out such associates from certain projects at a firm and leave them out of efforts to develop business.

I once had a friend who was an amazing associate when we worked together at a shop. He ended up leaving the firm we both worked at and started working at another shop. Within a few years at the other firm, my friend got laid off, which was extremely confounding to me since I knew this attorney was extremely competent.

Take this with a grain of salt, but my friend told me that because of interoffice politics, and maybe because more-senior attorneys felt threatened by my friend, this person was locked out of working on certain projects. Without the ability to bill too many hours, my friend was a target for being laid off. In my own experience, I have witnessed lawyers gripe about interoffice politics, and even leave law firms because they were seemingly good at their jobs and people felt threatened that they might be competitors for promotions and other incentives.

Law firms can take some steps to ensure that associates do not have any barriers for providing top-quality work. Perhaps most importantly, law firms both big and small should provide bonuses based on the number of hours an associate bills. This seems like a no-brainer since law firms seemingly make more money from high-billing attorneys, but few law firms provide bonuses based on billable hours even though this provides an incentive for quality work. In addition, law firms should eliminate the power that midlevel attorneys have over junior attorneys to prevent situations in which attorneys who feel they are competing for promotions foil the efforts of other attorneys. A law firm’s first priority should be providing top-rate legal services to clients, and they should not let inefficiencies and office politics get in the way of performing legal work.

Of course, being a good law firm associate more often than not means that any attorney might be benefited financially and vocationally. However, law firms should take steps to eliminate those situations in which being good as an associate can actually hurt an attorney.

# How Safe Is Your Reputation?

In a [recent Above the Law survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/what-keeps-attorneys-up-at-night/), our audience identified “reputational risk” as their greatest professional fear. 

Which got us asking: How prepared are lawyers to face the pitfalls that abound in today’s world — as varied as online reviews, data breaches, malpractice suits, [and Twitter](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/lawyers-love-to-hate-twitter/)? 

Please take this anonymous survey to help us gauge how lawyers are maintaining their good name in this sometimes-chaotic environment.

And as a thank you, we’ll be awarding a $250 gift card to one winner.

I am lucky to have two children; they’re six and nearly four and they make me so happy, although I’ve had to adjust to mess (see [my last post on OCD](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/women-and-the-panopticon-of-the-law-part-2-a-letter-to-my-pre-lawyer-self/)), noise, and feeling like a constant underachiever on the mom front.

I am the classic depiction of Mila Kunis’s character in Bad Moms, with my bakery bought yum-yums in a plastic box at the school home bake sale, dashing into parents’ evening late and sitting at the back, and sending emails to work whilst I am supposed to be listening to this term’s curriculum.

I’ve fallen out of favor with the other parents at my daughter’s school this term because it’s my duty to make sure my daughter emerges from her school cultured and appreciative of the arts, and so I asked in open forum when the children would learn a musical instrument. The following week, the whole class came home with ocarinas. This was wonderfully educational because: (1) I didn’t have the faintest clue what an ocarina is; and (2) I learned that it makes a sound that makes my ears want to bleed.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I don’t hold any answers on how to manage a family alongside a cripplingly demanding career, but I do have some insights on what I see working and not working in the context of juggling the two, and I have seen it done successfully by single parents, parents where both partners work, and parents where one works and the other does not.

The challenges mostly boil down to this:

1) Expectations on your workplace, your partner, and/or your care network;
2) The expense and reliability of your childcare; and
3) Finding time to spend with your children.

George Banks in Mary Poppins wasn’t far wrong when he said “a British Nanny must be a General,” and since Mary Poppins hasn’t floated in on the East winds to take care of my children, I have had to put some rigid boundaries in place to deal with the issues above.

1) Setting expectations:

The main source of stress for women in the workplace quite often appears to come from the mismatch of expectations society has on fathers. I see so many mothers having to ask their workplace for all of the necessary concessions to care for children. I see so many mothers having to run home for sick children, pack the school bags, attend the school events, and help their children with homework. Working mothers should not face these pressures alone, which may mean engaging more involvement from the other parent or activating the care network to a greater degree to deal with these things.

I see some grandparent and family and friend networks successfully helping working parents deal with these issues, but we do live in ways that increasingly isolate us from those networks. Gone are the days when hordes of close relatives would arrive as soon as you give birth to rotate the cooking, cleaning, bathing, and cuddling duties. Most mothers now have to do it all largely alone and it’s unrealistic, so if you can’t pay for the help and you don’t have a support network, you have to look closer to home to share these responsibilities more equally with your partner. If that means you cook in bulk one Sunday for the week ahead and he does it the next, so you can spend your second Sunday relaxing, so be it. All should be fair in love and housework.

If one person shoulders all of the burden and makes all of the concessions, it’s feasible that their partner’s career will fly (because they essentially have no commitments) and the conceding partner’s career will flail, because they repeatedly look like a muddled mess fretting over family organizational matters as well as workplace pressures.

I am blessed to have worked in two law firms where the teams place value on family life and agile working has been the norm for men and women. The work being done to a high standard and on deadline is placed above whether my jacket has been on the back of the chair and management in both firms have sent bold messages to the naysayers that the tides have changed and that they are to respect and accommodate different working practices. My experience is that it creates a productive workforce. Certainly, the agile working parents at my last firm were top billers in the team, and studies indicate that increased autonomy in the workplace can be more motivating than money.

2) Childcare obstacles

For international readers, you should stand shocked at how much we pay in the UK for childcare and how inflexible the business of childcare can be here. The OECD has published a report on the matter indicating that the UK has the highest net income percentage spend on childcare costs of the 35 industrialized countries analyzed. According to this study, we spend 34% of our family net income on full-time childcare compared to 26% in the US, 17% in the Netherlands, and 10% in Germany and France. Coupled with that hefty financial shackle, good nurseries are in short supply and don’t always open and close at hours that suit the needs of their clientele. Until the UK government fully recognizes the barriers that childcare costs have on our economy, the ability for both parents of young children to work will remain severely hampered. Without proper state-subsidized solutions, many families cannot afford to have both parents work because it costs more to pay for childcare than the second working parent would earn. Simple economics rule behavior. I know hundreds of stay-at-home parents who would love to work part-time or full-time, but wouldn’t dream of doing so until they earn more than their childcare costs them. In turn, the economy suffers because the longer someone remains out of work, the harder it is to return. Therefore, more often than not, mothers are forced to give up work and they get into a skills depreciation cycle, they lose confidence, and the result is that we have less working women in our society and, consequently, less chance of women emerging as leaders in their fields.

I always encourage women with children who I mentor to stay in the workplace somehow, anyhow. This can be achieved by doing contract work (which is now very popular in the legal profession), by doing part-time or agile working, or by doing pro-bono/charity work. I would also urge women on parental leave to stay in contact at work on their leave periods (which tend to be longer in the UK than the US), as you want to keep yourself at the forefront of your colleagues’ minds.

3) Precious time

Finally, it’s crucial to find ways to spend quality time with your children when you are a working parent and in our busy lives, boundaries need to be set in stone about what you expect of yourself and what others expect of you. You have to be militant about your time. One way to achieve this is to list out your ultimate long- and short-term goals and then, every time someone puts a meeting in your diary that might result in you missing something that’s important to your children, ask yourself if that meeting is aligned to your goals list. If it’s not, ditch it and get home on time. At weekends and during holidays, carve out chunks of time where you don’t look at work emails or social media or text messages, so you can commit wholehearted attention to your children and, most importantly, shed all guilt associated with these empowering behaviors.

# Legal Tech In 2018: Could This Be The Year That Biglaw Strikes Back?

2018 will be the year I return to law firms

It’s been a long time coming. In 2013, I left my law firm to launch a [startup](http://www.replyall.me) and then (quite by accident) started writing about the new wave of legal tech startups in 2014. At that point, legal tech and innovation were not nearly as sexy as they are today. I used to see a major dip in traffic if I wrote about legal tech, but that is no longer the case. Since 2014, I’ve tried to cover not just the emerging startups, but the more established companies as well. I didn’t limit myself to tech and made sure to highlight alternative legal service providers (or LPOs or law companies or whatever they’re calling themselves) as well as innovative in-house departments.

But you know who I did NOT write about? Law firms.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In my naïveté, and having been a frustrated Biglaw associate myself, I saw the law firms as the exact opposite of innovation — in my mind they were the slow moving Mesozoic target of disruption. AI, machine learning, and robots were going to do to law firms what Netflix did to Blockbuster or what Amazon did to Borders (remember Borders?). Even as I deep-dived into the legal industry, my impression of “law firm innovation” was that it was mostly [bullshit](http://www.geeklawblog.com/2017/09/on-law-firm-marketing-bullshit.html), a desperate attempt at PR, or both. Law firms wanted to be seen as innovative, but they didn’t actually want to be innovative.

We are now reaching a tipping point and I expect more firms to embrace real, sustainable innovation. I don’t have any cute data points, I’m basing this only my own experience and direct conversations. There are certainly firms (my bet is that it’s still the majority) that are simply waiting and doing nothing — and this may very well work out for them. Sure, technologies like [Luminance](http://Luminance.com) and [Heretik](http://heretik.com) allows large numbers of documents to be reviewed much more efficiently, and a platform like [Doxly](http://doxly.com) transforms the process of managing any corporate transaction. But, if your clients aren’t asking for it, why make the purchase — especially when these platforms will prima facie reduce your billable hours?

But adopting technology is just the beginning, and purchasing technology alone does not an innovative law firm make. The innovative firms I’m talking about have recognized that they can be leaders in legal technology and next generation legal services. Consider the startups I mentioned above as an example: [Slaughter & May](http://Slaughterandmay.com) reportedly [has an equity stake in Luminance](https://www.legaltechnology.com/latest-news/slaughter-and-may-5-stake-in-luminance/), Heretik has an investment from a firm in the Am Law 100 (you heard it here first), and Doxly has an investment from [Dentons’ Nextlaw Labs.](http://www.nextlawlabs.com/) Not to be outdone, Allen & Overy and Mishcon de Reya are running legal tech accelerators and Orrick recently hired Jackson Ratcliffe, who had been consulting, to be the technical lead for [Orrick Labs](https://biglawbusiness.com/law-firm-creates-internal-skunkworks-to-develop-tech/). [Holland & Knight](http://hklaw.com) has a robust innovation committee made up of a cross section of the lawyers who are tasked not only with identifying cutting edge tech that they bring to the firm’s attention, but also with coming up with a sustainable implementation strategy.

And this is all just tip of the iceberg stuff.

That’s why in 2018, I’m going back to the law firm. Law firms have significant resources, an unparalleled development environment, and direct access to clients — how many tech companies can say that? The reason that I’m betting law firms are going to embrace innovation is that there is a clear market opportunity for those that do, and I believe in efficient markets. That’s why, even though I’m still suffering from Legalweek sleep exhaustion, I will be heading all the way back from Tel Aviv to Scottsdale for the [ALT Conference](http://altnets.org/ctrl-alt-del-networking-rebooted/) (ALT is short for Association of Legal Technologists) starting this Sunday. If Legalweek is the big event of the year where tech companies get to woo law firms with their new shiny stuff, the ALT Conference is an intimate gathering of law firm decision makers who want to use design thinking to implement innovation inside a law firm. I’m betting that some of the next big ideas in legal are going to originate inside law firms and at gatherings like the ALT Conference, and I don’t want to miss out.

I’m going to be writing about this a lot in 2018, so, if your firm is working on something innovative, I’d love to hear more on or off the record — email me or [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-abramowitz-18504423). Going to be at ALT? Email me and let’s set up a time to meet. Want to follow my conversations with innovative legal influencers? Drop your email in below.

# 3 Good Things About 2022
## Take a small slice of the downtime that the holiday season presents to think about the three things in the past year that you are grateful for.

As we enter Week 2 of the 2022 holiday season, I think we all deserve to end the year on a good note. As with all years, 2022 was not without its challenges, both professionally and personally, a fact that I am sure is true for at least most of this distinguished readership. For myself, the lowest point of the year came as I lay sprawled out on the street on a chilly fall morning, after being hit by a hit-and-run driver around the block from my house. (If you are in Brooklyn and see a silver Lexus with a black roof and tinted windows, give it a wide berth – and snap a picture of the license plate if you can.) Yes, things could have been much worse for me, but I was able to bounce back up, albeit with some badly cut-up knees and ribs that felt like Mike Tyson had mistaken me for his heavy bag. Despite that dark moment, I can’t feel anything other than optimism for 2023. Including on the work front, where the projects begun in 2022 are looking promising in terms of bearing fruit in 2023 and beyond.

In my book, gratitude is one of the most elevated of human expressions, so I am proud to go through three features of my life in 2022 that I am grateful for. And I encourage everyone to take at least a small slice of the well-earned downtime that the holiday season presents to think about the three things in the past year that you are grateful for as well. Last impressions are lasting impressions — and it is always helpful to end a year with a spirit of optimism for the year ahead. Not because we can or should expect that the coming year will be free of all challenges, but because the one thing we can control is how we react to the challenges and successes that are sure to arise. Doing so with a grateful spirit will surely stand us all in good stead. So make your list of three and I hope the below will help inspire that effort on your behalf. As you will see, I chose to focus on small things that enrich my life, even as I am of course grateful for the larger things that serve as my bedrock on a daily basis.

First, I discovered my newest passion this past year — and it all started with seeing an interesting patent case filed that I [covered ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/row-row-row-your-fake-boat/)on these pages. After that column ran, some helpful readers made recommendations for a new rowing machine for my home gym, which ultimately led to my purchase of a NordicTrack rower. No, it was not a Concept2, but I felt like having the video lessons would be helpful. Since then, my day feels incomplete if I am not on my erg at least once a day for a spirited 20-40 minute session, depending on whether I am targeting a HIIT or steady state row. More importantly, my time on the machine inspired me to learn how to scull on the water, leading to my joining a local rowing club. Three to four outdoor sessions a week in the summer were pure bliss, especially after I got to the point where capsizing my boat was not too much of a worry. Strong bodies help build strong minds, and I hope that everyone reading this can find — or continue — a fitness regimen that they love in 2023.

Second, 2022 was a year filled with good podcasts, which helped me pass the time on the rowing machine and on the water. In the car, as well — and often when I am just walking around or doing errands. Lots of podcasts, I guess. From old standbys like the Tony Kornheiser or Bill Simmons podcasts, to new favorites like “Plain English” with the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson, there is always an interesting discussion to listen in on. In addition to the regular rotation, I also found myself using podcasts to do a deep dive into interesting personalities I have read about or heard over the course of the year. To that end, I must have listened to at least a dozen interviews with negotiation maestro Chris Voss over the course of the year. And even though he definitely replays some of the hits for each interviewer, I still found the exercise time well spent, with something new to  take away from each discussion. In short, podcasts were a big part of my year, and I am grateful for the talented people that brought them to life.

Lastly, I remain very grateful for the opportunity to write this column and engage with this audience. For one, having a weekly opportunity to write allows me to keep track of areas of IP that I simply don’t encounter much in my day-to-day practice. At the same time, this column also gives me the opportunity to dig a little deeper into interesting IP developments because I can follow stories or cases over time to see how they unfold. Most importantly, having the chance to interview amazing IP personalities is always a thrill, while also being one of the most enriching aspects of getting to write for ATL. So to all my 2022 interviewees, thanks again for taking the time to share your insights with this audience. And to everyone at ATL and this readership, here is hoping that 2023 is filled with good health, good cheer, and the opportunity for each of us to do good in the world.

Good news from Squire Patton Boggs!

Despite[ $1,035,000,000 in gross revenue](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#) last year, the firm instituted COVID-19 austerity measures. [Back in May, Squire Patton Boggs announced a ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/despite-a-billion-dollars-in-gross-revenue-squire-patton-boggs-cuts-salaries-amid-covid-19-austerity-measures/?rf=1)20 percent salary cut for all associates, as well as staff cuts, between 10 and 20 percent, depending on salary, and partner distributions were adjusted to shoulder the largest financial burden. But [beginning in October](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/billion-dollar-biglaw-firm-reverses-pay-cuts-for-associates/), the salary cuts ended, an excellent sign that the worst impacts of the pandemic were over.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Now there’s even more good news. The firm has announced that they’re making true-up payments for all associates, giving them back the salary they missed out on from May through September. In the firm’s U.S. offices, associates will see the payment in the next December payroll (U.K. offices will look at their performance at the end of April, which is the end of its fiscal year).

Chairman/Global CEO Mark Ruehlmann had this to say about the payments:

“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our associates have performed admirably under challenging circumstances to provide excellent services to our clients. Thanks to their hard work and shared sacrifices, the impacts of the global pandemic on our business have been less significant than we anticipated with demand remaining strong.”

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

First came [Linklaters](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/the-first-magic-circle-firm-pulls-money-out-of-its-hat/), then came [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-fat-chance-this-match-wasnt-going-to-happen/), and yesterday, Freshfields finally announced its Cravath match for all of its U.S. associates in New York, NY, and Washington, D.C. In case you’ve forgotten what this year’s bonus scale looks like, here’s how Freshfields is making its match:

Class of 2017 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $15,000
Class of 2015 — $25,000
Class of 2014 — $50,000
Class of 2013 — $65,000
Class of 2012 — $80,000
Class of 2011 — $90,000
Class of 2010 — $100,000
Class of 2009 and more senior — $100,000

Freshfields will pay its bonuses on December 30, 2017, which will make for a very happy New Year for its U.S. associates. The firm’s bonus memo is on the next page.

We’ve heard from almost all members of the Magic Circle except for one — Allen & Overy. What’s going on at A&O? If you have any intel, please reach out to us.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us at 646-820-8477. We look forward to hearing from you.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Biglaw Firm Whose Latest Partnership Did No Favors For Diversity Pledges To 'Do Better' Next Time
## The firm's chairman hopes this PR nightmare won't 'erase the firm’s diversity achievements over the past 75 years.'

We certainly can—and will—do better. I regret the gender and racial imbalance in our newly elected partnership class (one woman, one Latino, one LGBTQ partner, only 25 percent diverse), which resulted from an idiosyncratic demographic pool and which I can assure you will not be repeated.

We intend to continue to play a leadership role in diversity in terms of race, gender and sexual orientation. We look forward to being judged not by our words, but by our results, in the years to come,” Karp said. “There is no more important issue to me (and the firm’s leadership) than diversity and it is critical to me that Paul Weiss maintain its historic leadership role as a firm that champions diversity in terms of race, gender and sexual orientation.

Our percentage of female, African-American and LGBTQ partners and associates greatly exceeds the average for New York and U.S. law firms. It would be unfortunate and disappointing if an idiosyncratic demographic pool in one particular year would erase the firm’s diversity achievements over the past 75 years.

— Paul Weiss chairman [Brad Karp](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/brad-s-karp), in a [statement](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/12/18/paul-weiss-vows-to-do-better-after-partner-promotions-stir-diversity-debate/) given regarding the seeming [lack of diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/paul-weiss-press-release-captures-everything-broken-about-biglaw-in-one-image/) in the firm’s latest partnership class. It’s worth mentioning that Paul Weiss has a history with putting diversity first: in the 1940s, it was the first major New York firm to hire an African-American male associate and female associate, and during the same time frame, it was the first major New York firm to welcome a woman to its partnership ranks.

# Another Biglaw Firm Is Expanding Gender Neutral Parental Leave For All Employees
## Good news!

Here at Above the Law, we make it a habit to cover whenever a Biglaw firm expands its[ parental leave](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/parental-leave/). The move is a growing trend to be sure, and the expanded programs are regularly offered now as gender neutral and without a primary caregiver stipulation. This is good news we should — and are! — celebrating. But we also hope to build the pressure and shame on the firms whose policies and entrenched in the past.

Anyway, on to the good news!

Yesterday, Kramer Levin announced some big changes to their parental leave policy. The firm’s policy — which it should be noted applies to all employees, not just lawyers — will allow new parents, regardless of parenting role, to take 12 weeks’ paid leave. This is on top of any disability leave. And the policy applies to births, adoptions and foster care placements of a child.

Kudos to the firm!

With more and more firms stepping up, expanded, gender neutral leave may start to feel de rigueur, and that’s a good thing by itself. But we should also remember it’s an important step, one [experts say will help ameliorate the gender pay gap. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/everything-you-need-to-know-about-biglaw-parental-leave/)And that’s good news we can all get behind.

Check out the firm’s complete policy below.

I have been a working woman for 25 years. I’ve been a lawyer, an insurance professional, and a trial consultant. I’ve given keynotes to groups of thousands, written books, blogs, and articles. I’ve founded a business, and educational company, and engaged in intense academic study. None of this compares to the work I put in during the 12 weeks of maternity leave. I would probably start crying if I had to write about it, so I set it music, so I can laugh about it.

The 12 Weeks of Maternity Leave

On the first week of maternity leave my babies gave to me,
No more needles I’m IVF-free!

On the second week of maternity leave my babies gave to me,
A scar from my emergency C!

On the third week of maternity leave my babies gave to me,
A respite from gestational diabeteees!

On the tenth week of maternity leave my babies gave to me,
Pediatrician appointments each month about three!

The colic, as well as the post-partum anxiety, which followed from years of being an infertility patient, birthed feelings of being completely overwhelmed. As a trial consultant, I straddle the world of two disciplines, law and psychology, which teach us to view facts and statistics in a detached logical fashion. Logical is exactly how I approached my maternity leave. Logical. Simple. Factual. Have a baby (or two). Take allotted time off to care for baby (or two). Put on a suit, some shoes, and get back to work. My logical mind did not take into account all of the intangibles, and the creativity and grit it would take to accomplish life’s most basic tasks.

Well, a funny thing happened on the way to the office. My logical brain was never the same, and in exchange, with my gift of two babies, I was gifted the chance to put my creative side to work. I now look back on that time with the hindsight of someone who not just survived the experience, but went on to pursue degrees in psychology that I have put to use as a successful litigation consultant. It’s now my job to help my clients identify the biases at work in the law — such as caregiver bias or bias against mothers — and know now to respond. I now draw on my personal experiences, my training, and that gift of creativity. Yes, as a trial consultant, I train my clients to view facts and statistics logically. As a woman and mother, I also train my clients to use that logic in creative ways to their advantage.
