# Did You Major In Logistics?
## Biglaw is adjusting to a new normal, but it’s not just Biglaw, it’s every firm of every shape and size.

[Logistics](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/logistics). It is “the detailed coordination of a complex operation involving many people, facilities or supplies.” There are people who have advanced degrees in logistics, but I wonder how many lawyers, how many judges, how many court administrators have such degrees. We’ve all experienced occasional courthouse closings due to various disrupting events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and other happenings out of the ordinary. But the closings have usually been short, nothing like what we are experiencing now. Most courts, at least state courts here in California, have been closed for a month or more.

At some point, the courts will reopen and then what? What a backlog will greet them.

Once courts reopen, who will be allowed in the courthouse, let alone the courtrooms? Will there be testing before entry into the courthouse? Will there be testing once in the courthouse along with the present security measures? Hopefully, there won’t be any tantrums like the attorney who [pulled off his pants](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer-who-took-off-pants-at-checkpoint-fights-bid-to-oust-him-from-representing-clients) because he was asked to remove his belt at the security checkpoint (and that was several months ago). Will there be temperature checks? Who will do them?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Right now, testing kits are not readily available, as they should be and will need to be. Right now, test results are not readily available on a moment’s notice. Will people have to wait for results before they can enter? How long will that test result be good for? We are told that you can test negative and then subsequently test positive. Will people need to be tested before even going to the courthouse? Will they need a doctor’s note or some similar verification? Unless you have had the virus or are immune, we all know that there are lots of people who are asymptomatic. What do you do about those people going to court?

Let’s assume that you have made it past the security checkpoint (leaving aside the testing issue). We know now (or we should know, and if we do not, shame on us) that most, if not all, routine court appearances can be handled by videoconferencing of one sort or another. Hooray for the reduction in the client’s expense, but maybe not so hooray for the attorney who used to be able to bill for travel time and the time spent cooling heels in the courtroom. So, unless judges refuse to get with the “new normal,” this may be one possible positive result of COVID-19 for the client.

Change the scenario. There are jury trials to be had, and criminal trials take priority. I would imagine that there will be lots of criminal defendants who will raise speedy trial issues and that because the trial did not take place within the statutorily mandated time, the case should be dismissed. I am not a constitutional law maven, but I would hazard a guess that the state’s actions could pass the “strict scrutiny” test. There still will be trials, but, as before, most criminal cases will result in pleas.

But what if the parties ask, “Ready for trial?’ How will that happen given the social distancing and other provisos that will still be in place? Will there be a jury assembly room? If so, social distancing could be well-nigh impossible in that situation. We have an “on-call” juror system here, so jurors are only called if there is a need for a panel.

But you still must “assemble.” Will that “assembly” be remote? What happens when your juror ID number is called, and you need to report to a courtroom? Logistically, how will that work? Normally (I must stop using that word) you would go to the courthouse, go through security, and proceed to the courtroom. Will that still be the process if you “assemble” remotely?

What about courtroom staff? How will they be protected? The clerk, the bailiff, the court reporter, and of course, the judge. Is there six feet of separation among them now? What about counsel? Is there six feet of clearance at counsel table so that counsel can fit? I would guess that there is going to be some choreographing of how this will all work, at least there should be.

How will the courtroom be reconfigured to allow jurors? My guess is that the entire courtroom will be used for juror spacing, and that the spectator area will be a thing of the past, at least for the foreseeable future. (Goodbye open courtrooms.) What do you do about the jury room? What if the jury must be excused while the lawyers and the court discuss certain issues? Are they out in the hallway six feet apart? What if there is more than one jury out in the hallway at the same time? How will that work?

Finally, yes, because my head is about to explode, how will jury deliberations be handled? Jury rooms are notably close quarters (only dinosaurs will remember [the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_13J_9B5jEk) 12 Angry Men. If you have never seen it, you have time to see it now). Will jurors be permitted to deliberate in the same way as they have in the past? It is the give and take in the jury room that is so essential to deliberations and reaching a verdict.

Biglaw is adjusting to a new normal, and ATL is covering the changes extensively, but it’s not just Biglaw, it’s every firm of every shape and size. It’s also law schools and law students, whether graduating and ready to take the bar, whenever that is, or just starting.

The judiciary will need to adjust as well. How the public will access the justice system once courts reopen? There are tough logistical times ahead. We can whine all we want, not that it will do much, if any, good. Now is the time for us to pull up our big kid pants and help access to justice however we can, and that will mean developing the patience that we are not known for.

We discuss the crackerjack investigation the Supreme Court performed into allegations that Justice Sam Alito has a history of leaking decisions. After a religious leader confessed to lobbying efforts that included leaks from Alito concerning key decisions, Alito told the Court “it wasn’t me” and, remarkably, they just accepted that and called it a day. Speaking of decisions, the Eleventh Circuit finally put a stop to Judge Aileen Cannon’s string of zany decisions in the Trump seized documents case. Also, a former Biglaw partner thrust herself in the spotlight to bemoan her firm for enforcing the bare minimum of anti-harassment policies and a pair of law schools controversially announces a merger.

# These Are The Biglaw Firms Racking Up The Lateral Partners
## Are you surprised by the firms on the list?

The Biglaw[ lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/) continues to be fire. And, as Above the Law has documented, that’s resulted in all manner of repercussions, like [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/), [signing bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/), [retention bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-skadden-arps-handing-out-retention-bonuses-to-only-some-associates/), [raises](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2021-associate-salary-increase/), [offers without interviews](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-job-offers-without-interviews-what-hath-the-hot-lateral-market-wrought/), and making[ senior associates lateral partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/one-way-to-get-senior-associates-to-lateral-biglaw-firms-offer-them-partnership/).

But while a lot of these trends are focused around associates that are potentially looking to leave their firm, the partner market has also seen a [spike in activity](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/by-the-numbers-20-legal-hires-that-shaped-big-law-in-2021). Remember the[ blockbuster move](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/paul-hastings-big-winner-in-blockbuster-lateral-move/) of 43 attorneys (including 18 partners) from Stroock & Stroock & Lavan to Paul Hastings? As historical as that move was, Paul Hastings is far from the only firm looking to bolster their partnership ranks.

[Leopard Solutions](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/) has broken down exactly which Biglaw firms have added the most lateral partners. Over the last 12 months (April 12, 2021 – April 14, 2022), the five Biglaw firms busy hiring the most lateral partners are: Kirkland & Ellis with 114 lateral partners, Louis Brisbois with 98 lateral partners, Greenberg Traurig with 68 partners, Nelson Mullins with 66, and Goodwin at 58. Leopard’s [lateral data](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/index.php/firmscape/) is updated twice a week, so you can keep up as the lateral market evolves.

It’s [no real surprise](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/the-20-million-biglaw-partner-aka-the-kirkland-effect/) Kirkland is topping the list, the largest firm with the most revenue has plenty of cash to throw at new (to them) partners. But taking a look at the top five is interesting and gives a good sense of which firms are playing to win in the lateral merry-go-round.

# Biglaw Summer Programs Continue To Shrink, With 43 Percent Of Firms Making Fewer Offers
## Should law students start freaking out about their future employment prospects?

You’re probably going to need a magnifying glass to see this tiny summer class.

Biglaw recruitment at law schools for entry-level positions remained steady last year, but summer associate class sizes shrunk and fewer offers were handed out, indicating that law firm growth efforts may have finally petered out in the wake of the recession’s toll on attorney headcount at firms across the country.

According to the National Association for Law Placement (NALP), Biglaw recruiting levels are now on par with what they were prior to 2009 when the economy gave way and the legal profession lost its footing. “Recruiting numbers were mostly flat compared to last year,” said NALP executive director James Leipold, “and in some cases we saw some pulling back, particularly at the largest firms, suggesting that the most recent period of growth has ended.”

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/02/21/law-firm-recruitment-activity-steady-but-summer-programs-shrink/) has some additional details on NALP’s latest survey:

[T]he survey found that for the second year in a row the aggregate summer offer volume decreased compared to the year prior. Forty-three percent of law firms that responded to NALP’s surveys said that they had made fewer offers for the 2018 summer programs than they did for 2017 summer programs. As a whole, offices in New York City made fewer offers for summer programs while Silicon Valley remained flat.

In addition, the survey found that the average summer program class size at the nation’s largest law firms also dipped in 2017. For firms with more than 700 lawyers, the average summer class fell to 20 in 2017 from 22 in 2016.

Just last month, Leipold [referred](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/the-incredible-shrinking-summer-associate-class/) to Biglaw’s shrinking summer class sizes as a “meaningful dip in recruiting.” Should law students start freaking out about their future employment prospects? Not quite yet.

It may be a little harder to get a Biglaw job right now, but Leipold says that “[a]bsent a dramatic economic interruption of some sort, the picture for law firm recruiting is not likely to change dramatically in the short term.” In case you’ve forgotten, Biglaw salary increases are pretty great predictors of [economic downturns](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/), so cross your fingers that we aren’t headed for another recession before you get a job.

# Does The Coronavirus Spell Doom For Biglaw?
## The world is not ending, and Biglaw will subsist, and as the early Am Law 200 reports indicate, thrive.

The rise of the novel coronavirus has the world on edge as it struggles to mitigate what might be a devastating global pandemic, or a more severe seasonal flu. 

Nonetheless, we can have preparedness without panic. Firms are already adopting measures to combat the spread of the virus. Dentons, which famously swallowed up the 4,000 strong Chinese firm Dacheng in 2015, has temporarily closed its Wuhan office and many Biglaw firms are directing their attorneys in China to work remotely. Orrick, Norton Rose, Duane Morris, and Baker Botts are either canceling or imposing restrictions on their upcoming conferences and retreats in the U.S. and abroad. 

In Shanghai, Quinn Emanuel and Squire Patton Boggs are reimbursing attorneys for taxi expenses should they have to travel to their offices to dissuade them from taking public transportation. In Milan, Biglaw firms Baker McKenzie and Squire Patton Boggs are encouraging their attorneys to work from home as the virus spreads in Italy, and Baker McKenzie has closed their London office after one employee returned from Italy sick.  

[Justin Flowers](https://www.laterallink.com/team/justin-flowers), our Principal in Hong Kong, has been monitoring the situation closely since the outbreak. He notes that the initial panic has mostly subsided, and despite market turmoil, there is a feeling that the gears are shifting and a return to normalcy has begun. On Monday, many firms in Hong Kong and Shanghai are expected to begin implementing return-to-work policies and Beijing will likely follow suit. 

Across the globe, other countries are enacting isolation measures. Japan announced schools will close for at least a month to reduce transmission of the virus. Schools in China have already closed, affecting 200 million children. The U.S. is taking a more reactionary approach, waiting for cases to appear before closing down communal spaces. 

Forecasting how the virus might impact Biglaw relies on a myriad of assumptions. Currently, the Dow Jones is plummeting in response to the virus’s corporate shrapnel. Thursday saw the largest point drop in the index’s history. The ripple effect could be wide-reaching – China’s carbon footprint [has dropped 25 percent compared](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/climate/nyt-climate-newsletter-coronavirus.html) to the same period last year, reflecting the slowdown in factory production in China. 

Supply chain disruptions have already had a tangible effect on companies with major footprints in China like Apple, whose stock is down 16.4 percent from its record high in mid-February, and has reported slowdowns in their Chinese factories. Unlike many of its peers, Apple’s reported cash reserves of $250 billion dwarfs even Smaug’s river of gold in the Lonely Mountain, a prescient policy harkening back to Apple’s near bankruptcy in the late 1990s. For the rest, the hope is that the rhetoric surrounding the coronavirus will be mostly sound and fury, similar to the H1N1 outbreak of 2009 that stirred up visions of global doom. 

Forecasting what the disease progression might look like has been difficult. As of right now, there are 51 countries with confirmed cases of the virus. There have been many attempts to quantify how contagious and how deadly the virus is. On Monday, an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) gave an update on the severity of the disease. Using data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, they found that the overall case fatality ratio (CFR) – deaths per cases confirmed by RT-PCR or other assays – [was 2.3 percent ](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130). Compared to the CRR of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (9.6 percent) and SARS (34.4 percent), the disease is assumed at this point to be much less deadly. What distinguishes the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is how rapidly and widely it is spreading. Even though the disease is presumably much less deadly than both MERS or SARS, it has already led to more total deaths because it is spreading much quicker. 

There have been many attempts to quantify the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, but the limited datasets and differences in statistical modelings have created a wide range of proposed outcomes. Epidemiologists use a measure called R0 (R naught) to estimate the spread of a disease. R0, also known as the basic reproduction number, tries to measure how many new cases one case of the virus will cause. Currently, most models estimate the basic reproduction number to be between [3-5, substantially higher than the WHO’s estimate of 1.4–2.5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246804272030004X).

Should the virus continue to spread in the U.S., we expect Biglaw firms to institute isolation policies and encourage their attorneys to work from home. The good news is that technology has made remote working more productive than ever. In fact, recent studies have shown that remote employees [are more productive](https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html). Deal flow may slow if market turbulence continues, but we expect firms will maintain their status quo in billings and laterals by introducing flexible solutions and realigning priorities. 

We have had lateral candidates seeking to expatriate from China, asked to observe a 14-day domestic quarantine before interviewing to ensure the virus is not spread. As an interconnected recruiting firm with a global full-service platform, we make use of a plethora of different technology platforms including a proprietary video conferencing solution to facilitate the type of effective communication that twenty years ago, was only possible by sharing an office. We will work with our law firm clients to ensure their strategic goals are accomplished, even in the wake of a worsening pandemic, by offering our technology platform and comprehensive services in coordinating remote attorney interviews and by offering flexible solutions through our sister company [Bridgeline Solutions](https://www.laterallink.com/bridgelinesolutions/) to help firms scale their workforce as needed. 

Part of strategic realignment will likely come with an emphasis on bankruptcy, restructuring, litigation, and labor & employment if demand for corporate work slows. Typically, we see these countercyclical practices buoy firm financials in times of recessions. Assuming we actually do see a recession, firms will pivot their lateral hiring strategy to emphasize these practices, which could impact junior attorneys. 

Lateral Link recruiter [Jon Kahn](https://www.laterallink.com/team/jon-kahn) who survived three recessions as a Biglaw partner and associate retooled his practice to survive the recession. As corporate work dried up in the early 1990s, Jon was forced into Fried Frank’s litigation practice to save his career. Unhappy in the practice, a recruiter approached him and brokered a deal for Jon to join Cahill Gordon as a capital markets attorney, after taking a small experience haircut. We have a long track record of success in moving associates across practice areas and we are happy to help if you are considering a move to another firm or another practice. 

If you are an experienced attorney looking to lateral, time is of the essence. Firm administration is preoccupied with plotting their strategic response to different potential outcomes of the virus life cycle. Consequently, submitting an unsolicited resume right now for a lateral move is a waste of time. We are finely attuned to our law firm client’s needs across the U.S. and globally and we are happy to help you navigate the lateral market in this uncertain time. At the end of the day, though these may be trying times, the world is not ending, and Biglaw will subsist, and as the early Am Law 200 reports indicate, thrive.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Firm Offers Raises Retroactive To July 1
## It's not perfect, but some pretty good news about raises.

A couple weeks ago, we learned that Perkins Coie delivered a cryptic message to its associates about [impending “nuanced” raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/what-the-hell-is-perkins-coie-doing/). What did that even mean? We’re talking about raises, not becoming a Go grand champion! Hell, we’re not even talking about becoming a Pokémon Go grand champion.

Last week, while I was off listening to substantive Supreme Court talk and writing pieces like [this](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-liberal-argument-against-the-supreme-court/) and [this](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/like-it-or-not-the-left-still-loves-the-supreme-court/), Perkins Coie went ahead and issued raises for its offices. And yet none of our tipsters were dishing out any specifics.

This brings me to an aside for law firm management teams: go ahead and put out a memo. This whole cloak and dagger hogwash just makes you look silly. We’re going to find out anyway, so be upfront if you’re matching, and don’t try to sugar coat it if you’re not. Keeping a lid on this stuff only increases the risk that recruits and laterals develop the wrong impression of the firm. Own who you are!

Back to the story. So, Perkins Coie doesn’t put out a memo and offers salary bumps that vary across offices, so it’s taken some time to get a full picture, but here’s basically what we know:

Two Bay Area offices are full Cravath matches.

So San Francisco and Palo Alto are matching the $180K scale up to — one presumes — at least $315K.

Major markets are full Cravath 1-4 years, then ranges 5-8 with top end being Cravath.

Presumably “major markets” excludes the two Bay Area offices that we just covered. Without knowing the exact requirements of each range, it looks like this keeps almost everyone on the Cravath scale (hours requirements at Perkins Coie haven’t traditionally been draconian).

One smaller market office actually got an interesting offer:

Seattle was given a choice of staying on 1800 [ed. note, another tipster says the correct number is 1850] minimum billable requirement or moving to 1950. If 1950, then major market scale.

There’s your work/life balance! UPDATE: Pics of the whole scale, for either hour total, [available here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/firm-offers-raises-retroactive-to-july-1/2/).

One last bit of happy news — all raises are retroactive to July 1. None of that “wait until October” garbage here.

On the other hand…

But they expressly said merit bonuses would be impacted and we may not even get bonuses — so that’s sh**ty.

Indeed.

But it wouldn’t be very “nuanced” if you got everything you wanted.

(Seattle ranges available on the next page…)

# The Former Biglaw Partner In Jeffrey Epstein's Private Calendar
## She now says 'I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein.'

Jeffrey Epstein

The Wall Street Journal [did a deep dive](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeffrey-epstein-calendar-cia-director-goldman-sachs-noam-chomsky-c9f6a3ff) on the private documents and calendars of Jeffrey Epstein. The documents span 2013 to 2017 — well after Epstein was already a convicted sex offender for crimes involving a teenage girl. The list of folks seemingly happy to give Epstein reintegration into polite society is long, with notable names from government, academia, and finance. But what caught Above the Law’s attention is a former Biglaw attorney’s name.

Kathryn Ruemmler has had quite the legal career. The former [White House counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/06/musical-chairs-bob-bauer-out-and-kathy-ruemmler-in-as-white-house-counsel/) under President Barack Obama, she was a partner at Latham & Watkins and co-chair of its white-collar defense group. In 2020 Ruemmler left Biglaw for the in-house world at Goldman Sachs, where she currently serves as Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel. And in the 2010s she repeatedly met with Epstein.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

According to a spokesperson at Goldman, Epstein and Ruemmler’s relationship was a professional one that she maintained in connection with her role at Latham. Though a spokesperson for the Biglaw firm says Epstein was never a client of Latham’s, Ruemmler says he was a professional contact and Epstein introduced her to potential clients. She now says, “I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein.”

Over the next few years, Ms. Ruemmler, then a partner specializing in white-collar defense at Latham & Watkins, had more than three dozen appointments with Epstein, including for lunches and dinners.

“In the normal course, Epstein also invited her to meetings and social gatherings, introduced her to other business contacts and made referrals,” the Goldman spokesman said. “It was the same kinds of contacts and engagements she had with other contacts and clients.”

Ruemmler first met Epstein when he called and asked if she’d be interested in Bill Gates and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. A Gates spokesperson now says Epstein misrepresented their relationship and that he regrets ever meeting him. However, at least one of the introductions Epstein facilitated led to a representation for Latham:

Epstein also connected Ms. Ruemmler with Ariane de Rothschild, who is now chief executive of the Swiss private bank Edmond de Rothschild Group. The bank hired Ms. Ruemmler’s law firm, Latham & Watkins, after the introduction to help with U.S. regulatory matters, according to the bank and the Goldman spokesman.

According to the reporting, Epstein appeared to have taken the time and effort to cultivate his relationships with the elite:

The documents show that Epstein appeared to know some of his guests well. He asked for avocado sushi rolls to be on hand when meeting with Ms. Ruemmler, according to the documents. He visited apartments she was considering buying. In October 2014, Epstein knew her travel plans and told an assistant to look into her flight. “See if there is a first class seat,” he wrote, “if so upgrade her.”

In 2014, Epstein called Ms. Ruemmler within weeks of her leaving the Obama White House. Epstein planned a lunch in August 2014 at his townhouse, followed by a series of meetings to introduce her to a wider circle of his acquaintances.

Which seems to have included hiding away aspects of Epstein’s life that could be troubling:

Epstein and his staff discussed whether Ms. Ruemmler, now 52, would be uncomfortable with the presence of young women who worked as assistants and staffers at the townhouse, the documents show. Women emailed Epstein on two occasions to ask if they should avoid the home while Ms. Ruemmler was there. Epstein told one of the women he didn’t want her around, and another that it wasn’t a problem, the documents show.

Ms. Ruemmler didn’t see anything that would lead her to be concerned at the townhouse and didn’t express any concern, the Goldman spokesman said.

Epstein’s documents also show he planned to fly with Ruemmler and in 2017 even planned a stop at his home in the U.S. Virgin Islands for the day. But Ruemmler never visited his island and “never accepted an invitation or an opportunity to fly with Jeffrey Epstein anywhere,” according to the Goldman rep.

Money. I love it. You love it. And this bonus season, you’re probably expecting more.

The wait is over.

[Two weeks ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/dla-piper-bonus-2021/), DLA Piper released its bonus table — a welcome announcement considering that the firm has had a habit of issuing black box bonuses. Thankfully, they are continuing the trend of transparency. After Biglaw firms began to change their bonuses to be closer to what Davis Polk is offering, DLA has decided to follow suit. Here’s what you can expect.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  


It must be hard to figure out what to do with all that extra money coming your way. Maybe you can get that Roomba you’ve been putting off? I know it makes no sense that your floor is messy when you’re barely even home, and yet it moves.

(Turn to the next page to see the DLA Piper memo.)

We like hearing about bonuses almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Where Are Younger Lawyers' Priorities? Let's Ask
## Maybe somebody should ask millennial lawyers what they actually think.

Members of the millennial generation already make up the largest portion of the U.S. workforce. Their unique working style often leaves older generations scratching their heads, as millennials take a nontraditional approach to the day-to-day. They are the first generation strongly tied to technology and more influenced by social media than mainstream media outlets. Understanding how millennials work and what they want to reach a positive work/life balance is a priority for the business world.

In partnership with our friends at [Major Lindsey & Africa](https://www.mlaglobal.com/), we wanted to dig deeper into the dynamics of this apparent cultural change in law firms. Starting today, we are running a series of (very brief) surveys designed to capture the perspective of the youngest cohort of lawyers. What differentiates them from both their generational peers and their older colleagues?

Today’s [survey ](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_4OzUN8zptWf6EQd)(the first of four) concerns “[Priorities](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_4OzUN8zptWf6EQd).” Please take a couple of minutes and [share your thoughts here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_4OzUN8zptWf6EQd). (Please note we are not exclusively interested in hearing from millennials; lawyers of all ages are encouraged to take [the survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_4OzUN8zptWf6EQd).)

# Paul Weiss Press Release Captures Everything Broken About Biglaw In One Image
## Biglaw can't solve this problem until it sees it. This image suggests that may still be a ways off.

Let’s play a sort of flashcard game, shall we? Take a quick look at this press release from Paul Weiss announcing their new partners and consider the first thing you see:



Did your mind first focus on the venerable firm’s 2018 commitment to putting the white in white shoe? Or, putting aside the monochromatic palette, did you notice that there is only one woman, and she’s visually consigned to bottom billing? Perhaps you noticed nothing at all, which is also an acceptable answer because everyone in the legal industry is so accustomed to images like this that they appear innocuous.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

But Paul Weiss has a serious diversity problem and it’s deeper than just not finding any diverse candidates for partnership.

The legal industry’s diversity woes remain rampant. While corporate America posts relatively significant strides toward diversifying its executive ranks on all fronts — a strategy that directly addresses the implicit and explicit biases that historically limited the talent pool by excluding candidates unnecessarily —  the legal industry seems mired a few decades behind. When it comes to naming partners, women and minorities seem nowhere to be found.

It’s not that firms intentionally want their letterhead to feature more white dudes than a Jimmy Buffett concert. Very few law firms set out to cultivate a class bereft of diversity. Rather, they lack imagination and mindlessly hew to a model that grinds most candidates out of the process before it ever reaches this point. Diverse candidates are subtly shunted off into auxiliary roles — counselships or whatever sanitized terminology the firm uses. Implicit biases consistently [drive down minority candidate reviews](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/proof-that-typos-are-racist/). Women are held back for deigning to have kids. And corporate America’s relatively more progressive hiring poaches quality diverse candidates to the in-house ranks. This isn’t a problem that gets solved the day the firm votes on new partners, it needs to be addressed on the day first-year associates start.

But worse than the firm’s failure to find and nurture diverse candidates for partnership, is the naked lack of awareness involved in putting that picture out into the world as a press release. When the resulting image looks like this, someone, somewhere along the line needs to show a modicum of awareness and say, “oof, maybe let’s not put pictures with this one.” The post evinces a complete failure to recognize what’s happening.

Speaking of a lack of imagination, the reason the only woman in the class is appended to the end of the image is that she comes last alphabetically. Was there any reason to list these attorneys alphabetically? Could making the firm not look like it’s mired in the 1950s be a worthy enough goal to justify toying with the layout a little? While writing this, another Biglaw firm sent along its partnership announcement and it isn’t alphabetical and a big reason why appears to be to keep women partners from falling to the bottom of the list.

That’s what’s really broken about the diversity of Biglaw. It’s not even that the firms have thoroughly hamstrung efforts to put diverse candidates in a position to succeed, it’s that no one can look at an image like this and immediately see the problem. Paul Weiss can’t put a two-paragraph letter into the ether without five edits. This image was labored over. The blind spot that allows this to get through the multiple checks Biglaw firms set up for every decision is the ultimate affront to the campaign for diversity.

Biglaw can’t solve the problem unless it sees it.

Let’s be clear that these partners don’t deserve to have their announcement be emblematic of the firm’s overarching failings. That they aren’t joined in this image by new partners that would demonstrate a successful diversity initiative isn’t their fault.

Though, next year, it will be on them. Hopefully, they can use this experience to help the firm do better.

# Law Firm Involves Police After Fired Attorney Sends Threatening Messages
## Lawyers at the firm -- and their children -- have gotten harassing messages from their former colleague.

In 2020, international law firm [Walker Morris](https://www.walkermorris.co.uk/) fired an attorney for gross misconduct. The lawyer, identified as BL, worked at the firm for five years when he was let go. In 2023, BL began contacting his former colleagues with threatening messages.

As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-walker-morris-granted-injunction-against-abusive-sacked-lawyer) Roll on Friday:

One frightening message from BL said, “The violence is inevitable, it’s just making sure I get the right person and family. So you can imagine how much violence is about to ensue”.

The firm reported him to the police, but the threats continued.

BL even began contacting the children of Walker Morris lawyers, sending them abusive messages accusing them of involvement in a bizarre conspiracy. In one message to a woman in her early 20s who is the daughter of a senior Walker Morris lawyer, he wrote, “Why are you and your dad hacking my phone and stopping me working in law…weird little cunt”.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The threats continued despite the best efforts of the firm. Earlier this week the firm received an injunction against BL to stop him from sending these messages. However, even right before the hearing BL continued his campaign of harassing messages.

Indicating that compliance may be an issue, before the hearing BL sent an email to a Walker Morris leader copying in other staff which stated, “that all you got Hitler?”

A spokesperson for the firm commented, “In order to ensure the safety of our people and due to the ongoing actions of the individual, we were left with no option but to involve the police and obtain an injunction. Given the ongoing police investigation and pending litigation, we cannot comment further.”

# Be Prepared: More Layoffs Are Coming Down The Pipeline

Every firm is looking at staffing, with the intention of a head-count reduction. Law firms had more staff than they needed even prior to COVID. Working from home made clear that some staff weren’t busy. Also, lawyers have learned to do things on their own that they used to rely on other people for help with. It’s an overdue and appropriate business reaction.

— Altman Weil principal [Eric Seeger](http://www.altmanweil.com/Seeger/), commenting on the fact that there are [certain to be more layoffs ahead](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/09/02/more-cuts-coming-as-firms-slim-down-to-keep-partner-pockets-full/). Seeger says he’s spoken to about three dozen managing partners over the past month, and they’re all looking to trim down headcount at their firms. “[I]n an uncertain environment, they don’t want to let a crisis go to waste,” says Zeughauser Group consultant [Kent Zimmermann](https://www.consultzg.com/people/kent-zimmermann/).

# How To Elevate Your Legal Career As A Trusted Business Partner
## Use technology to free yourself from menial duties and elevate your legal career.

“I got into this field because I love the law. Evaluating word variations and sentence constructions in thousands of contracts every year is the ideal way for me to contribute to its advancement,” said no lawyer ever.

Is contract review really the high-impact work you set out to do when you began your legal career? Probably not. You can leverage your legal knowledge and become a valued business partner to your company in many other valuable ways. 

Yet, contracts still must be drafted with precision and reviewed with care. Like the devil, high risk and high reward lie in the details. Legal issues must still be resolved, and managing them requires much effort. These will always be job No. 1 for in-house lawyers.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

But you’re not stuck with the way things have always been. Today, you can automate a significant portion of your daily legal tasks. Use technology to free yourself from menial duties and elevate your legal career. Perform meaningful work that positions you as a trusted business partner rather than a contract-crunching legal clerk. 

Focus On The Big Picture And Add Value At Every Point

Invest in your professional development and personal enrichment on a broader scale to maximize your full potential. First, formulate a big-picture plan that simultaneously supports the goals of your legal department and organization. Structure this big-picture plan in ways that empower you, your team, and the business to achieve short-term wins, middle-range goals, and long-term aspirations.  

In painting your big-picture plan, seek to build business value at every stroke. Ask how you can innovate to enhance your company’s operations. How can you better align your legal department with the company’s strategic goals?

As you gain new technological skills, legal experience, and business acumen, consider how to apply this knowledge to identify business opportunities and address risks in the changing digital world. For example:   

- Web3 is shifting businesses toward decentralization and changing how people engage with companies. Will your organization move to a decentralized approach? Will its partners? How will this affect your responsibilities?
- People, devices, and processes connect in more ways than ever before. What connections should you establish and where? How can the connections benefit you and your organization? 
- AI has advanced far beyond just automating tasks and processes. AI now solves real-world business problems and creates value in areas such as compliance, supply chain, and risk management. How will you use AI to elevate your role and add value to your organization? 
Leave the humdrum tasks to automation. Elevate your goals and strategies to focus on legal and business value. Track and measure their impact to understand the effects on your company’s bottom line, setting the stage for higher performance, productivity, and profitability. 

Then, you will find yourself leading critical organizational discussions that also lead your career to the next level.

Are you automating and elevating?

# Summer Associate Survey Reveals These MoFos Run A Great Summer Program
## Most summers don't report having a lot of fun but there are clear exceptions.

Summer associates have left the warm embrace of — well, I was going to say lengthy lunches and baseball games, but with COVID who knows what programs do anymore? In any event, students are returning the reality of watching their student debt pile up as they sit through “Law and French Impressionism” until they can start studying for the bar exam. How did the 2021 edition of the COVID summer program turn out for everyone? Law360 Pulse just released the second part of its Summer Associate Survey this morning and it breaks down the season with the help of 751 summer associate respondents.

Law360 did this survey in two parts, with [a spring installment](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/what-summer-associates-are-saying-about-the-2021-program/) that asked law students about the upcoming summer before it even started. At the time, summers really wished they’d get in to Latham, Kirkland, and Skadden in order. After going through the programs, there’s a new top 30 of firm summer programs as ranked by associates. Here’s the top 10:

Absent from that list are Latham, Kirkland, and Skadden. Looks like those MoFos know how to run a program.

It’s good to see my old firm setting up in that number 2 slot. It’s been a while since Cleary hosted [Aquagirl](https://nypost.com/2018/07/12/top-firms-change-up-outings-to-avoid-boozy-disasters/) and that’s still the top story people think of when it comes to the program. Hopefully this can change the narrative a bit and remind people that the Financial District can still provide a great summer experience without involving the Coast Guard.

That said, the respondents might not be seeing the full picture all that well:

Hilarious. It’s not that the summer program doesn’t expose you to good work and get you prepared to effectively contribute to a high end legal team, it’s that it gives you one or two of those projects when your career will involve you doing 12 of them simultaneously. I’m confident that 86 percent of respondents didn’t think about that.



This is the saddest takeaway from the COVID summer experience. We’re big believers in the legal industry adopting hybrid work models that take advantage of tech infrastructure, but this is what’s missing from a true in-person working world. Hearings and depositions don’t always need to be held in-person, but as a learning experience, remote versions of these crucible events don’t really get the job done. The idea that almost half of all summers never went to anything like this is just sad.

As for social time, the survey finds people were about equally split on whether or not the whole experience amounted to “fun.”

That’s not encouraging. Surveys like these haven’t always existed, but I think historically one would find 60 to 70 percent of respondents in the generally fun camp. Hopefully 2022 can be a bit more positive for everyone.

There’s a lot more in this report too, so check it out.

Earlier this week, we told you about the mental health issues law students at Columbia Law School were experiencing, and how the law school’s administration was making it worse. That story had a positive result, with the powers-that-be at the law school changing course and making structural adaptations to help relieve the stressors on students. But, as we said at the time, Above the Law was certain CLS wasn’t the only school with this issue brewing. Turns out University of Michigan Law School students are pissed at their administration over the lack of support for mental health issues during the pandemic.

Let’s start with the background information: in a student-produced survey, 89 percent of the student-respondents agreed with the statement, “I am worried about my mental health.” Plus an overwhelming 90 percent pointed the finger at the law school agreeing that “the law school has not done enough to support students this semester.” Yikes.

In an [opinion piece](https://www.michigandaily.com/section/columns/michigan-laws-administration-offers-little-compassion-pandemic) for student newspaper The Michigan Daily, Jessie Mitchell calls the Fall 2020 semester “downright hellish” for many law students, saying that structural decisions by the administration exacerbated the challenges law students.

In addition to eliminating Fall Break, the Law School also added weekend classes for the fall semester. Unlike the rest of the University, which held classes online after Thanksgiving break, the law school condensed its schedule by holding its last class the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.

The reason the law school made the compressed schedule was, in a roundabout way, thanks to Biglaw. Since COVID-19 pushed most law schools’ early interview week from the fall to January 2021, the shorter schedule was designed to allow students to have their fall grades in hand before the interview process. Imagine interviewing for the most important job of your life with three whole semesters’ worth of grades in hand! The mind boggles. In any event, Dean Gil Seinfeld notes that the condensed schedule wasn’t ideal but, “All things considered however, this seems the best way to balance the competing needs of our student body.”

Except, was this really the best or only way to get the desired result?

Third-year Law School student Julia Adams disagreed. She argued that the school year could have started a week earlier — an approach adopted by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State. Or professors could have been asked to grade a little bit faster this year. The school should have “put the onus on the people being paid,” Adams said, instead of putting students on the “chopping block.”

And, you know, though Biglaw will figure into many students’ post-graduation plans, it’s far from everyone’s A-plan. But still, everyone had to submit to the immovable force of Biglaw.

The changes to the schedule were far from popular, and the administration did rejigger some things:

After much student advocacy in October 2020, the Law School did make some small changes. Students were given the option to change one grade of a C or higher in both the fall 2020 and winter 2021 term to a “P.” The exam period was also extended, pushed from ending on Dec. 11 to Dec. 14, with professors encouraged to allow students to take their exams at any time within that period.

But a current 3L told Mitchell that the process of changing the administration felt, at times like “trauma porn,” where law students were functionally forced to disclose personal information to see results. Additionally, the law students Mitchell spoke with say the mental health initiatives the law school’s pushing aren’t cutting it:

[R]epeated suggestions from the school about yoga and CAPS [Counseling And Psychological Services] felt insulting in the face of more structural issues facing students.

# Associates Are In No Rush To Return To The Office For Biglaw's 'Culture'
## Biglaw leaders are promoting their culture as a reason to return to the office. Associates wonder why.

It’s not that most associates don’t want to ever go back to the office. It’s that people don’t enjoy the culture. [Most firms] don’t really have an intentional culture, except ‘being best’—and that’s not much of a culture. You’re stuck in some partner’s office where they don’t make eye contact. Or you walk by a partner who doesn’t acknowledge you—which is especially true for minority associates. Working remotely removes that social stress; it’s less emotional work.

— Lauren Skerrett, an associate at Kirkland & Ellis, commenting on one of the reasons why associates [aren’t too excited about returning to the office](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/is-firm-culture-a-good-reason-to-return-to-the-office) in the “post”-pandemic world. Skerrett has written for Above the Law about the experience of being a Black lawyer in Biglaw. Click [here](https://abovethelaw.com/author/lskerrett/) to see her columns.

# Law School Grads See Best Job Outcomes In 12 Years -- But Not Black Grads
## Disheartening news on the diversity and inclusion front.

It took more than a decade for it to happen, but employment outcomes for law school graduates are now even better than they were before the recession. The class of 2019 had a truly excellent showing — for almost everyone but Black graduates. In a year that’s been marked by a reckoning on racial inequality in America, this really stings.

As we [noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/record-breaking-employment-rate-for-law-school-class-of-2019-stopped-dead-in-its-tracks-by-pandemic/) previously, according to the latest figures from the National Association of Law Placement (NALP), the class of 2019’s employment outcomes were very strong. The overall graduate employment increased to 90.3 percent (0.9 percentage points over the class of 2018), which is the highest employment rate recorded since the the class of 2007 saw an overall rate of 91.9 percent. On top of that, the number of graduates employed in full-time, long-term jobs where bar passage was required was 74.3 percent (an increase of more than 3 percentage points), a percentage higher than rates measured before the recession. It’s actually the highest level ever recorded.

But for minority law school graduates, this data paints a much more dismal picture. Despite the fact that law firms have focused on diversity and inclusion in recent years, for the class of 2019, Black and Native American law school graduates had the lowest overall employment rates. In fact, Black graduates were employed in bar passage-required jobs at a rate 17 percentage points lower than their white classmates.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
NALP Executive Director James Leipold acknowledged this news in a [press release](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/PressReleases/NALPPressReleaseJobsandJDsOctober212020.pdf):

I find it particularly discouraging this year to have to report employment findings that highlight stark disparities by race and ethnicity, among other demographic markers, but this should serve as a wake-up call to everyone involved in legal education and the legal profession. In a year when the overall class secured jobs and salaries at higher rates than we have seen since before the Great Recession, many subsets of graduates, but especially Black law school graduates, still meet with lower levels of success in the job market than the rest of the graduate pool.

How do we solve the diversity and inclusion issues that remain in private practice? When white law school graduates are finding jobs that require bar passage at a rate of 79.8 percent and their Black colleagues trail behind at 62.4 percent, it’s clear that whatever law firms think they’re doing to improve diversity and inclusion is still not enough. It’s disheartening to see these kinds of numbers, and even though it’s difficult to remain hopeful for the future, with Generation Z optimism taking over law schools across the country, change is on the horizon.

Law students have started to boycott law firms for their policies and practices, and it seems to be working. The power is truly in law students’ hands to change things. Take up this issue and help bring much-needed progress and change to the legal profession.

# Navigating The Negotiation Traps: 5 Factors To Consider
## A career as a lawyer is a career based on negotiation -- so here's how to negotiate successfully.

“Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.”
— John F. Kennedy

Choosing a career as a lawyer, whether litigious or transactional, means you’ve chosen a career based around negotiation. The main obstacles to negotiations are simple; they are yourself and your counterparty. You will want one outcome, they will want another outcome, and where you end up depends on you and it depends on them.

Here are the things I consider (in order) before I negotiate for clients:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
1. What;
2. How;
3. Who;
4. Why; and
5. When and Where.

1. What

First of all, I work out what my client wants from the negotiation. It’s that straightforward, and it always stays at the forefront of my mind. As a transactional lawyer, I have clients who more often than not simply want to execute a deal, and my job is to facilitate that in a way that minimises risk. Other times a client will tell me that a deal is contingent on getting certain assurances or concessions, and I know that them making money or growing their business is reliant on us ensuring we get the counterparties to deliver those assurances or concessions.

Trap No. 1: The greatest trap for the “What” is getting mired in detail. At any point in the process of the negotiation, you need to be able to take a mental time out and ask yourself, “Will this help get what we need or want?”, and then ask, “Does the client care about this?” If the answer to both questions is no, it is time to move on.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Trap No. 2: The second greatest trap for the “What” is saying, “We would never agree to [X]”. I don’t say “never” in negotiations, it’s a dangerous word that can come back to haunt you. I sometimes say “can’t” or “won’t” on my clients’ behalf if they have a rationale for not wanting to do something or being constrained from it for whatever reason, but I never say “never.” After all, things can change, the market changes, people change, and each negotiation is different from the next.

2. How

“How” is just as important as “what”, and it’s purely personal. I constantly consider how I want to be perceived by people on the other side of my negotiation and the impact on my reputation if I choose to take certain negotiating styles. I consider how my client will be perceived if I take certain positions on their behalf and once I have reconciled my thoughts around perception, I come to a conclusion about how far I am prepared to go and what I am prepared to do and say to get what the client wants from their negotiation.

Trap No. 1: Not compromising your hard boundaries. For example, I find it to be really poor form when a more senior lawyer doesn’t respect a more junior lawyer on the other side in a negotiation based on seniority alone. It happens quite often as the legal profession is extremely hierarchical. For me, it’s a hard boundary to ridicule someone openly in a professional environment and I just won’t do it. There are other better ways to manoeuvre when a junior lawyer on the opposing team is being difficult or getting things wrong, and making them feel small is not smart. One day that junior lawyer may be a client or they may be seated opposite you as a senior lawyer in another negotiation and you won’t want to look back and remember the cheap shot you took at them with regret.

Trap No. 2: Not being versatile with your styles. Subject to not compromising hard boundaries, you do need to adapt your negotiation styles to suit the audience. I have the joy of having clients in the same institutions who need to be approached with different styles and who want me to approach the opposition with different styles. If I am facing a collaborative audience, I might be quite assertive around the points my client wants to win in the hope that they will respond collaboratively. Conversely, if I am opposite someone assertive, I try and chop and change my style between collaborative, analytical and assertive, taking extreme care about how often I show assertiveness in order to try and keep the negotiation open.

3. Who

It is critical to know who you are negotiating with. My absolute pet hate is being dragged onto a last-minute call or into a meeting where I don’t know who will be there. Negotiating blind is very difficult, it puts you on the back-foot and you should avoid it at all costs. In order to get the most from your negotiation, find out who will be opposite you, what their role is, and how much decision-making power they have.

Trap: The blindsiding game. It happens all the time to unwitting trainees or associates when their counterparty says, “I’ll just conference in [my more senior associate/partner]” and that trainee or associate becomes a sitting duck on a call where they thought the power balance of the discussion was going to be fairly equal. In a market where reputation is of paramount importance, few junior lawyers want to be seen by a partner or senior lawyer to be unreasonable, obstructive, aggressive, or just plain wrong. As the dynamics of who conducts a negotiation are relevant to the outcome, I would always consider declining the offer of being outnumbered and suggest re-convening when you can arrange for the playing field to be levelled.

4. Why

You negotiate to persuade people to move their position. The question of why you negotiate is related to, but different from, what you want from your negotiation. For example, I might wake up one day and want to buy a new car. I know I want a new car, I know why I want it, and I know that I have a certain amount of money to spend and a certain amount of time to look for it. When I enter the car show room, the car sales person only knows one of four of those pieces of key information. They know I want to buy a new car. They do not know why, they don’t know my budget, and they don’t know my time limitations. That is the information that could make the difference to them making a sale to me or not, and for me it is the difference in the price I end up paying.

Trap No. 1: The first “why” trap is giving away too much information that will allow the counterparty to narrow your scope for negotiation leverage.

Trap No. 2: The second “why” trap is not using your power of negotiation (in the car sales person’s shoes) to draw out relevant information from the other side. This can be a complex process, and it is vital to create a connection of some form and empathise with the person you are engaged with. Asking them questions unrelated to the negotiation (such as about their day, their holidays, their children) will start to draw conversation out and create a rapport. Statistics suggest that people are highly more likely to transact with people they like. Further, it is helpful to consistently use repetition and summarise people’s positions to change juncture. Believe it or not, expressing someone else’s position clearly can assist your own position greatly. Having them agree to your summarisation can be the first positive step to reaching a collaborative solution because you have formed agreement on what their position is and there is more chance of them agreeing to move in your direction once you have sought some form of positive sentiment from them.

5. When & Where

When and where you hold your negotiation goes to the initial planning stage of any negotiation. If you want to get the most from your negotiation, it is crucial to check that your opposition has enough time to spend engaging with you. You should over-estimate the time your negotiation will take, because you may have to spend longer than you think drawing out information or analysing the response to positions. If a negotiation is to be conducted face to face, a lot can be implied from where a negotiation is held.

Trap No. 1: Allowing someone on the other side to use time against you is a common trap. I have lost count of the times someone has said to me that they don’t have time to discuss issues because the deal has to close by midnight on X date or else. There’s always the inclination to question why, if the deal is so important to that person, they left it so late to put it in place! Find out whether people are providing false deadlines (it’s commonly the case).

Trap No. 2: There are certain advantages to being able to host a face-to-face negotiation and set up a room to suit your plans for running the negotiation, so always work out if hosting is feasible and take the opportunity to reap strategic benefits of doing so.

Not all lawyers are good negotiators; it is a skill to be consistently practised and honed, but those most able to listen, to question intelligently, and to read body language can become masterful negotiators over time.

If the polar vortex and the [President’s idiotic tweets ](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1090074254010404864)on the subject haven’t distracted you, you’re probably aware that the Super Bowl is this weekend. It features what is probably the least exciting matchup of all time — the dominant and detestable New England Patriots and the team without a fan base, the Rams. But I’ve made the Super Bowl a de facto national holiday too long, since well before the treatment of Colin Kaepernick and the specter of CTE made the NFL problematic, to not take notice of the event.

So, this morning when [Slate’s Ben Mathis-Lilley published an interview](https://slate.com/culture/2019/01/patriots-fan-interview-super-bowl.html) with a Pats fan on what it’s like to be hated for your fandom I took notice. Sure, it’s the “poor little rich girl” of sports takes, but what can I say? The allure of procrastination is strong.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

But I sat up and took notice during the introduction of the interview subject:

I spoke to one such chowderhead, 37-year-old Boston attorney Nathaniel Adams, about what it’s like to root for a team that much of the rest of the country is sick of—and whether there are diminishing returns on the joy of victory when victory is all you know.

Hmm, an attorney you say? Perhaps this foray into sports news was not procrastination at all, but research for my actual job. And so, like any blogger worth their salt, I took the .3 seconds needed to google that… and of fucking course, the guy [is a Skadden attorney](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/a/adams-nathaniel).

Reading between the lines of the interview, there are parallels between his time in Biglaw and being a member of Pats nation. After all, it take a certain constitution to navigate the vitriol of opposing counsel and of Chiefs fans. On the subject of being hated, Adams says he doesn’t take it personally:

You understand that people have various reasons for disliking a team. Some of them are good, some of them are, I think, not so good. But it just comes with the territory of being a sports fan, so I don’t take it personally when I’m a subject of vile personal attacks.

He may not take it personally, but he also took the opportunity to make a dig at the haters — painting them as “vile” without details on what he’s referring to so we can make a judgment call for ourselves. +1 lawyering.

Adams, despite being a mergers & acquisitions attorney, goes on to answer some of the interview questions like a seasoned litigator responding to interrogatories — objecting to the question and admitting nothing:

Q: What do you think are some of the valid criticisms of the Patriots? Do you have a positive case that people should actually admire them?

A: I’m not going to offer anything that I think is admirable about the team [as a whole], because I don’t know if there’s anything particularly admirable about any sports team. I also think that criticisms of the team are a little silly and probably petty and born of jealousy. But I think that the general air of discontent or dissatisfaction around the Patriots has more to do with the way they are treated in the media.

Admittedly, I have a pretty low threshold for listening to Pats fans opine on their team, but I perked up when Adams was asked if losing to Eli Manning in the Super Bowl — twice — still hurt:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The fact that it was Manning is really annoying. Even the 18–1 season, I think I and most fans have moved beyond that, but it would’ve been really cool if they had won, and there were some players on that team that it would’ve been really awesome if they got the ring with the Patriots. Like [Randy] Moss and [Wes] Welker, Junior Seau was on that team.

Listen I am a big Giants fan. And as far as I’m concerned they can wheel Eli Manning’s geriatric ass onto the field into the Ocasio-Cortez administration for one reason. Well, two: Super Bowl XLII and XLVI. The G-Men were the only thing standing between the Patriots and an undefeated season and all the insufferable smugness of their fan base, and a grateful nation thanks them for their ability to get the job done. Somehow it helps the 5-11 season knowing that still stings Pats fans.

Speaking of sports stings, the worst part of the Falcons falling apart in the second half of Super Bowl LI was knowing that it made Donald Trump happy. Maybe some Pats fans would prefer not to be painted with the same brush as MAGA hat wearers, but when your owner, head coach, and QB are stanning for the President, well, you have to deal. But Adams reveals he’d rather the only conversations about the Pats be about how great the Pats are. Good luck with that:

Q: Does the fact that Donald Trump has become a part of the storyline of the team take anything away as a fan—seeing Brady, Belichick, and Kraft popping into these unpleasant, heated national news stories?

A: [Pause for comic effect in the manner of Belichick glaring at a reporter who asked a question he doesn’t want to answer.] Yeah, we’re really just focused on the Rams game.

Not to get into my own personal beliefs, but it’s, I’d say, more annoying than anything because it becomes a sideshow to what you want the story to be, which is “our team is awesome.” And so anything that distracts from that, and I guess you could put something like Deflategate in that category too, anything that gives people a reason to talk about the team but not lavish praise on them for being incredible, is something that grates on you.

So you only want to hear praise… that’s not how any of the things work. I mean, Rowdy Roddy Piper was a tremendous wrestler and athlete and yet [his obituary](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11805888/Rowdy-Roddy-Piper-wrestler-obituary.html) refers to him as the “greatest ‘heel'” in the WWE. You just have to take that as part of the faustian deal the Pats have seemingly made.

And you’d think someone at Skadden would get how it works. It’s a dominant entity in its field that churns through the cogs that makes the machine run. It’s a strategy that has worked for Skadden — receiving the designation as the one of the [“Fearsome Foursome”](https://www.bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/37-law-firms-most-feared-in-litigation) of law firms, considered the most feared law firms in the country. According to the BTI Consulting Fearsome ranking the firms at the top — like Skadden — are known for legal teams that “want to start off with a show of force. They bring a lot of talented attorneys to bear early and come on strong. This initial surge lets the other side know they are in for a bigger fight than they ever dreamed—and their client is wildly committed to getting the outcome they want.”

The parallels between Biglaw life and the Pats are getting just a little too close for comfort.

I know Adams’s team is probably going to add to their legacy on Sunday. But in the face of such repeated successes you have two options: the first, which, based on my limited experiences is almost impossible for a Pats fan, is to cheer for your team with quiet dignity — no one gloats when Team USA wipes the floor with the Lithuanians in men’s basketball. The other is to develop a thick skin. The criticisms of the team aren’t likely to decrease just because they add another championship to their trophy case.

The women coming out of law school pay attention to whether there are women in management, whether there are women who are the leads in their practice groups, whether there are women with significant client relationships who are getting in the pitch rooms and landing the business. It means something to them to have that trajectory and have something to aim for — to see women in those positions.

# Judge Garaufis Placated By Kirkland & Ellis And Facebook

In our [reader poll](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/was-this-judges-reprimand-of-kirkland-ellis-justified/), 96 percent of you agreed with my view that Judge Nicholas Garaufis (E.D.N.Y.) acted inappropriately when he [harshly reprimanded](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/judge-reams-junior-associate-because-biglaw-firm-refused-to-send-a-partner-to-court/) a third-year associate at a status conference for Kirkland & Ellis’s failure to send a partner to cover the hearing. [FN1]

And maybe that 96 percent includes Judge Garaufis himself? From a report by Nate Raymond of [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-lawsuit-idUSKCN11X2K5):

The judge on Tuesday apologized to the extent his comments may have sounded like criticism of the associate, but said he was concerned about whether Facebook’s lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis LLP were taking the matter seriously.

“We heard you loud and clear, and we apologize,” Craig Primis, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, told Garaufis.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Craig Primis is a [longtime Kirkland partner](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=8994) who came up for the hearing from D.C. — and he wasn’t even the person who traveled the farthest for the hearing. As noted by Christine Simmons of [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/09/27/federal-judge-facebook-and-kirkland-make-amends-in-court/?kw=Federal%20Judge%2C%20Facebook%20and%20Kirkland%20Make%20Amends%20in%20Court&cn=20160927&pt=Afternoon%20Update&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20Recorder&slreturn=20160827194340), Facebook had no less than five lawyers in court today for this status conference — including deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, who came all the way from California for the proceedings.

(Bringing Grewal is, as I said on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DavidLat/status/780848122528468992), pretty perfect. When he was a magistrate judge before joining Facebook, he was a [strong advocate](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/judge-delivers-stinging-rebuke-to-partners-for-freezing-out-associates/) for giving young lawyers the [opportunity to speak](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/proof-that-law-firms-dont-really-care-about-associate-development/) in open court.)

This (expensive) gaggle of lawyers — Primis, Grewal, K&E partners [Shireen Barday](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=10467) and [K. Winn Allen](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=10110), and [Aulden Burcher-DuPont](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=11515), the associate who got the original tongue-lashing — [placated Judge Garaufis](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/09/27/federal-judge-facebook-and-kirkland-make-amends-in-court/?kw=Federal%20Judge%2C%20Facebook%20and%20Kirkland%20Make%20Amends%20in%20Court&cn=20160927&pt=Afternoon%20Update&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20Recorder&slreturn=20160827194340):

“Any inference that might have been achieved through the media that I was ever upset at Mr. Burcher is totally unfounded, and for that I apologize, if that’s the impression that was given,” Garaufis said Tuesday.

We reached out to Facebook for comment. A spokesperson confirmed the presence of Grewal and Primis at the hearing and said that oral arguments are set for January 19.

So all’s well that ends well. Kirkland and Facebook apologized to Judge Garaufis, Judge Garaufis apologized to them, and Facebook reassured the judge that it takes very seriously its obligation to make sure its platform is not used to incite terrorism (the subject matter of the underlying lawsuit).

This is an outcome that everyone can “like.”

[FN1] Kirkland does things differently — see, e.g., how early it makes non-share “partners” — and that’s true of promotion as well. A source pointed out to us that even though he’s a 2013 law school graduate, Aulden Burcher-DuPont is actually a “fourth-year” associate in K&E-speak, because promotions happen in September at Kirkland. (He’s not a first-year associate, as erroneously reported in various places, even if he’s in his first year at Kirkland; he lateraled to K&E after two years at Mayer Brown.)

This source, who has worked with Burcher-DuPont, added that he is a superb young lawyer and did not deserve the treatment he received last week.

UPDATE (9/28/2016, 1:30 p.m.): Neither Kirkland nor Facebook has said a bad word about Judge Garaufis, but not everyone who appears before him shows such restraint. Over at the [Robing Room](http://www.therobingroom.com/Judge.aspx?ID=8#comments), he has an average rating of 3.8 (out of 10).

Thanks to the pandemic, Biglaw firms have been on a roller coaster complete with very high highs (bigger and better salaries, bonuses, and perks) and very low lows (salary cuts, layoffs, and furloughs) ever since 2020. Throughout these tumultuous times, law firms have attempted to maintain their brands — the image they want clients to see when making hiring decisions and their overall reputations in the marketplace.

But which Biglaw firm has the best brand in the world? Thanks to the 2022 Global Elite Law Firm Brand Index, you’re about to find out.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Thomson Reuters ranks Biglaw firms based on feedback from their most important clients, general counsel at the world’s largest multinational organizations. Here’s how the survey was conducted:

The main survey incorporates more than 50 questions designed to gather clients’ insight into such areas as law firm brand, firm usage, and legal market trends. The responses are distilled down into four different and non-related measures….

• Top-of-mind awareness — This is based on the first five law firms that come to a survey respondent’s mind, captured in order of mention, with up to five firm names captured.
• Favorability — This is based on which three law firms that survey respondents said they feel most favorable towards, with up to three firms captured in order of mention.
• Consideration for multi-jurisdictional litigation — This represents up to three firms that survey respondents said they are most likely to consider for litigation work across three or more countries, captured in order of mention.
• Consideration for multi-jurisdictional deals — This represents up to three firms that survey respondents said they are most likely to consider for deal-making or mergers & acquisitions work across three or more countries, captured in order of mention.

Biglaw firms have navigated uncharted waters due to COVID-19, and in 2021, corporate clients tended to once again stand by firms they’ve known and worked with for years — especially those with strong M&A practices. Elizabeth Duffy, Senior Director of Global Client Services at Thomson Reuters, noted:

“Looking at this year’s top 20, it is clear that brand favorability and multi-jurisdictional deals have been the most important success factors this year for global law firm brands, out of the four that make up the index.” …

“In 2021, as businesses emerged from the crisis, legal service buying patterns focus on forward facing factors like understanding the client’s business and knowledge of their sector,” Duffy explains. “And we are seeing clients prioritizing specialist expertise over historical relationships or reputation.”

So, which firm is tops when it comes to its global brand? That would be Baker McKenzie, which kept its lock in the #1 spot for the twelfth year in a row. Here are the top firms (with two ties):

1. Baker McKenzie (no change)
2. DLA Piper (no change)
3. Clifford Chance (+2)
4. Dentons (-1)
5. Norton Rose Fulbright (+2)
6. Allen & Overy (+1)
6. Hogan Lovells (-1)
6. Skadden (+8)
9. King & Wood Mallesons (+2)
9. Latham & Watkins (+8)
9. Linklaters (-5)

Click [here](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/global-elite-law-firm-brand-index-2022/) to access the complete ranking of the Top 20.

Once again, this ranking speaks volumes as to which Biglaw firms are on top when it comes to client loyalty, but there are just a few U.S.-based firms among the ranks of the Global Elite. What does this say about our lawyers? Our Biglaw firms might be doing something right, but surely there’s a way to do things differently to propel additional firms to success.

# Riding The Design Wave
## Because design patent cases often involve competitors, there is perhaps an enhanced chance, absent settlement, for design patent disputes to get all the way up to the Federal Circuit for review.

As I have said on these pages [before](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/design-patents-are-different/), design patents are different. In that 2020 column, I noted research showing that the most common litigation pairing when it comes to the parties in a design patent infringement case involves small or medium competitors. Because design patent cases often involve competitors, there is perhaps an enhanced chance, absent settlement, for design patent disputes to get all the way up to the Federal Circuit for review. When that happens, as it did last week, the usual result is an important[ decision](http://cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/21-2299.OPINION.9-15-2023_2190910.pdf) with broad impact on design patent jurisprudence. Last week’s decision in Columbia v. Seirus wears the “important” description well, at least as measured by the rare [multiple](https://patentlyo.com/patent/2023/09/federal-circuit-egyptian.html)–[post](https://patentlyo.com/patent/2023/09/relevant-confusion-infringement.html) treatment on Patently-O.com that the Federal Circuit’s opinion garnered.

For those with an interest in design patents, the most recent Federal Circuit ruling is just the latest legal event in this long-running dispute. Back in 2019, an earlier panel had reversed a grant of summary judgment of infringement in Columbia’s favor “for two reasons: (1) the court improperly declined to consider the effect of Seirus’s logo in its infringement analysis and (2) the court resolved a series of disputed fact issues, in some instances relying  on an incorrect standard, that should have been tried to a jury.” As a result of that reversal, Columbia’s $3 million verdict was wiped away as well, with the case going back to the district court for a new trial. In that post-remand trial, Seirus secured a verdict of non-infringement, which Columbia appealed. But rather than attack the jury’s verdict, often a losing proposition on appeal, Columbia chose to challenge the jury instructions, as well as the district court’s decision to preclude Columbia from challenging the comparison prior art on the grounds that it was not directed to heat-reflective material, but rather just to the broader category of fabric.

To start, the Federal Circuit panel dealt with some arguments by both sides regarding potential waiver of arguments based on the outcome of the original appeal, before turning to “Columbia’s challenges to (1) the jury instructions (and exclusion of evidence and argument) concerning comparison prior art and (2) the jury instructions implicating Seirus’s logo.” On the former, the panel noted “the proper scope of comparison prior art that may be used in an infringement analysis is an issue of first impression for this court.” On balance, therefore, the panel concluded that “using the same scope for anticipatory prior art and comparison prior art makes good practical sense” as the best way of finding answers when “close questions may arise as to the relationship between a given article of manufacture and what the claim identifies.” Here, the jury verdict could not stand because the jury instructions did not incorporate the legal standard that the Federal Circuit had just determined was the appropriate one. In other words, the trial was retroactively deemed premature, since the proper standard on comparison prior art was not yet articulated. In this case, where Columbia argued that the relevant prior art had to come from the universe of articles that encompassed heat-reflective material, as opposed to any type of fabric, the incomplete jury instruction was thus prejudicial. Having tossed the jury verdict, the panel charged the district court on remand to figure out what articles of manufacture contain the requisite heat-reflective material, a determination that when reached could be dispositive to the infringement question based on its potential bearing on the comparison prior art that would remain.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Next, the panel turned to the question of whether the district court’s jury instruction went far enough in terms of making clear to the jury that “consumer confusion as to source is irrelevant for design-patent infringement, or that likelihood of confusion (in addition to actual confusion) need not be found.” Here, the panel disagreed with Columbia that such a far-reaching instruction was necessary. It did so even as it expressed that it could “appreciate the potential for a jury to be led astray and mistakenly conflate the significance of a logo’s source-identifying function with whatever impact it might have on a comparison of the designs.” Still, the jury instruction here, which set forth the proper legal test for design patent infringement, while also instructing the jury that they did not need to find actual confusion in order to find infringement passed muster.

Lastly, the panel punted on the question of scope of damages, as like in the first Columbia decision, the Federal Circuit’s ruling on appeal left the infringement issue unsettled.

Ultimately, this latest decision will likely continue to generate additional discussion from the design patent community. It will be interesting to see whether the parties themselves decide that they have had enough of the fight — as each has now won below only to see the Federal Circuit reverse — or whether they will continue the battle. Either way, their mutual contribution to design patent jurisprudence is a substantial one. Future design patent litigants will benefit from Columbia and Seirus’s willingness to ride the design wave up and down to the Federal Circuit multiple times.

(N.B. I was a recent guest on the [Loyal Littles Podcast](https://overcast.fm/+mC-o2l1Oc), where I discussed my journey into IP, writing this column, and of course my longstanding relationship from afar with Tony Kornheiser. Thanks to Chuck and Roxy for having me on and for taking the time to bring people with shared interests together.)

Yesterday, the employment law boutique law firm, Wigdor Law, was sued in New York state court. The firm was accused by the plaintiff, billionaire Leon Black, of malicious prosecution of a civil claim. Wigdor represents Black’s former mistress, Guzel Ganieva, who accused Black of abusing her during their relationship. The firm filed a lawsuit on Ganieva’s behalf against Black, but that was ultimately dismissed, due to a non-disclosure agreement.

That lawsuit Black faced is the basis of the new lawsuit he filed against Wigdor. (UPDATE: This is actually the third time Black has sue the Wigdor firm. The first, filed in October of 2021 has since been dismissed. The second was filed in December of 2022.) According [to reports](https://www.ft.com/content/7136ca12-487b-419e-b621-594a93fa2720), the complaint alleges that the firm pursued the allegations against Black “even after it knew the allegations were demonstrably false” and “threaten[ed] to file baseless, unsubstantiated lawsuits if he did not kowtow to Wigdor’s exorbitant demands.”

The complaint goes on to detail “Wigdor History of Questionable Ethics”:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
According to the complaint, “[Wigdor] has a unique business model: it threatens to sue defendants with scandalous allegations that can be avoided only at the cost of a large settlement, of which Wigdor takes a substantial cut.”

In this lawsuit, Black is represented by Quinn Emanuel and partner [Michael Carlinsky.](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/carlinsky-michael-b/)

Wigdor has denied the allegations in what one might characterize as a traditional manner, with partner Jeanne Christensen saying the lawsuit is “frivolous” and “meant to scare and warn other women, and lawyers who may represent them.” Adding, “Sadly, there are always lawyers willing to file such nonsense when someone like Leon Black is paying the hourly rates.”

But the firm has also taken to social media to fight the fight.

As detailed on their Twitter/X account, they’ve indicated they’re in possession of communications from Carlinsky that indicate a positive working relationship, quite different than you’d expect since he called the firm out on their “questionable ethics.”

Entertaining that [@quinnemanuel](https://twitter.com/quinnemanuel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) partner Mike Carlinsky would sign a complaint alleging “Wigdor History of Questionable Ethics” when we have emails and other communications from him asking Wigdor for personal favors [#CarlinskyBlackEpstein](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CarlinskyBlackEpstein?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#anythingformoney](https://twitter.com/hashtag/anythingformoney?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#questionableethics](https://twitter.com/hashtag/questionableethics?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

And they continue.

Sounds like Carlinsky and [@quinnemanuel](https://twitter.com/quinnemanuel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) have been bought off by Leon Black, the same guy who secretly paid $62.5mm to USVI and $158mm to Epstein and is now under Senate investigation.

Indeed, the firm [says](https://twitter.com/WigdorLaw/status/1691479901503721472?s=20), “Starting tomorrow and continuing daily we will be rolling out these emails. Stay tuned.”

Well, we’re intrigued and will definitely have to watch to see how the story develops.

UPDATE: Michael Carlinsky has issued a statement in response:

“It’s disappointing that Wigdor would engage in these unprofessional tactics. I admired firm co-founder Ken Thompson and referred cases to Ken and Doug. But after Ken left the firm, in 2021 I stopped considering them for referrals, because I became concerned the firm had lost its way. This sorry episode confirms that.”

# 7 Key Considerations For Lawyers Negotiating Contracts For AI Services
## Human lawyers will always be crucial for ensuring contracts and licensing agreements related to AI systems and services are comprehensive, clear, and adhere to relevant laws and regulations.

“ChatGPT did a great job reviewing my software contract. It will save me so much on legal fees from now on!” a business professional, John, recently told me.

John had run a contract between his company and an AI-powered software vendor through ChatGPT and asked it to pull out the top three areas of concern. He then sent everything to his lawyer for review.

“My lawyer agreed with ChatGPT’s conclusions on two issues. She then explained that the third issue was a judgment call,” John said. “Sure, she added a few things, but I think with ChatGPT, I can handle software contracts myself now.”

“Are you worried about the privacy of your agreement? Or liability issues?” I asked.

“Not as concerned as I am about overspending on legal fees,” John said. 

John’s response highlights a vexing dilemma posed by AI language models like ChatGPT. These tools can display a convincing level of analytical capability that seems indistinguishable from a lawyer’s. But technology-related laws and regulations are highly complex and heavily nuanced. New legal cases and technological discoveries emerge regularly, changing the rules suddenly and unpredictably. 

Human lawyers will always be crucial for ensuring contracts and licensing agreements related to AI systems and services are comprehensive, clear, and adhere to relevant laws and regulations. Negotiations involve many rights and legal issues, including:

Licensing And Usage Rights

A contract for an AI service or system should outline the specific terms of licensing and usage rights granted. Are your rights exclusive? Are there restrictions on sublicensing or the geographic territories where AI services can be used? Include provisions for any limitations on technology modifications and requirements for software updates. 

These rights tie closely with the intellectual property rights your contract may also need to cover.

Intellectual Property Rights

Ownership and protection of IP rights are primary concerns in AI-related agreements. Technology patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets can be complex and difficult to delineate. Nonetheless, contracts should clearly define each party’s IP rights, as well as any improvements or derivatives stemming from its use. Adequate safeguards should protect those rights throughout the contract’s term.  

Data Privacy And Security

The data sets used to develop AI models can include confidential and sensitive information that requires compliance with privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States. 

Review data privacy clauses to ensure vendors comply with all applicable privacy laws, including data access controls and encryption standards. Clarify which party is responsible for obtaining user consent, managing data breaches, and ensuring appropriate security measures are in place.

Liability For AI Decisions

AI systems can potentially cause harm or losses due to their autonomous decision-making capabilities. Who should be responsible for potential damages or errors — the developer, the user, or the AI system? Addressing liability for harm caused by an AI system’s actions or decisions can include establishing a clear indemnification structure, stating which party is responsible for damages arising from AI-generated decisions, and establishing processes to rectify errors or system failures. 

Increasing transparency into and explainability of AI systems can help mitigate liability risks, which gives you two more contract aspects to consider.

Transparency And Explainability

AI systems may rely on complex algorithms and large datasets that raise concerns about transparency and accountability for their decision-making processes. Consider adding provisions that address transparency requirements like algorithmic disclosures and access to information explaining how AI makes decisions.

Because transparency and explainability can increase under consistent scrutiny, performance metrics are another essential consideration in your contract’s terms.

Performance Metrics

Vendors make powerful claims about their AI system’s capabilities. Can they back them up? Establish performance metrics for success measures. Specify acceptable levels of accuracy and reliability that accurately reflect the real-world performance of the AI system. Make metrics clear, measurable, and attainable to prevent disagreements and avoid disputes later. 

A quality assurance framework outlines each party’s responsibility for monitoring performance, ensuring compliance, and addressing discrepancies. Yet, even the happiest of partnerships can end, so make sure to give termination clauses attention, too.

Termination Clauses

The AI landscape is evolving rapidly. Conditions change with new technological advancements and amendments to regulations. To avoid disputes when your relationship ends, ensure your termination clauses outline processes for handling IP or data rights and establishes knowledge transfer protocols. 

Do you think ChatGPT could handle your AI contract negotiations?

Have you used an AI language model during contract negotiations? 

Do you rely on AI-enabled contract management software for even greater value during and after negotiations?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

We knew the pendulum would start to swing back after we set low tide marks the last couple of quarters.

— William Josten, manager for enterprise legal content at the Thomson Reuters Institute, in comments given to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/law-firm-financials-heading-right-direction-report-finds-2023-05-08/), on the results of the latest [Law Firm Financial Index](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/lffi-q1-2023-divergent-recovery/), which tracks key financial metrics across large and midsize law firms. The LFFI rose 14 points in 2023’s first quarter, the first increase since the second quarter of 2021, with demand up by 0.1%, while rates surged by ~5.5%.

# 3 IP Takeaways From The 2023 LF Dealmakers Forum

Before writing this year’s recap of the recent LF Dealmakers [event](https://lf.dealmakersforums.com/agenda/), held in New York City a few weeks ago, I decided to take a look at my [column](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/3-ip-takeaways-from-the-2022-lf-dealmakers-forum/) on the 2022 edition of this well-regarded industry event. In truth, a lot of what I said last year still holds true, especially in terms of the place that LF Dealmakers continues to hold as a major event in the busy fall conference calendar for litigation finance professionals.

Once again, I was lucky enough to get a press pass to the event, in my capacity as your trusty IP columnist. This year, I was able to attend a few panels in person, as well as a panel or two of particular interest via recordings on the event’s virtual platform more recently. As usual, there was plenty of relevant discussion to IP lawyers and their clients — and I think the industry is already at the point where the relevance of litigation funding, particularly for those focused on patent litigation, is a fact that we can take the equivalent of judicial notice of. Put another way, the discussion at this year’s LF Dealmakers confirms how relevant litigation funding is in today’s IP litigation field, with a reach that is waxing, not waning.

As with prior recaps, this is in no way a full distillation of all of the content at LF Dealmakers. For that content, or for the just-as-valuable networking opportunities, I recommend reading whatever in-depth coverage of the event can be found or, even better, consider attending in person. At the same time, I hope the following takeaways will help impart some of the flavor of the event, with a focus on the issues most relevant to IP practitioners.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
First, the increased importance of the burgeoning litigation insurance market to the IP ecosystem can’t be overstated. In last year’s column, I claimed that “it is not too early to say that the development of an insurance market for litigation finance is unfolding before our eyes.” Having had first-hand exposure to the insurance market over the past year, I have personal knowledge of the truth of that statement. Anyone who attended this year’s LF Dealmakers was treated to an in-depth look at the applicability of insurance to a wide variety of IP litigation funding scenarios. Leading the pack, for now, is the availability and use of what is called judgment preservation insurance, whereby successful patent plaintiffs, for example, can insure a healthy percentage of any verdicts they are fortunate enough to garner through their enforcement efforts. Insuring patent verdicts is something that is becoming increasingly commonplace, in part because it is easier to assess or price risk post-judgment than at the start of a patent case.

That is not to say, however, that other types of insurance products are not gaining traction in terms of funded patent enforcement campaigns. Other options discussed included at least the two following ways that insurance could be used to benefit funders or claimants pursuing patent cases. While both would involve plenty of diligence by the insurer or insurers, the benefits of each would more than likely justify the cost of that diligence — when, as is standard, that cost is passed on to the prospective insured. One way to deploy insurance to benefit a litigation funder, for example, would be for a funder to insure a basket of cases at the early or middle stages of development. Ideally, that basket would be diversified, not only in terms of having different cases or groups of cases involving disparate targets or technology areas, but also in terms of the progress of the underlying cases themselves along the litigation track. Another insurance product that was spotlighted at LF Dealmakers was the option for IP owners to perhaps insure a prospective return from licensing or enforcing their patents over a period of years and then using that policy to attract the funding needed to pull off those enforcement efforts. Clearly, insurance companies, as long as they continue to pay claims in a timely manner and offer bespoke products to help funders and IP owners, will continue to seize an even more important role in the years to come.

Second, while insurance was an important and well-discussed topic, it was also interesting to consider the continued lack of discussion around the performance of existing investments by litigation funders, particularly with respect to patent litigation campaigns they have backed. Everyone acknowledges that the amount of diligence that goes into the decision to fund a given patent case is extensive, if not harder than ever, now that funders are more experienced in assessing a wider swath of variables that could impact on the performance of their patent litigation investments. Add in the additional layers of diligence required to pursue insurance midstream, if that is of interest to a funder, and there is no doubt that funded patent cases are among the most vetted cases around. Still, there are a lot of ways to lose a patent case, as compared to the often narrow path to victory, which can diminish the value over time of pre-suit diligence, while enhancing the importance over time of active management of a funded patent case in terms of getting to the best possible result. For passive funders, however, the latter role is something that is by definition entrusted to the funded clients, as informed by their trusted counsel. Yes, funders price for that lack of control when structuring deals. But they also face the challenge of having to sit around and trust that the patent cases they have funded are being managed optimally by others. What impact that has on their returns and success rates is something that will perhaps be addressed in future conferences, as more funded patent cases see their way to some kind of resolution on the merits.

Lastly, it remains important for IP lawyers and their clients to appreciate the challenges that funders face when trying to handicap patent cases. In one very telling comment, a panelist at LF Dealmakers commented that one of the four-letter words in the funding industry is “duration” — meaning how long it takes for an investment to generate a return. Ask a litigator, and it is likely you will be told that as long as it takes to get a win is a proper duration for a case. There is a good chance that a funded client would say the same thing, especially considering that they are usually dependent on getting that big win in order to have the funds to pay the funder back in the first place. Likewise, insurance companies are more than happy to collect insurance premiums today in exchange for a long runway until a claim can be made against a given policy. For funders, however, there can be huge opportunity (and other) costs associated with investments that take longer to pay off than originally anticipated. Sure, there are ways to price for duration risk, and sophisticated funders build that risk into their funding models and agreements. But there is also no doubt that funders would love to see their investments pay off sooner rather than later, thereby rendering duration risk a moot point.

Ultimately, LF Dealmakers continues to mirror the increasing sophistication and development of litigation finance as an asset class and field of professional interest for so many talented lawyers and financial folks. There is plenty more to discuss, but hopefully the above will hold this audience over until the next event of interest to those in the IP community for whom litigation finance is of continued interest.

# Firms Are Using Acting To Get Their Associates To Write Better Emails
## Is this what our Law Revue winners go on to do with their lives?

Once I learn how to write a coherent email, it’s over for you.

You ever get that feeling that a couple members of your cohort weren’t the most aware folks in the bunch? Sure, they had good grades and all, but their people skills were a little behind on the curve. If you thought they were bad, imagine a generation of issue spotters whose main interaction with cold calls and group projects was mediated by Zoom. Things have gotten to the point where big names at reputable law firms have realized that even the almighty billable hour needs to take a backseat to employees who struggle with civility and communication. From Law.com:

Debevoise deputy presiding partner Nicole Mesard is the co-chair of the firm’s global talent initiative, charged with making sure associates have the appropriate “experience” at the firm. As part of that, Mesard wants to make sure her associates have been taught a range of soft skills to help them progress in their careers.

…

Mesard said “drama-infused” training sessions, where attorneys essentially role-play scenarios, are helpful in training attorneys on how to deal with complicated, uncomfortable or contentious situations.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
These “drama-infused” scenarios are meant to train young attorneys on how to actively listen, communicate clearly via email, and negotiate. As it turns out, yelling “Me right, you wrong!” and responding to opposing counsel with block quotes from a 2006 Corporations outline will only get you so far. Isn’t it weird that there is no necessary connection between being a person who did well enough in law school to get employed by a top 100 Biglaw firm and not being proficient at writing clear emails or communicating with one’s clients? It is almost as if law school is a six-figure training program that mints degrees for its students without preparing them for the basic, real-world interactions one would expect of the vocation. It has got to be difficult zealously representing one’s client when you struggle communicating with them or with opposing counsel over email, after all.

Annemargaret Connolly, Weil professional development committee co-chair, said some of what attorneys learned in law school needs to be augmented in order to communicate effectively with business clients.

“In law school, we write these long, detailed answers to questions, but our clients might want something more concise. We want to be true advisers, not merely lawyers,” she said.

Connolly said that the expectation for those hired by Weil is that the candidates are smart and driven, but so are most of the candidates for a Big Law job. The marketplace differentiation lies in what comes next.

A bold suggestion — maybe firms should gauge for conversational aptitude, civility, and clarity in communication? Some form of background check to make sure that the applicant adequately walks the line of being familiar enough with civil procedure while also making sure that they’re the type of person who returns the supermarket cart when they’re done with it? As silly as that sounds, it makes sense when one of the areas associates seem to be lacking is in the empathy department.

“There is basic blocking and tackling, like following up on things, owning up to mistakes and being proactive,” [Mesard] said. “But you have to go deeper. We have to think about what our client’s goals are. What sort of speed of execution are they looking for? What is their culture and self-image? These skills become more critical as you become more senior.”

As expected, late on the last night of his presidency, Donald Trump issued a swath a pardons, and, there are lots of things to be said about those he chose to absolve. (And he wasn’t done wielding his pardon power — he added Al Pirro to the pardon list with minutes left in his presidency.) Though this list did not (thankfully) include himself or his family on the list, there are some notable names. Of particular note for the legal industry is the pardon of former Nixon Peabody partner, [David Tamman](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/david-tamman/).

Tamman was convicted in 2012 in connection with a Ponzi scheme that was alleged to defraud investors to the tune of $22 million. And he was sentenced to seven years for his crimes. As [reported by ](https://www.law.com/2021/01/20/convicted-ex-nixon-peabody-partner-was-among-latest-trump-pardon-recipients/)Law.com:

His license to practice law was suspended earlier in 2013 by the California State Bar, the Justice Department said. Tamman, [represented](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/04/03/13-50463.pdf) by Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, appealed the sentence. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit [upheld it in 2015](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/almID/1202722873914/exnixon-peabody-partners-prison-term-upheld-by-ninth-circuit/). Tamman was released from federal custody in February 2019.

Ah, there it is. Tamman’s connection to Alan Dershowitz — one of the few attorneys still willing to be associated with the now former president. No wonder Tamman was on the pardon list.

At the time of his conviction, Nixon Peabody said Tamman “betrayed our trust, and failed to live up to the ethical standards our firm demands.” Before his conviction Tamman said he was [“thrown under the bus”](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/10/lawsuit-of-the-day-everyones-a-loser-in-tamman-v-nixon-peabody/) by the firm.

According to the White House, Tamman’s pardon was also supported by former FBI Director Louis Freeh and former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Kendall Coffey. And the statement went on to note:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Mr. Tamman accepts full responsibility for his actions and numerous friends and colleagues have attested that he is a decent man who experienced a terrible lapse in judgment for which he has already paid a significant price,” the Trump White House said.

Which is… basically every single criminal, ever. But they’re not connected to Alan Dershowitz, so, they don’t get a pardon.

Lawyers usually have a somewhat detached and professional relationship with their clients. Clients want to know that their counsel is calm and collected, and discussions between clients and their lawyers usually do not raise any eyebrows. However, lawyers and clients often need to deal with extremely personal matters, and passions can be stoked at times. As a result, it is not uncommon for clients to have heated discussions with their clients, and sometimes, this can help solidify the attorney-client relationship.

When I was an associate in Biglaw, I did not have much contact with clients. The partners were expected to communicate with clients and cultivate the connections that were important to securing additional work. Associates usually were expected to do their work with a two-dimensional view of their clients, and we relied on partners for all of the information that might be needed to perform a given task.

When I worked at smaller law firms, I had much more contact with clients. I soon learned that clients are ordinary people like everyone else. They have personalities, gripes, and preferences, about which lawyers should be informed in order to best serve their clients. Since smaller firms interact with smaller clients that might not have a dedicated legal team, it is more likely that these shops interact with a wide range of individuals with different personalities. It was in this capacity as a lawyer at smaller firms that I first saw that lawyers can have healthy relationships with their clients even though they may have heated discussions.

The first time I saw this situation was at a mediation shortly after I started working at a smaller law firm. There were a few defendants, and at various times during the mediation, all of the defendants and their counsel were placed in the same room since we needed to mount a joint defense. At one point, the other defendant’s lawyer was talking to his client about the merits of settling a case rather than continuing to litigate the matter to trial eventually. The client did not want to settle the matter out of a deep-seated resentment for the plaintiff, and he was holding up a resolution of the matter out of principle.

The defendant’s lawyer had some harsh words for his client about how it was foolish to continue litigating the case rather than taking a fairly reasonable settlement. Of course, legal fees would continue to accrue as long as the case continued, and there was no certainty of success at trial. The lawyer used some harsh words to describe his distaste for his client’s decision to continue the case, and the discussion got relatively heated, which was awkward for me. Eventually, the matter settled for a reasonable amount of money, and everyone was spared the time and expense of litigating the matter further. I saw the client thank his lawyer later for giving him “tough love” that helped push him toward settling the matter rather than spending resources to continue litigating the case.

Sometimes, lawyers need to show tough love to their clients just to make sure that their clients comply with their legal obligations during litigation. Clients need to respond to discovery demands, sit for depositions, and complete other tasks during the life of a lawsuit. Some clients are difficult and do not want to spend their time completing tasks associated with litigation. This can have significant consequences for the litigation and for their attorney under certain circumstances.

One time, I was working at an insurance defense firm and a client we represented kept failing to provide information or cooperate with the defense of a case. The partner eventually got frustrated with the client’s behavior and chewed him out by phone. This partner also related that this litigant might lose his insurance coverage if he did not cooperate with his counsel, and you could tell the attorney’s frustration by the tone of his voice. Eventually, the litigant started helping out more in the defense of the lawsuit, and this party was able to complete its obligations during the lawsuit. The client eventually thanked his counsel for staying on his back and ensuring that the litigant did what he needed to do in order to defend against the lawsuit.

Of course, in most circumstances, it is important to be calm, collected, and professional when interacting with clients, to show the coolheadedness clients often expect from lawyers. However, in the right circumstances, showing tough love and having heated discussions can fortify the attorney-client relationship and may serve a number of goals.

# Biglaw Firm Says Goodbye To Staff
## Another firm is reducing the ranks of support staff.

Just days after Akin Gump confirmed they were [closing their Austin office](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/biglaw-firm-closing-texas-outpost/), Akin Gump would like to see some of its staff head out the door. Yesterday, the firm announced to staff in several offices, including New York, D.C., and Dallas, that they had an opportunity to participate in a voluntary separation program.

[Reducing the ranks](https://abovethelaw.com/staff-layoffs/) of legal secretaries and other support staff has been a Biglaw trend to watch for a few years now. With more and more technical advances, and lawyers’ increased proficiency with that tech, the need for hordes of staff has just decreased.

Reached for comment, a firm spokesperson responded (emphasis added):

Like many law firms, we are adapting to the shifting support needs required to best serve our clients. To address these needs in a manner that is consistent with our culture, the firm recently announced a voluntary separation program for several U.S. offices whereby qualifying staff in those offices who might otherwise be considering other career or life options are presented with the opportunity to voluntarily depart the firm in exchange for a generous severance package. Regardless of the level of program participation, the firm has no plans to announce involuntary departures.

Akin staffers will be relieved to hear there are no current plans for layoffs. But everyone knows even the best-laid plans can change, and we are hearing folks on the ground are worried about that possibility. As one tipster characterized the buyout program, “Not good. Not good at all.”

People may not like it, but at least it is better than a pink slip.

# The Biglaw Firm Behind The Russian Trolls Indicted In The Mueller Probe
## The decision to go with Biglaw is already paying dividends.

Robert Mueller (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)

If you’ve been following along with the legal twists and turns of the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller, you know that one of the more interesting aspects was the indictment of 13 Russian citizens and three Russian businesses on crimes related to interference in the 2016 presidential election. Conventional wisdom has generally been that none of these entities would ever make an appearance or otherwise acknowledge the proceedings. However, one of the Russian businesses, Concord Management, has tapped a Biglaw firm to rep them in court.

Concord Management has hired Reed Smith as their legal team. Partners [Eric A. Dubelier ](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/professionals/d/dubelier-eric-a)(who according to his firm profile has a practice that focuses on international and domestic regulatory compliance and enforcement matters, white-collar criminal litigation, and civil false claims litigation) and [Katherine J. Seikaly ](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/professionals/s/seikaly-katherine-j)(her practice is in government and internal investigations, regulatory compliance and enforcement matters, and related litigation, with particular focus on the False Claims Act (FCA)) made their appearance on behalf of Concord Management last month. They’ve made a bunch of discovery requests seeking non-public information — and, as Politico [reports](https://www.politico.eu/article/judge-rejects-muellers-request-for-delay-in-russian-troll-farm-case/), the requests seem to be a calculated move:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[T[he move appeared to be a bid to force Mueller’s team to turn over relevant evidence to the Russian firm and perhaps even to bait prosecutors into an embarrassing dismissal in order to avoid disclosing sensitive information.

The prosecution tried to delay the arraignment, saying it was unclear if Concord Management had been properly served. They sought additional briefing on the question of proper service, and additionally brought up concerns that the three businesses indicted are thought to be run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, also indicted in his individual capacity, and known as  Vladimir Putin’s “chef.”

“Until the Court has an opportunity to determine if Concord was properly served, it would be inadvisable to conduct an initial appearance and arraignment at which important rights will be communicated and a plea entertained,” attorneys Jeannie Rhee, Rush Atkinson and Ryan Dickey wrote. “That is especially true in the context of this case, which involves a foreign corporate defendant, controlled by another, individual foreign defendant, that has already demanded production of sensitive intelligence gathering, national security, and foreign affairs information.”

The team from Reed Smith disputed the delay — and used a fancy SAT vocab word to make their point:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Defendant voluntarily appeared through counsel as provided for in [federal rules], and further intends to enter a plea of not guilty. Defendant has not sought a limited appearance nor has it moved to quash the summons. As such, the briefing sought by the Special Counsel’s motion is pettifoggery,” Dubelier and Seikaly wrote.

See, that’s the kind of quality a Biglaw firm brings to the table.

And it seems U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich agreed the government’s position was pettifoggery. On Saturday, she ordered, with no further explanation, that the Wednesday arraignment would continue as scheduled.

Concord Management’s decision to go with Reed Smith is already paying dividends.

“So in the image…” (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)

Robert Mueller is doggedly chasing down multiple vectors of Russian interference in America’s elections in a sweeping probe that’s netted a ton of indictments and plea deals, making it truly disturbing to realize that in 2018 it’s entirely possible to consume only news telling you that none of this has happened and it’s all a witch hunt. Orwell famously envisioned a monolithic state media operation pumping out official disinformation. In reality, the future delivered one cable channel and a loose conglomeration of alternative media conspiracy theorists capable of weaponizing gullibility.

But far more disturbing is the allegation made in a filing yesterday that Mueller’s investigation has turned up some nude selfies. Taking a look at the cast of characters in this investigation and that’s a truly terrifying revelation.

The filing, by Concord Management and Consulting LLC objected to Mueller’s stance that details of some of his investigation methods must be addressed in camera for national security reasons. Considering the thrust of the overall investigation and Concord’s alleged ties to Putin surrogate Evgeny Prigozhin, this probably means some CIA shenanigans were involved in intercepting messages between hostile foreign operatives under surveillance.

But Concord’s filing penned by Reed Smith’s [Eric A. Dubelier](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/professionals/d/dubelier-eric-a) and [Katherine Seikaly](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/professionals/s/seikaly-katherine-j) takes an aggressive tone ripped from Sean Hannity’s nightly monologues, branding Mueller’s inquiry a “first-of-its-kind, make-believe case” and deriding the idea that anything that’s turned up nude selfies could possibly be of national security import, giving the rest of us to the same, “wait, what?” reaction we had when we first heard some dumbass tell us that [Grover dropped an F-Bomb](https://boingboing.net/2018/12/28/the-internet-cant-decide-if.html) (he didn’t).

Could the manner in which he collected a nude selfie really threaten the national security of the United States?

First of all… probably, yeah. Second of all, ew.

Who in this case is running around loading their camera with pictures of their junk? Maria Butina is obviously a suspect because the case against her plays out as some kind of twisted honey pot for some Destro wannabe. But get past Butina and it gets ugly fast.

# Biglaw Associate Unsuspended After Challenging Colleague To Shirtless Brawl While Making Racist Remarks
## Yikes. This still wasn't the best idea....

It seems that Biglaw firms are willing to forgive and forget — even when it comes to the presumably drunken escapades of its employees.

Last fall at Simpson Thacher’s London office, a junior lawyer (who we’ve come to learn was classified as a paralegal at the time) reportedly attended a firm social event where he allegedly confronted an associate of Asian descent and referred to him as “General Chan.” As if the casual racism weren’t enough, the then-paralegal then [ripped his shirt off and challenged the associate to a fight](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/biglaw-attorney-reportedly-suspended-after-making-racist-remarks-and-challenging-associate-to-shirtless-brawl/).

According to [RollOnFriday’s reporting](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-simpson-thacher-lawyer-suspended-shirtless-fight-challenge), the paralegal — who at the time was “on the cusp of becoming an STB associate” — was suspended from his duties while the firm conducted an investigation into the matter. When reached for comment, a firm spokesperson had this to say: “While Simpson Thacher does not comment on the details of personnel matters, the Firm takes any allegations of misconduct seriously.”

Months have passed, and [ROF](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-simpson-thacher-forgives-lawyer-who-tried-fight-colleague) now has an update on the situation:

Its findings have been kept confidential, but since then, [the paralegal] has been unsuspended, qualified as a solicitor, and joined the same practice as the gentleman he stripped off to batter.

Talk about awkward. Hopefully the associate in question is willing to forgive his practice group peer’s racist career blunders as easily as the firm was.

# Ted Olson Throws High-Profile Hissy Fit, And Gets Schooled By The ABA
## Olson tries to play the media. Ends up playing himself.

Ted Olson (Photo by Paul Archuleta/FilmMagic)

Ted Olson earned a hefty dose of goodwill from the establishment gatekeepers when he broke with his up-until-that-moment partisanship to fight California’s gay marriage ban. For anyone who followed the law before then, it always seemed a bit unfair that this single act of common sense obscured Olson’s years as the right’s legal hatchet man — at the center of everything from fighting the Office of Independent Counsel for the Reagan administration to serving as Solicitor General for W.’s early years of gutting civil liberties.

Thankfully, this side of Ted Olson has stood up again, throwing a [high-profile hissy fit](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/10/03/ted-olson-is-fired-up-over-abas-kavanaugh-letter-drops-membership/) where he quit the ABA over the ABA President Bob Carlson’s support of an FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“He purports to have the authority to do so under the ABA charter and by-laws. He does not,” Olson wrote. “The members of the ABA do not need his self-appointed leadership on issues of due process and the rule of law or how the Senate Judiciary [Committee] should conduct its constitutionally ordained processes.”

Self-appointed? He won an election. I know Republicans may not understand this anymore, but in the rest of the world, the person who gets the most votes actually gets to be president. Go ahead and add Ted to the list of Republicans who think investigations are bad if they get in the way of unraveling health care. But the best part of this snit, which was transparently staged for the benefit of the legal media — literally the whole story is “Ted Olson told the National Law Journal so we would have to publish it” — is that Olson is flat wrong about every level of his complaint.

ABA executive director Jack Rives said Tuesday, “I’ve got the greatest respect for Ted Olson, who has been a longtime friend and supporter of the ABA. But in this case, the president does have the authority under our bylaw 29.2 as the principal spokesperson for the association.”

So much for textualism.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But Tony Mauro and Ellis Kim are professionals and their write-up of this stunt is not without some sly comedy:

Miguel Estrada, a colleague of Olson’s at Gibson Dunn, agreed with Olson that “it certainly seemed as if [Carlson] was trying to arrogate to himself authority he has not demonstrated he has to take sides in a partisan fight. People consider leaving when the ABA does that.”

That would be Miguel Estrada… the guy whose unsuccessful nomination to the federal bench featured in the documents that Kavanaugh pretty clearly [lied about under oath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-perjured-himself-impeachment/). It seems so quaint in light of the present context, but a couple weeks ago we were talking about Kavanaugh claiming he’d never seen stolen emails that he absolutely saw. Throwing him in this story underlines with a wink how ludicrous this all is.

The record shows that I’m [less than charitable to Jeff Flake](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/senate-judiciary-committee-votes-to-delay-confirmation-vote/), but the dude is smart enough to understand that “no, let’s not investigate anything that could be sexual assault” is a dumb hill to die on.

Ted Olson didn’t get that memo. Because — like the man Kavanaugh seeks to replace, Justice Kennedy — Olson remains the same partisan hack he always was but with a soft spot for basic human rights for gay people.

# Biglaw Firm's Plan To Slash Office Space By 20 Percent
## It saves the firm a boatload of money.

Duane Morris chief executive officer Matthew Taylor said the firm is planning on cutting its office space by a whopping 20 percent over the next five years. And they’re in a great position to do so as 75 percent of the firm’s office space leases are due to expire over that time frame. The plan to cut the real estate investment involves smaller partner suites, shared desks, and, of course, more remote work options.

These new plans represent a major cost savings — Taylor said, “That’s opportunity knocking.” As [reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/duane-morris-to-cut-office-space-20-on-remote-work-desk-shares) Bloomberg Law, the plans to cut back on office space are already well underway:

Now at 635 square feet per attorney, Duane Morris plans to reach about 500 square feet per lawyer by 2027, Taylor said. It already shrunk its space by almost half in Wilmington, Del., 35% in Atlanta and 24% in Boston, bringing “major savings.” He said he has an overall cost-saving target in mind though declined to share it.

The firm is moving towards “hot desks” and embracing being “nimble” post-pandemic. And those big, cushy partner offices that were once a staple of Biglaw life? Taylor says they’re a thing of the past.

The firm decided partners didn’t need to have “big, huge” offices anymore, and none have pushed back on that idea, Taylor said. “I have not had one partner complain about the size of their office is smaller,” he said.

And the strategy — along with lots of work in M&A, private equity deals, and trials — resulted in increased revenue last year of $596.5 million, 13 percent over 2020.

# What Do We Talk About When We Talk About Partnership?

Biglaw partnership ain’t what it used to be. That’s the main takeaway from Sara Randazzo’s (fantastic) piece in last Saturday’s Wall Street Journal, [Being a Law Firm Partner Was Once a Job for Life — That Culture Is All but Dead](https://www.wsj.com/articles/being-a-law-firm-partner-was-once-a-job-for-life-that-culture-is-all-but-dead-11565362437). It offers a comprehensive look at the evolution of partnership, and if you’re trying to explain to your non-lawyers friends how Biglaw today isn’t what they think it is, just give them this article.

Of course, for those who work in or around Biglaw, the big picture here is nothing new. But Randazzo’s article, exhaustively reported as well as superbly written, contains juicy tidbits and fun facts that will be news even to industry insiders. Consider the lede, which reveals the range of compensation for equity partners at Kirkland & Ellis:

Four hundred of Kirkland & Ellis LLP’s top lawyers gathered in May at an oceanfront resort in Southern California to toast another banner year.

Kirkland was the highest-grossing law firm in the world for the second year running, earning $3.76 billion in revenue. When a slide flashed on the screen, showing the value of the firm’s shares, the partners in the room quickly did the math. They would be taking home $1.75 million to $15 million.

Not invited were another 560 partners, who were back at the firm’s 15 offices around the world, working. Though outwardly carrying the same title as those lounging poolside in California, they hold no equity in the firm and generally can expect to make $800,000 at most. While a comfortable living, the salary and its implied second-class status is not the reward many expected after striving to join the venerated partnership.

This is life at the modern law firm, where not all partners are created equal, and data and money rule.

Indeed. As Randazzo notes later on in the piece, the “partner pay spread,” or compensation ratio between the highest- and lowest-paid partners at Kirkland, is 43-to-1. Under the more traditional model, followed by the (small and shrinking number of) New York lockstep firms, the ratio is typically 3-to-1 or 4-to-1 at most.

The ratio is 43-to-1 if you consider Kirkland’s non-equity partners — or “non-share partners,” in K&E parlance — to be “partners.” There’s a good argument to be made that a non-equity partner is no partner at all (and Joe Patrice makes it in his own (very astute) commentary on Randazzo’s article, [Repeat After Me, ‘Partnership Without Equity Is Not A Partnership’](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/repeat-after-me-partnership-without-equity-is-not-a-partnership/?rf=1)).

The WSJ article contains several other interesting data points about partner pay (and partner pay spreads) at top law firms:

- At Simpson Thacher, top partners earn roughly $9 million, and the partner pay spread has increased from 4-to-1 to 6-to-1 in recent years.
- Average profits per partner at Fried Frank have doubled since 2013, to more than $3 million last year, and the spread today is now 13-to-1.
- In his strongest years, superstar litigator David Boies — formerly of Cravath, now of of Boies Schiller & Flexner — took home $25 million.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The rise of the non-equity partner has been criticized on a number of grounds. First, as noted in the WSJ piece, it lets equity partners jack up the billing rates of non-equity partners, often to north of $1,000, without having to share the wealth with them (or take a hit in the American Lawyer’s closely watched “profits per partner” or “PPP” rankings, which consider only equity partners).

Second, as argued by [Joe Patrice](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/repeat-after-me-partnership-without-equity-is-not-a-partnership/?rf=1), it’s fundamentally dishonest: “Can’t we all just go back to a reality-based vernacular? If the attorney is not a partner in the enterprise, they are not a ‘partner.’ If attorneys want more recognition for career advancement, then do a better job of branding the importance of the firm’s counsel. This whole thing has gotten out of hand.”

There’s validity to these critiques. But since the non-equity partner role isn’t going away — if anything, it’s on the rise (in 2000, 78 percent of partners were equity partners, while in 2018, only 56 percent were) — let’s consider the advantages, to lawyers and law firms:

1. The cocktail party effect. Lawyers are obsessed with prestige — and it’s far more prestigious to be able to claim at a cocktail party that you’re a “partner,” as opposed to a “counsel” or an “associate.”

Most non-lawyers won’t know the difference. And even if the non-lawyer does know about the divide between equity and non-equity partners, it would be quite gauche for the person to ask, “But are you an equity partner?”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Sometimes you can guess, based on factors like seniority, whether someone is an equity or non-equity partner. But much of the time, it’s a secret known only to the firms (which is why it’s so hard to get good data on diversity, or the lack thereof, in Biglaw equity partnerships).

(Funny aside: I was chatting with a matrimonial lawyer about the WSJ article, and he said that frequently even the spouse of the purported “partner” doesn’t know: “Spouses often think their husband/wife has equity at a firm and then learn, during the divorce litigation, that he/she is basically counsel with a partner title.”)

2. The business development advantage. This is an offshoot of the cocktail party effect. It’s much easier to land clients, especially large corporate clients, if you can introduce yourself as a “partner.”

As a recruiter, I sometimes work with candidates who, based on how long they’ve been practicing, could be counsels or partners. I ask these candidates how strongly they feel about title. Some say it’s not important, but others say — and understandably so — “If I’m going to build a practice, I need to have that ‘partner’ title.”

3. Greater flexibility and a longer runway. The traditional partnership model was “up or out”: if you didn’t make partner after the prescribed period, you had to find yourself another job. The new model of “partnership,” featuring the non-equity role, allows firms to hold on to talented lawyers for longer; these lawyers can continue to service clients, often in niche areas, without worrying about having or building a book of business. (Yes, counsels can do this too — but see the two other advantages of non-equity partnership, supra.)

In the case of laterals, if they come in as non-equity partners, they can have a longer time period (aka “runway”) to build their practice; they don’t immediately need to be super-profitable, as a lockstep firm with super-high PPP might want or expect. This lets firms “take a chance” on a lateral. If the choice is binary — “admit this candidate to your lockstep, single-tier partnership, which will immediately involve paying them $1.5 million a year or more, or pass” — many firms will simply say “pass.” I suspect many candidates would rather be non-equity partners than not at a firm at all.

So, in the end, what should we make of “non-equity partnership”? I used to be fairly negative on it, perhaps because of a youthful snobbery in favor of the Cravaths and Clearys of the world, finding the whole notion déclassé. But as I’ve gotten to learn more about the legal industry, first as a journalist and now as a legal recruiter, I now know that not every firm can be a Cravath or a Cleary (or a Davis or a Debevoise). I now understand how non-equity partnership can be very useful to a law firm’s business model — especially if the firm doesn’t have all the advantages, such as longevity, reputation, and institutional clients, of a Cravath or Cleary.

Maybe an accurate analogue for non-equity partnership is [college grade inflation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomlindsay/2019/03/30/the-other-college-scandal-grade-inflation-has-turned-transcripts-into-monopoly-money/#6f2a08554182): “Sure, it’s a bit of a sham — but does it have any victims?”

Maybe it’s like another staple of Biglaw, the billable hour: “Ridiculous and absurd — but it makes a weird kind of sense.”

Or maybe, just maybe, it’s like something out of [Alice in Wonderland](https://bookriot.com/2017/11/24/alice-in-wonderland-quotes/): “If there’s no meaning in it, that saves a world of trouble, as we needn’t try to find any.”

Disclosure: My praise of the Wall Street Journal article is not disinterested; I’m quoted in it, on the phenomenon of increased lateral movement: “‘If the firm won’t be loyal to you,’ said David Lat, a longtime lawyer and legal blogger turned [recruiter](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/a-departure-memo-from-david-lat-leaving-abovethelaw-joining-lateral-link/), ‘why should you be loyal to the firm?'”

Everyone has come to the conclusion that they can’t start on the regular date, which is the middle of May. There’s a lot of concern about having people travel to summer programs and get on planes. There’s a general feeling that people don’t want to spread the virus from city to city.

Everyone is waiting for someone to lead it off. That’s true all the time, but really more now.

— [Peter Zeughauser](https://www.consultzg.com/people/peter-zeughauser/), a legal strategist, commenting on the [impact that the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/firms-mull-postponements-cancellations-and-telecommuting-for-summer-associate-programs) has had on this year’s summer associate programs. He expects that many law firms will announce the final decisions on their summer programs — whether it will be delayed, held virtually, or held at all — sometime this week.

I’m not retiring!

— Justice [Clarence Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas), repeatedly rejecting the prospect of retiring from the Supreme Court any time soon, during a speaking engagement at [Pepperdine University 46th Annual School of Law Dinner](https://www.pepperdine.edu/newsroom/2019/03/honorable-clarence-thomas-speak-46th-annual-school-law-dinner/). [James Gash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gash), the school’s incoming president, had asked Thomas who he’d like to speak at his retirement party in 20 years, to which the justice assertively responded — “No!” — that he wouldn’t be retiring in 20 years, or even 30 years. Thomas is currently 70 years old.

# The Biglaw Firm That Ended The 5-Day, In-Office Work Week Announces 3 Mandatory In-Office Days
## Office life is about to get a little more regular at this firm.

Back in May 2021, Ropes & Gray announced its vision for a return to work for attorneys, in three phases, effectively ending Biglaw’s preference for associates to spend the bulk of their time in the office. At the time, it was perhaps one of the most flexible post-pandemic reopening plans of them all, and it came from one of the most successful firms in the country.

Since that time, the firm has implemented two more phases of its reopening plan, encouraging associates to spend one to two days in the office each week (which started in February), and then three days in the office each week (which started in March). Now, Ropes is moving ahead in its return-to-office plan by mandating that associates spend three specific days in-office per week.

Why’s that? According to Julie Jones, the firm’s chair, it’s because “[t]hose who do not spend at least three days a week in the office are not getting the full experience of being a Ropes & Gray lawyer — whether it’s being mentored by a colleague, connecting and collaborating with teams, or becoming involved in our larger community.” Here’s some additional detail from her memo:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We have been reflecting on the benefits of having lawyers in the office at least three days each week, and we are seeing that a more coordinated schedule, with maximum overlap amongst colleagues, is key to creating the experiences that build connections and deliver on our teaching and mentoring promise. With that in mind, starting on October 3, we are introducing required office “anchor days,” and designating Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday as the days we will be in the office — together. Of course, many of us will continue to be in the office beyond those days due to client or team needs or personal preference. …

Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday will be our anchor days because they are the days with the highest level of attendance over the last six months. We expect to see you in on those days, absent client and business development needs or occasional personal conflicts that arise in the lives of all professionals. As always, we ask that professionalism and good judgment guide our decision-making. As a global firm operating in 13 offices, we also realize that market-specific conditions may drive variations from time to time.

This makes Ropes & Gray the latest firm to mandate at least three days spent in the office, and the associates we’ve heard from don’t sound too enthused about it. But, let’s remember these lines from the [memo Jones sent out back in 2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/ropes-grays-reopening-plan-puts-an-end-to-the-5-day-in-office-workweek-for-associates/) when speaking about the firm’s reopening plans: “No matter what phase we are in, we endorse flexibility post-pandemic. We don’t expect that we’ll ever mandate a five-day a week in-office environment.” We’ll reiterate this: Ropes is not likely to require that attorneys spend five days in the office, and that’s still something to be celebrated.

Also recall that Ropes & Gray has two more upcoming remote weeks for attorneys in the future: Thanksgiving week (November 21-23), and the Christmas holiday week (December 27-30).

Best of luck to everyone as they return to a more regular office life at the firm.

Eve Tilley-Coulson,[ an associate in Locke Lord’s employment practice](https://www.lockelord.com/professionals/t/tilley-coulson-eve), has gone viral for something besides her legal acumen. That’s because she’s offering a “referral bonus” of $5,000 dollars to anyone that finds her a husband. As she notes in the TikTok,  “If you introduce me to my husband, and I marry him, I will give you $5,000.”

[Tilley-Coulson says](https://nypost.com/2023/07/11/im-offering-a-5000-to-anyone-who-finds-me-a-husband/) the time is right for her to find a husband, and the price tag she’s put on the service seems fair.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  

Eve Tilley-Coulson

“I’ve been single for about five years now, meeting people in person and on the apps,” she explained. “But since COVID, there’s been a weird shift in dating culture — guys don’t approach you in person, and most of the men on apps aren’t swiping to seriously date.

“So I feel like paying $5,000 for a husband who’s vouched for, meets my needs and is ready for a real relationship is totally worth it,” said Tilley-Coulson with a laugh.

But because lawyers gotta lawyer, there’s a [follow-up video that](https://www.tiktok.com/@ebtilley/video/7242191166601448746?_t=8dsoagHjlKl&_r=1) lays out the fine print for those hoping to collect on their matchmaking skillz:

“You get [the $5,000] as soon as the marriage certificate is signed,” said Tilley-Coulson in a subsequent TikTok clip featuring her non-nonsense friend Lara Bahr.

“He has to be eligible,” added Bahr, a lawyer.

“That means he cannot be already married,” she continued. “This can’t be his second wife.”

Tilley-Coulson then outlined her non-negotiables of her hottie-in-holy matrimony, insisting worthy candidates must fall within the age range of 27 to 40, stand 5-foot-11 or taller, boast a witty “British” sense of humor and have strong affinities for sports, animals, and kids.

# These Biglaw Firms Are Officially Diversity Certified
## Year 1 of a system to get Biglaw firms to consider women or minority candidates for leadership roles at the firm.

[A little over a year ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/get-ready-for-the-biglaw-rooney-rule-as-firms-try-to-actually-do-something-about-diversity/?rf=1), a bold idea was formed at a Diversity Lab event, the Women in Law Hackathon. Modeled after the NFL’s Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview a minority candidate for head coach or general manager vacancies, the idea first proposed by Mark Helm, a partner at Munger, Tolles & Olson, was to create a system to encourage Biglaw firms to consider women or minority candidates for leadership roles at the firm.

Named the Mansfield Rule after Arabella Mansfield, the first woman admitted to practice law in the U.S., asks firms to consider two or more candidates who are women or attorneys of color when hiring for leadership and governance roles, promotions to equity partner, and hiring lateral attorneys. And, if the firms can demonstrate 30 percent of the pool for these positions are diverse, they’ll be “Mansfield Certified.” A year later, we have our first official list of Mansfield Certified firms.

A total of 50 firms are in the process of implementing the rule, and in its inaugural year, 41 firms have been Mansfield Certified:

The Diversity Lab is continuing to work with the firms that are working toward this goal.

That so many firms have signed onto the program is seen as a great success, as [reported](https://www.law.com/2018/08/20/diversity-initiative-names-certified-firms-for-women-minority-leadership/) by Law.com:

“Law firms are not typically early adopters on risky endeavors, especially ones where the results will be made public,” said Caren Ulrich Stacy, CEO of the Diversity Lab, which worked with the firms to implement the Mansfield Rule.

“But these 41 firms showed their true desire to boost diversity in leadership by trying something new and tough to implement,” she said.

Another benefit law firms have seen from implementing the rule is documenting just how well they’re doing on questions of diversity:

“The Mansfield Rule has really brought a rigor and discipline to the whole process,” said David Koschik, partner and member of White & Case’s executive committee.

“It’s also caused us to look at situations where we might either not have a female partner or diverse partner in our minds ready for a leadership opportunity [and] it’s caused us to look at why that is,” he said.

Diversity Lab is currently working on Mansfield 2.0, which will expand the rule to include LGBTQ+ attorneys.

# Top Biglaw Firms Targeted In Global Cyberattack
## Not even the most respected Biglaw firms are 'immune' from ransomware attacks.

Several years ago, with sophisticated cyberattacks on the rise, my colleague Joe Patrice [issued this warning](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-ransomware-attack-on-your-firm-is-coming-and-youre-probably-not-prepared/) to law firms across the country: “The ransomware attack on your firm is coming and you’re probably not prepared.” Did anyone listen to him? Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like it.

Three top Biglaw firms were recently targeted in a global cybersecurity incident that’s affected more than 50 global corporations and banks, as well as more than 16 million individuals.

Kirkland & Ellis, K&L Gates, and Proskauer Rose — all top 50 Am Law firms — were victims of the ransomware group known as CL0P’s latest data heist. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/30/kirkland-ellis-kl-gates-proskauer-rose-affected-in-wide-ranging-data-hack/) has additional details:

The hacker’s website was updated throughout June with additional names of organizations whose information hackers claim to have acquired for ransom. Most recent updates from this week revealed that some of the largest law firms in the world were not immune to the attacks.

The group behind the attack, also known as TA505, reportedly began exploiting a vulnerability in file transfer software known as MOVEit, developed by Progress Software, in May, the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency said in a post this month.

“If Kirkland & Ellis Can’t Avoid Cyberattacks,” mourned the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/05/if-kirkland-ellis-cant-avoid-cyberattacks-who-can/) in another headline earlier this week, “Who Can?” If anything, this just goes to show that even the most profitable law firms are not invincible, nor are they “immune” from cybersecurity incidents.

Save yourself and your firm from becoming the next embarrassing headline and take steps now to secure your data.

# How The Legal Industry Will Become Industrial: A Conversation With Axiom CEO Mark Harris
## No one is happy in Biglaw. Someone is doing something about that.

When Mark Harris started Axiom all the way back in 2000, he identified a problem that many Biglaw associates probably still encounter on a day to day basis: no one is happy. Clients aren’t happy because they are paying exorbitant prices due to constantly rising hourly rates and attorneys aren’t happy because of the quality of work and a nonexistent work-life balance. I remember having a conversation with a special counsel in early 2011, just a few months in to my stint in Biglaw, and asking him how the Biglaw firm model could possibly be sustainable. Who needed these fancy offices, personal secretaries and the other inflated costs of Biglaw firms? Why weren’t clients demanding leaner more efficient model and why wasn’t someone building this already?

Somebody was.

It turns out that Mark had [identified this exact issue](http://www.axiomlaw.com/the-big-idea) a good ten years earlier when he was but a baby lawyer at Davis Polk. Together with partner Alec Guettel, he set out on a mission to transform the legal services industry. I recently caught up with Mark by phone and then had a chance to meet up with him in Axiom’s hip, burnt-orange loft in Soho (I assume the coloring has something to do with the fact that Mark graduated from University of Texas School of Law). In both conversations, Mark emphasized over and over again that legal services is stuck in the artisan and apprentice model, while times are changing into the industrial model. Airplanes were once produced by artisans, but now they are built in factories by big companies like Boeing. Mark believes that this shift is the future of the legal industry.

Coronavirus has finally made its way to Manhattan. New York confirmed its first official infection on March 1 in a health care worker who had just returned from a trip to Iran. Governor Andrew Cuomo has said it is now “inevitable” that there will be “community spread” in New York City.

Thankfully, Biglaw firms are prepared.

In our [previous reporting](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/coronavirus-continues-its-chokehold-on-biglaw-causing-some-firms-to-shut-their-doors/) on the burgeoning threat of coronavirus, we noted that Latham — one of the world’s wealthiest law firms, with 2,720 lawyers in 29 cities across 14 countries — had canceled a client reception at the American Museum of Natural History in New York “[o]ut of an abundance of caution.” Now, the firm has decided to cancel its global partners’ meeting. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/02/28/latham-cancels-global-partners-meeting-in-new-york-citing-virus-fears/) has the details:

“After careful consideration, and with the health and well-being of our colleagues and clients foremost in mind, we made the difficult decision to cancel our global partners meeting,” said Richard Trobman, the firm’s chair and managing partner, in a statement. “While we perceive the risks to be small, safety is our first priority, and we thought this decision was in the best interests of all concerned given the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19.” …

Latham’s global footprint includes China, where more than 78,000 people have been infected by the virus, as well as South Korea, Japan and Italy, which have respectively seen at least 600 reported coronavirus cases, according to The New York Times.

Latham isn’t the only firm that’s taking extra steps to protect its workforce in light of the coronavirus outbreak. It’s been reported that Linklaters has instituted a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine for all employees who have traveled to coronavirus hot spots for either work or entertainment.

What is your firm doing to protect its employees from potential exposure to coronavirus? Please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Coronavirus%20Response) or text us (646-820-8477). Stay safe, everyone.

# Latham Still Hasn't Announced Bonuses But Has Offered Associates A Gift Basket!!!
## Remember when the firm caused a COVID outbreak? Good times.

Some firm gifts are terrible. Some firm gifts are awesome. But the cardinal rule of all firm gift-giving is this: after mid-November, do not give ANY gift until announcing bonuses.

At all.

Because it’s tacky. Associates are waiting at their screens for an official, all-hands email to tell them they can finally ward off that student debt collector for another year and then they get an email with a subject line like “Associate Holiday Gift” and open it to find… a fruit basket? The hell?

We’re not teasing on the fruit basket bit either. As one Latham tipster put it: “while Skadden is giving people iPads and Apple pencils and magic keyboards they’re giving us a fucking $65 basket of pears.”

And that’s the thing — [Skadden’s tech gifts](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/skadden-steps-up-to-thank-associates-with-a-different-kind-of-holiday-bonus/) or the [Sidley AirPods](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/everyone-go-back-to-the-office-but-heres-a-firm-branded-toy-for-your-trouble/) are perfectly fine gifts but both of them were dropped on associates before hearing a whiff about bonuses, turning both announcement messages into psychological torture for associates nervously waiting to see what the market will bring. But after getting over the initial shock and horror, at least associates got something cool. Latham associates are… less-than thrilled with their baskets:

Latham & Watkins NY released their holiday gift today and we got gift baskets after they gave people Covid at the holiday party. What a slap in the face. Allegedly Skadden got iPads and Davis Polk got Pelotons last year, but we get a cookie and Covid.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And even though the bonuses themselves aren’t out, the firm informed associates at a meeting last week that the Class of 2021 would not be getting special bonuses. We held off on reporting that because we hoped — for Latham’s sake — that this was just someone speaking out of turn and that the real bonus announcement would properly match Latham’s peers.

But it’s been over a week since that meeting and the firm hasn’t sent out an announcement. Some firms have already sent out TWO bonus announcements this cycle before Latham’s figured out how to fire off one.

Enjoy your pears, everyone!

David M. Bernick (via Paul, Weiss)

According to the latest [Am Law 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/), the partnership over at [Paul, Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/paul-weiss-rifkind-wharton-garrison-llp/) had a very good year in 2015. The firm broke the $4 million mark in [profits per partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/2/), behind only Wachtell Lipton and Quinn Emanuel in that metric, and it’s using that war chest to scoop up some top talent.

Last month, Paul Weiss [hired Scott Barshay away from Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-deeper-dive-into-scott-barshays-move-from-cravath-to-paul-weiss/). Some have argued that the significance of Barshay’s move might have been overstated (see the latest update to our [prior story](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-deeper-dive-into-scott-barshays-move-from-cravath-to-paul-weiss/)), but this week PW unveiled another major hire to keep up the momentum.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Here’s a report from Casey Sullivan of [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/paul-weiss-poaches-former-philip-morris-gc-from-dechert/):

David Bernick, the former general counsel of tobacco giant Philip Morris, has joined Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison as a partner in New York, the firm announced on Tuesday. Bernick, 61, will start work next Monday in its litigation department, focusing on a range of cases, including class actions, mass tort, product liability, white collar defense, antitrust and life sciences litigation.

Bernick counts Dow Chemical as a longtime client and he has also [recently represented](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-13/takata-engineer-refused-to-testify-in-air-bag-failure-lawsuit) Tokyo-based auto parts maker Takata Corp. in defective airbag litigation. Other clients include Abbott Laboratories, ABB of Zurich, Apple, Dow Corning and Babcock & Wilcox Company.

“Everybody knows Paul Weiss,” said Bernick, in an interview. “They are known. It’s not a stuffy brand. It’s a with-it, make-it-happen type brand and very plugged into the financial market generally.”

Bernick has jumped around a bit in recent years. He comes to PW from Dechert, which he joined [less than three years ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/08/musical-chairs-david-bernick-departs-from-boies-schiller/), and before that he was at Boies Schiller [for just a year](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/08/musical-chairs-star-litigator-david-bernick-joins-boies-schiller/). Prior to Boies Schiller, he served as general counsel of Philip Morris International, where he earned a pretty penny in a short stint. He was there for just about two years, but was one of the nation’s highest-paid GCs in both the [2011 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/07/who-are-americas-best-paid-general-counsel/) and [2012 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/07/who-are-americas-best-paid-general-counsel-2012-rankings/). Before Philip Morris, he enjoyed a thirty-year career at Kirkland & Ellis.

Sources have [previously praised](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/08/musical-chairs-david-bernick-departs-from-boies-schiller/) Bernick to us as “a great trial lawyer” who achieves “great results for his clients.” But perhaps he had special appeal to Paul Weiss besides his courtroom skills, as Alison Frankel suggested on Twitter:

David Bernick, ex of Dechert, Boies Schiller and Kirkland, is moving to Paul Weiss, which lost products expertise when Beth Wilkinson left

— Alison Frankel (@AlisonFrankel) [May 3, 2016](https://twitter.com/AlisonFrankel/status/727498607553695745)

Scott Flaherty also pointed this out in the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202756690895/Paul-Weiss-Hires-HighProfile-Product-Liability-Litigator):

Earlier this year, Paul Weiss also experienced a notable departure, as top litigator Beth Wilkinson—who spent part of her time at the firm defending Philip Morris USA Inc. in consumer class actions and pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. in product liability litigation—and fellow partner Alexandra Walsh [left the firm](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202747647134) to [start their own litigation shop](http://wilkinsonwalsh.com/).

But Paul Weiss chair Brad Karp told Am Law that Bernick’s hiring was not related to Wilkinson’s departure. “We’re in the talent business, and David is a world-class talent,” said Karp.

Congratulations to David Bernick and to Paul, Weiss on their match. Bernick is 61; PW has a [mandatory retirement age of 70](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202475527314/Age-Against-the-Machine-BigLaw-Firms-Cling-to-Mandatory-Retirement?slreturn=20160404124110). Will this be his final professional home before he exits the courtroom for good? Time will tell.

# Layoffs, Next-Gen Bar Exams, More Mass Shootings: The New Normal
## It's a new year, with new tragedies already here.

Those of us who lived through the Great Recession of 2007-2009 clearly remember the layoffs that tore through the legal profession — a tornado that destroyed everything in its path. That layoff tornado may be coming around again, given the mass layoffs at Meta (Facebook), Alphabet (Google), Amazon, and, of course, Twitter. How do you decide who stays and who gets riffed? What factors should be used, being mindful of all the claims of various sorts of discrimination that can be raised? ATL [reports on the layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/) which, so far, have not been huge. Note my qualifying language.

How about deciding based on an algorithm? Remember HAL from the Stanley Kubrick movie, “[2001: A Space Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film))“? (If you have never seen it, do so, even though it was made almost 60 years ag0.) HAL’s grandson may be determining who stays and who gets whacked. Almost 100% of HR leaders say that [algorithms will play a part](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/01/23/layoffs-2023-recession-software-programs/11086842002/) in those determinations, to a greater or lesser degree.

While algorithms are helpful in jobs that have metrics (e.g., sales goals, call centers, and those kind of numbers-based jobs), lawyers don’t have those same kinds of metrics, or should they? And while we may boast about a win-loss record, just like in sports, many factors go into whether you win or lose, and (sorry to say) it may not be just your reputation as a hotshot trial lawyer, but also performance reviews, if they exist, comments from clients, ability to get and retain business (now there may be a “sales” or “retention” algorithm in that last one). But would you want to trust your career future to an algorithm? Not me.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
All hail the forthcoming revision to the bar exam, dubbed the “Next Gen” bar exam, at least in [those states that use the Uniform Bar Exam](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/old-bar-exam-or-new-one-states-will-have-choice-2026-2023-01-19/) (as usual, California is different and doesn’t use it, at least not yet). The new and hopefully “improved” UBE [will debut in 2026](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/all-systems-go-for-the-nextgen-bar-exam-but-dont-expect-every-state-to-get-on-board-right-away/). States will have the option to use the new UBE right out of the gate or stay with the old one for a time. (Again, not in California, at least not so far, but we are more than three years away from implementation and as we all know a lot can change in three years.)

Bye-bye to questions on family law, trusts and estates, the UCC, and conflicts of law. The exam will also be shorter, only one and a half days, as opposed to two. Many have been clamoring for testing skills and not just rote memory, although that won’t completely disappear. In other words, “soft skills” will be tested, not just whether an examinee can spot an issue such as the Rule of Perpetuities, recite the rule, and apply it to the question. Less doctrinal law on the exam, and more real-life issues. Examinees could still be tested on real property and so the Rule of “Purple Tooties,” as we used to call it, may still lurk. I still have that rule rattling around in my head; it’s a song that just won’t quit my brain.

What skills will be tested? Client counseling and advising, client relationships and management, legal research, legal writing, and negotiations. How do you evaluate these “soft skills” for purposes of passing the bar? Criteria to be used? We will have to wait and see. At least [female bar examinees](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/university-texas-law-school-sexist-ranking/) won’t be rated on their attractiveness, so far as we know.

Those who have ever Googled me know that I am in Pasadena, California, just a few miles north of Monterey Park, where yet another mass shooting took place over the Lunar New Year weekend. I am even closer to Alhambra, where a brave soul prevented more carnage by wrestling a gun away from the 72-year-old shooter who later died by suicide as law enforcement closed in on a van where he sat in the driver’s seat. The bad news? We will only be able to surmise what his motive(s) might have been. The good news? One less need to use precious judicial resources to prosecute him. Eleven dead in Monterey Park.

And that’s not all. About 350 miles to the north, in Half Moon Bay, right along the coast, seven people died, and the suspect has made his first court appearance. I could spend my whole word count listing the places and the number of the dead and injured just within the past few months, but I will let [the Gun Violence Archive website](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) do it for me.

As I have written time and again, screw thoughts and prayers. Just in the past year, from Buffalo to Uvalde to Highland Park to Monterey Park and all the places in between where gun violence has struck again and again, when are we going to have the gumption to truly do something about this? I am sick and tired of being sick and tired about calls to enact legislation for stronger gun control. They are empty words and promises.

Monterey Park, Half Moon Bay, and all the others are just more mass shootings, only different to the families and friends of the fallen and to the survivors. Have we become so inured to the violence that we just mouth the perfunctory platitudes that seem to be standard operating procedure today? [This ATL column was eerily prophetic](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/the-next-gun-massacre-is-coming/) back in 2017.

The next gun massacres are already here. It’s now business as usual.

Money, money, money! That’s the big news in Biglaw, as the raises started by Milbank and upped by Cravath are making their way through the industry. But at Cahill Gordon & Reindel — a firm that made $415,200,000 in gross revenue last year — matching the market is only the start.

In addition to the generous market raises and year-end bonuses making the rounds, Cahill has come over the top. They’re also offering special bonuses to associates.

The new compensation matrix at the firm is as follows:



Beating the market by offering [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-cahill-gordon-beats-the-market-once-again/) on [top](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/12/associate-bonus-watch-cahill-gordons-never-ending-bonus-bounty/) of the year-end bonuses is [something](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/12/associate-bonus-watch-its-cahill-time-aka-time-for-cravath-associates-to-feel-bad-again/) of a Cahill [calling card](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/biglaw-firm-beats-cravath-scale-with-special-bonuses/). [They’ve](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/biglaw-firm-announces-market-bonuses-plus-special-end-of-the-year-bonuses/)[ been ](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/cahill-bonus-2021/)at it for [years](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/associate-bonus-watch-cahill-gordon-tops-market-with-special-bonuses/). It’s nice to see the new raises haven’t stopped the tradition.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Biglaw Firms Remain Mum On COVID-19 Vaccination Policies
## Thus far, only one firm has mandated vaccination in order for employees to return to the office.

As the coronavirus crisis rages on across America, with deaths having reached more than 503,000 as of the time of this writing, Biglaw firms still seem to be employing a [wait-and-see strategy](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/will-biglaw-firms-require-lawyers-and-staff-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine/) when it comes to the vaccination of their workforces. According to CDC guidance, lawyers and legal professionals will be in the next vaccine distribution group, so law firms are quickly losing time to make decisions on their vaccine policies.

Thus far, only one Biglaw firm has stepped forward with a definitive course of action. At the end of January, Davis Wright Tremaine was the first Biglaw firm to [announce a formal COVID-19 vaccination plan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-announce-a-covid-19-vaccination-plan/). While the firm is encouraging all employees who are eligible to be vaccinated to do so as soon as possible, only those who have been fully vaccinated will be allowed to enter the office or to attend firm-sponsored events. In the future, DWT will require proof of vaccination, and lawyers and staff members who are unable to be vaccinated due to a disability, advice of a medical provider, or religious beliefs will be able to explore reasonable accommodations with the firm.

With the month of February now almost over, other firms are now coming foward to announce their “likely” vaccination plans, if they have any plans at all — that is, the firms are not likely to mandate vaccination for employees to be able to return to their offices. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/02/24/for-now-few-firms-are-committing-to-mandatory-covid-vaccination-405-77639) has the details:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Few Am Law 200 firms are mandating that their attorneys and staff get COVID-19 vaccines as the legal industry gears up for an expected return to the office by the second half of the year.

Fish & Richardson, McGuireWoods, Stoel Rives and Shook, Hardy & Bacon have said they will likely not require proof of vaccination as a condition to returning to their offices. Firms such as Proskauer Rose and Debevoise & Plimpton have yet to decide.

What’s the hold up here? Perhaps it’s just “too soon.” Mimi Moore, a labor and employment partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, thinks it may be a tad early for law firms to say that they’re in favor of mandatory vaccination, especially given the vaccine shortages in some areas of the country.

In the meantime, some firms like Stoel Rives are offering paid time off as a way to encourage employees to get vaccinated, while others like McGuireWoods will be tracking vaccinations in order to set up certain thresholds for a return to the office.

Which firm will be next to announce its vaccination policy? This is a matter of employee health and wellness that’s far too impotant for Biglaw firms to remain silent on for much longer. The Biglaw world is impatiently watching and waiting.

Ed. note: To help launch our new “LMA on ATL” channel, we’ll be bringing you daily updates from the annual Legal Marketing Association conference this week. The event runs through Friday in San Diego. 

It’s the first full day of the Legal Marketing Association Annual Conference, and true to the event theme, we’re ready to go “All In” on two days of education, inspiration, and networking.

The largest global meeting exclusively for the legal marketing profession has drawn 1,200 attendees, including about 400 new members; this is the largest crowd for LMA so far. For the next two days, the conference will provide essential- and advanced-level programming spanning all six areas of the LMA’s Body of Knowledge: business development, business of law, client services, communications, marketing management and leadership, and technology management.

Advice for All:

- Download the app – “LMA Annual Conference 2024” on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. From there, you can organize your agenda, connect with other attendees, and collect contact information.
- If you feel torn between two sessions, don’t fret: Attendees will receive access to the Recordings Bundle for breakout session recordings.
- Focus your networking time: During lunch, join a table for a Shared Interest Group (SIG) that matters to you. (You do not need to be a member to join.) On Thursday, there will be dedicated real estate for the Business to Consumer SIG, the Competitive Intelligence SIG, the Social and Digital Media SIG, the CMO SIG, and the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion SIG.

It’s all in how you define a “win.” As a former AGC, there are [numerous ways to win in-house](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/defining-wins-in-house/). Yes, in-house counsel can help the client win money, keep the client from losing money, manage or avert crises, and, of course, satisfy the client, if their expectations are reasonable. Their job was to bring the money in the front door, and my job was to keep it from going out the back door in terms of verdicts and shudderingly expensive settlements.

But there are other wins as well. One is when you develop client relationships so that clients trust your advice and are willing to accept it. That takes time, but the rewards are worth the effort. If a client trusts you and your advice, then it becomes easier to persuade clients to take some steps, refrain from others, and manage their expectations.

What’s another win? The responsibility that in-house counsel has at the outset may take years for an associate at an outside law firm to shoulder. In-house counsel must hit the ground running, as there is little time, if any, for education. It is the essence of on-the-job training. The client assumes a certain amount of subject matter expertise, but the necessary and important people skills need polishing. That’s to be expected, as you don’t know who the players are, don’t know who makes the decisions (do you have any settlement authority?), and don’t know the various and sundry client politics. Those can take a while to learn, so the best way to approach this all is to watch and listen, listen very carefully. You will have plenty of opportunities to speak up.

And for all those out-house lawyers who think that in-house counsel have it comparatively easy, it’s time to get a grip. According to a recent Bloomberg Law report, [in-house counsel outwork](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-in-house-counsel-say-they-work-more-than-firm-lawyers) (not necessarily something to crow about) their outside counterparts.

While today there are more women lawyers than ever before, in practice, in government, and on the bench, before there was Ketanji Brown Jackson, before Amy Coney Barrett, before Elena Kagan, before Sonia Sotomayor, before Ruth Bader Ginsberg, there was the first, Sandra Day O’Connor. And to her credit, she has not been the last. Whether you believe that her judicial philosophy was too liberal or too conservative (you choose), she was and will always be the first, as so aptly titled in [Evan Thomas’s book](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/first-syndrome-sandra-day-oconnor-and-progress-for-women/) about her. As the number of women in law continues to increase, albeit still too slowly, today’s women lawyers and judges owe a huge debt to the late Associate Justice O’Connor.

Way back in medieval times (circa 1980), Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan kept a campaign promise: he would nominate a woman to join the all-male cohort of justices on the Supreme Court. In 1981, he nominated O’Connor to that court. In what is now looked upon longingly as the lost and last days of bipartisanship, she was confirmed by a vote of 98-0.

Young women lawyers, like me, were thrilled and delighted at O’Connor’s confirmation. It was, to many of us, a sign that the glass ceiling for women as lawyers and equals would be shattered. We were hopeful, starry-eyed, and thought that the road ahead for women lawyers would be smoother than it had been in the past. Maybe. The struggle continues more than 40 years after her confirmation.

Unlike her Supreme Court colleagues, O’Connor had been an Arizona politician before going on that state’s bench. She was a pragmatist, never choosing to go further than she needed in order to reach what she thought was the right result in the case. She did not think that “compromise” was an ugly word. She knew well what compromise meant in those days, but that’s no longer the case. Compromise today is a dirty word.

Resigning from the court to take care of her ailing husband (aren’t women almost always the caretakers?), she went on to create [icivics.org](https://www.icivics.org/) to teach civics to secondary students. Civics? What is that? Precisely her point.

One of the many things I found fascinating about O’Connor was her seemingly effortless ability to juggle so many plates in the air at the same time. She was as committed to her husband and family as she was to being an associate justice with a killer workload. I always wondered how she did it, especially when she was diagnosed with breast cancer before the end of her first decade on the court. But she managed it. How did she accomplish all that she did when she had the same 24-hour day just like the rest of us?

While O’Connor might scoff at this characterization, she was an [agent of change](https://empiricalscotus.com/2023/12/04/oconnor-and-the-court/) in so many ways. And thank goodness she was.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Beyond Biglaw: 3 Reasons Law Firms Are Not Safe Spaces
## Law firms, particularly those that do sophisticated work on behalf of corporate clients, will be bastions of refusal to indulge the desire of millennials for “protection” from the harsh glare of reality.

One of the criticisms of millennials, especially those on the campuses of colleges and universities today, is that they are too sensitive. Stories abound of colleges needing to respond to the needs of the millennial student body, whether by fostering “safe spaces,” avoiding microaggressions (by speakers, faculty, or students themselves), or being cognizant of both verbal and nonverbal “triggers” that cause angst — or worse. Having graduated college almost twenty years ago, I find some of these alleged sensitivities in today’s students a bit overblown. More importantly, campuses that encourage this level of sensitivity are arguably failing in their primary mission — to educate and prepare the next generation for their participation as productive citizens. The whole tempest suggests that in at least some cases the inmates are running the asylum.

Every so often, there is a story in the mass media about this phenomenon. Depending on the perspective of the author, the particular incident or position being discussed is hailed as an example of how society is finally responding to longstanding injustice, or (more often) an example of how self-absorbed today’s youth are. In the latter case, there is usually bemoaning of the loss in them of some American ideal, such as self-sufficiency, grit, or the ability to respect the opinions of others. No matter what your particular position is on the matter, there is a creeping suggestion that this is just the start of a movement of sorts, and that broader society will need to form a response — especially to those who are most militant about making sure that they feel protected and secure at all times. Because eventually these people will leave the cocoon of college, and begin to make their demands in the workplace.

Personally, I hope this hyper-focused and misguided attention on meeting the needs of young people — at the risk of indulging their most narcissistic and intolerant tendencies — passes. At least before my children make it to college, or until my law firm is confronted with the opportunity to hire someone forged by the current collegiate experience. I am confident in one thing, at least: law firms, particularly those that do sophisticated work on behalf of corporate clients, will be bastions of refusal to indulge the desire of millennials for “protection” from the harsh glare of reality.  Nor will they absolve even their youngest lawyers from the challenging demands of a professional career in the service of others.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
There are at least three reasons why law firms will never be safe spaces, even for talented youth. First off, the entire premise underlying the movement to protect millennials runs counter to the noble aspirations that are supposed to undergird the values of a law firm. The idea that someone is so special that their particular idiosyncrasies (especially about what they find unpleasant) deserve respect is silly thinking — especially when the main thing law firms care about is performance. Law firms are founded, and maintained, on the idea of serving others, and uniformly promise that they will set the needs of the client over those of the firm or its lawyers. When the ideal is to serve the client to the best of the firm’s ability, demanding, even for a second, that the firm worry about the feelings of a particular young lawyer represents a degree of selfishness that will not play well. The overwhelming majority of law firms do an admirable job of rooting out, as best as they can, abusive behavior directed at their lawyers. But anyone expecting that a law firm will embrace a culture of protecting their lawyers from microaggressions is dreaming.

Second, law firms demand that their lawyers exercise judgment, even when in uncomfortable surroundings or situations. Millennials, or those of any other age group, who walk around feeling butthurt at any slight or negativity will simply not survive in a law firm setting. Besides improperly focusing attention on themselves, lawyers who demonstrate too much sensitivity are also showing that they lack judgment. The practice of law demands that a lawyer be able to filter out irrelevant information, and focus on putting the client in the strongest possible position for success. Imagine what would happen if a lawyer defending a client at deposition got thrown off by a snide comment from opposing counsel, or felt disadvantaged for having to sit with their back to the window. Legal practice demands a thick skin, and the judgment to make the most of even uncomfortable situations. Law firms embrace that challenge, rather than indulge those who would rather avoid it.

The third reason that overly sensitive millennials would fail in a law firm environment is because of the adversarial ethos that pervades law firm life. It is a competitive environment, starting from the minute you sit at your desk for the first time. If you are an associate, you are competing with your colleagues for the attention of partners (and the billable hours they bestow), or when times are rough, for the chance to keep your job. As you get more senior, the stakes escalate, and your need to compete with both colleagues and external adversaries increases. Even dealings with clients can turn adversarial at times, and while there are bounds to the give-and-take, the system is designed to reward those who can think clearly even in times of stress. Or in the face of personal attacks, at least on one’s competence or negotiating position.

None of this is to suggest that millennials can’t be trained and turned into good lawyers. They can and will be, once they come to recognize that law firms will not be as indulgent as their schools may have been. At the same time, young people hoping for a career in a law firm (or similarly charged legal workplace) need to be honest with themselves as to whether they have the fortitude to excel in such an environment. From what I have seen to date, the most outspoken of the advocates for the millennial cause on campus are doing a good job of suggesting that they won’t be able to perform in a law firm. Despite these indications of incompatibility, however, firms of all sizes will need to figure out a way to draw in millennial talent over the coming years, and channel that talent towards productive ends.

Scott Peeler

“We just assume that it happens / But no one else is in the room where it happens.” — [Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://genius.com/11705766)

This month, [Arent Fox](https://www.arentfox.com/) announced its inaugural Fellows Program class — an initiative for senior associates and junior partners that emphasizes personal and professional growth through a three-year leadership training program.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

The Fellows Program will focus on helping associates and young partners foster effective leadership skills and forge lasting relationships outside of their practice groups and offices. Lawyers selected for the program will attend retreats, participate in seminars, identify key issues at the firm, and develop strategies for addressing those issues.

Law partners don’t always make good leaders. But leaders usually make good law partners. This being said, lawyers don’t need to become partners to be leaders at their respective law firms. Leadership guru John Maxwell might’ve expressed this idea best when [he wrote](http://www.success.com/article/john-maxwell-lead-from-where-you-are):

If I had to identify the No. 1 misconception people have about leadership, it would be the belief that leadership comes from having a position or title. This position myth, that you can’t lead if you’re not at the top, couldn’t be further than the truth. The erroneous thinking of this myth is that leadership is position, not influence.

When potential leaders understand the dynamics of gaining influence with people, they come to realize that position has little to do with genuine leadership. You can lead others from anywhere in the organization, and when you do, you make the organization better. The bottom line is this: Leadership is a choice you make, not a place you sit. Anyone can choose to become a leader wherever he or she is. You can make a difference no matter where you are.

This week, I had the opportunity to catch up with [Scott Peeler](https://www.arentfox.com/people/m-scott-peeler), the Arent Fox New York litigation partner who is spearheading this program. He is an ardent subscriber to the notion of [leading from where you are](http://www.success.com/article/john-maxwell-lead-from-where-you-are). From our discussion, it became apparent just how passionate Peeler is about promoting leadership, diversity, and inclusion in our profession. Without further ado, here are some excerpts from our conversation:

RC: Why were you attracted to a career in law, and how did you choose University of North Carolina School of Law?

SP: I chose Carolina Law because it’s a great public institution, and by working my way through law school, I was able to graduate debt-free. This allowed me to accept my dream job, working as an Assistant District Attorney for the legendary Robert Morgenthau.

In that office, everything was about doing justice, and there isn’t a day that goes by where a lesson or experience from that job that began 20 years ago this month doesn’t inform and inspire me.

RC: What would you put on a billboard outside of a law school and why?

SP: “Don’t Be Afraid To Look Foolish.” The legal community is filled with brilliant legal minds who are desperately frightened of looking foolish in front of others. And that fear is one of the single greatest impediments to innovation and creativity in our profession.

Change in law firms often comes too slowly, but if more voices are empowered to share new ideas and different ways of thinking, that won’t always be the case. And one thing is for certain: you can’t feel empowered if you are afraid.

RC: Arent Fox has developed the Fellows Program based on three foundational ideas: (1) partnership and leadership are not the same thing, (2) leadership can be taught; and (3) leadership matters. Can you expound on these first principles?

SP: First, we believe that while a partner can certainly be a great leader, there is no automatic correlation between the two concepts. It is also true that associates and other industry professionals can be great leaders too, and everyone must be given the opportunity to share ideas and solutions to problems as they arise.

Second, it is a dangerous misperception that leadership is innate. This view permits inherent biases to exist and creates an unhealthy “chosen few” perspective that has no place in our firm. Leadership can and should be studied, as it results in personal insights, better group dynamics, and professional and organizational growth.

And finally, leadership matters. It’s where cultures are won or lost; morale rises or falls; and vision is gained or sacrificed. Leadership is not unique to those elected or appointed to a titled position – everyone can and should make a difference.

RC: You mentioned that corporate America, our clients, historically have done a much better job at promoting leadership than law firms. Why do you believe the legal profession has been out of touch with this issue?

SP: I think you can often draw a straight line between power at most law firms and the partners who originate the most business. There is, of course, no guarantee that the individual with the biggest book of business is the best person to articulate a vision for the firm, let alone motivate and lead positive growth and change.

And this reality, in my opinion, has been a major impediment to the active and meaningful study of leadership at many law firms. Luckily, at Arent Fox, our culture is unique and is focused on empowering many rather than protecting the ego of the few.

RC: One of the goals of the Arent Fox Fellows Program is to include and empower different voices. This entails challenging its participants to ask, “what voices are missing from the discussion?” Why is it important for a firm to develop an action plan for diversity and inclusion?

SP: One of the most important functions of a leader is to include and empower different voices. Whether we’re setting an internal vision for our firm’s future or coming up with a practical, real-world solution for a client, we believe the dialogue must include voices that reflect as many different experiences and viewpoints as possible.

Our reasons for an action plan are simple: we want to make sure the best ideas can rise to the top. We want our talented professionals to be given every opportunity to lead and to know that their voices are important and will be heard. And we want to make sure our culture is one centered on inclusion.

RC: Why did you decide to spearhead this initiative?

SP: One of the common experiences many of us had at Arent Fox was feeling that our opinions and thoughts mattered from the very beginning of our careers.

At our firm, it’s never been about a title or position, but rather the strength of an idea and one’s conviction. That propelled many of us forward, and we are spearheading this initiative to ensure that future generations will be empowered to know they can and should make a difference and given the skills and knowledge to do so effectively.

RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

SP: Thank you, Renwei. We think the Fellows Program is novel within our industry for its holistic approach. We didn’t create a program that focuses on one or two particular aspects of leadership.

Instead, we designed this to be a three-year program that will help our inaugural class, and those that follow, grow individually, build camaraderie, and protect one of Arent Fox’s greatest assets — its culture.

# 'Happy' Salary News Sours: First-Year Match Coming, But No Raises Until January

For all we know, this might be all the senior associates are getting.

After making its associates wait forever to hear the details of its new compensation regime, BakerHostetler decided… to make them wait even longer. We’d heard that the firm was committed to matching for first-years and otherwise punted until a July 15 meeting. With July 15 in the rearview mirror, BakerHostetler told its associates that they would be seeing more money, but declined to get very specific:

BakerHostetler will match Cravath scale for first years and raise everyone else’s salaries based on “merit” and PwC survey of similarly situated firms. Raises and letters notifying salaries of any increase in base compensation won’t be revealed until mid December and take effect 1/17. No memo.

So we have a major firm not handing out raises until January, not even telling lawyers until December, and ducking behind a questionable “black box” system. That’s three strikes in this league. If you begin from the premise that one of the most important functions of salary is to recruit quality talent, hiding the ball until after OCI is a fair sign that these letters aren’t going to be bringing much good cheer. More likely, senior associates will be squeezed while the firm trumpets “matching” for first-years.

But putting aside the substance of these “raises,” the style of the announcement itself bears unpacking. In the New York office, it was presented as a “good news” meeting for all associates. And then…

The “good news” was that people studying for the bar exam will make 180k in NY (unclear what other offices) effective Jan 1. How that impacted anyone in the room is beyond me, but there was dead awkward silence when the room was opened up for a Q&A.

“Hey everyone, we just wanted you to know a bunch of people you don’t know are making more money. So, you might be making more money someday, too. Frankly we haven’t decided yet. Any questions before we pop the bubbly?”

One associate didn’t appreciate the party:

If you could put out the word so we can have some kind of Amazon Prime day for recruiters, here it’d be great.

Indeed.

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

People like things they can count.

So those things become important.

Imagine, if you will, two people who write online columns. The first columnist is good. He (or she) has quality working in his (or her) favor. This columnist is smart, regularly says intelligent stuff (thus distinguishing himself from, say, yours truly), writes with flair, and generally improves the state of human knowledge.

The second columnist is bad. He (or she) has nothing to say and takes too many words not to say it. But the second columnist has no shame and attaches enticing headlines to his (or her) dreck: “Pictures of actresses that you just won’t believe!” “The three simple tricks that reduce stomach fat!” “Four lies guaranteed to make you a millionaire!” “Five amazing tricks to improve your sex life!”

Who will the world value?

The second columnist, of course.

You can’t (easily) rate quality. But you can (easily) count the number of people who click through to look at an article. (Okay, okay: You can also look at how long a visitor spends reading a web page. If people average five minutes reading columnist one’s stuff and five seconds reading columnist two’s, maybe you could tell something from that. But bear with me.)

Because you can count the number of clicks, but you can’t count the quality of the product, people — employers, advertisers, those who matter — will pay more for the poorer quality, but more easily quantified, product.

Why is that like billable hours?

Hypothesize lawyer one, who produces great work. Really great: Innovative arguments, interesting writing, far more likely to convince a judge to rule in your favor.

Hypothesize lawyer two, who bills a lot of hours. This person doesn’t produce anything particularly great, but it sure takes the person a long time to do it.

Who does the firm value?

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
You can’t count quality. But you can (and firms do) count billable hours. So that’s what firms value.

Presto! That’s why billable hours are like clickbait.

You can tell me that I’m wrong, and that over time quality will out.

Perhaps.

But not quickly.

The person who writes bad columns (or briefs) will insist that the bad columns (or briefs) are good, and most observers won’t take the time (or have the capacity) to tell the difference. Except for observers who are particularly attentive and concerned, distinctions in quality vanish.

Even if, over time, you can observe the effects of quality, that’s unlikely to make a difference. Maybe a great lawyer will win a few more cases over the course of a decade. Maybe clients will care.

But maybe not. Maybe the great lawyer is asked to defend harder cases. He (or she) wins the same percentage as the bad lawyer. That’s a spectacular track record, but who cares? The lawyer’s greatness is showing through, but not in a way that anyone can discern.

I’ve heard several people recently bemoan that, “My firm used to appreciate great lawyers. Now it appreciates only lawyers who bill a lot of hours or attract a lot of business. Quality is virtually irrelevant.”

I feel sorry for those folks. But what’s the world to do?

It’s the siren song of numbers.

We like things that we can count, and quality is not one of those things.

# The Scourge Of Constant Monitoring Is (Partially) Gone At Latham
## You really do need time away from Biglaw.

For years, the concept of face time was huge in Biglaw (even at firms that claimed a more balanced approach to work and personal life). It communicated your constant availability and commitment to the firm. As technology has improved, and you know, a global pandemic forced attorneys all to work from home, the ubiquitous green status light — on whatever messaging program your firm uses — became a proxy for the go-getter spirit.

But that’s taken a toll on associates. Over a year into that working-from-home life and we know attorneys are more stressed than ever, and with no physical separation between home and the office, there’s increased pressure to always be “on” and ready to work at a moment’s notice.

Mega Biglaw firm Latham & Watkins saw this pressure cooker and has decided to do something about it. The firm recently told associates that, outside of regular business hours (9 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time) the default status would automatically be switched to “away.” It’s an effort designed to break the 24/7 mindset and give folks explicit permission to actually carve out some time away from work.

For the 17th year in a row, [Yale Law Women](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/yale-law-women/) issued its Top Firms report. This undertaking is designed to “monitor trends in overall equity among law firms ranked in the Vault 100, raise awareness of disparities within the legal profession, highlight progress being made in the industry, and identify areas for improvement.”

Rather that just spit out a Top 10 list, YLW splits the recognition up into specific categories:

Our report continues last year’s methodology of recognizing firm accomplishments through a series of “Category Honors” rather than one holistic Top Ten list. We recognize that attorneys have individualized experiences and distinct needs, and we hope our methodology will help law students and new attorneys identify firms that best suit their needs and priorities.

So, without further ado, here are the 2022 Top Law Firms:

# Law Firm Leaders Think It's About Time To Completely Freak Out

The U.S. economy brought to you by Thanos of Titan.

Kent Brockman: Professor, without knowing precisely what the danger is, would you say it’s time for our viewers to crack each other’s heads open and feast on the goo inside?
Professor: Yes I would, Kent.

In the above passage from The Simpsons, feel free to replace beloved Channel 6 anchor Kent Brockman with “Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group” and the professor with “the leaders of the major law firms.” It’s that time of year for Citi Private Bank to release the results of its law firm management confidence survey. Last year, like most years, [confidence levels were thoroughly middling](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/law-firm-leaders-are-completely-confident-that-they-dont-have-much-confidence/), with management fairly confident that the economy would putter meekly forward. Lawyers aren’t known for unbridled optimism, but this year’s results, even judging on an attorney’s curve, are a lot more gloomy.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
From the executive summary of the Law Firm Confidence Index, we see that “confidence in the US economy dipped significantly below neutral, while projections for global economic growth continued to dip even further.” Law firms continue to see demand improvements, though expectations were moderated. But law firm demand usually enjoys a slight uptick when the bottom falls out of the economy so that’s not exactly encouraging.

They are also less optimistic that pricing pressure will abate and expect a deceleration in revenue and net income growth. Despite a more modest outlook for the first half of 2020, law firm leaders plan to accelerate headcount growth.

Revenue down… headcount up. At least until the mad dash to cover bankruptcies and emergency mergers starts to die down and the firm is left to consider exactly how many of these heads they want to keep counting every day. There could be some bumpy times ahead folks.

# O'Melveny Gets In On The Associate Raise Action
## Another firm matches the Biglaw salary increases.

Woohoo! These associate raises are truly coming fast and furious! It sure feels like everyone — well, at least those at the top of the Biglaw heap — is anxious to let associates know just how much they’re appreciated. …And hopefully keep those valuable associates right where they are and off of the hot lateral market.

The latest firm to up the payday for associates is none other than O’Melveny & Myers. The firm took home $835,097,000 in gross revenue in 2020 has decided to join its peers in sharing that wealth with associates. In a firmwide voicemail, it was announced associate compensation will move to the scale set by Davis Polk last week. New salaries, effective July 1, will range from $205,000 for the class of 2020 to $365,000 for the class of 2013+.

# Elite Firm Sets 2022 Office Return Date Due To Delta Variant
## Yet another firm has decided to forgo a full reopening in 2021.

After thousands upon thousands of lawyers and staff were forced from their offices in 2020 due to the pandemic, the final quarter of 2021 was supposed to be Biglaw’s big comeback. Unfortunately, those carefully strategized return-to-office plans were no match for COVID’s Delta variant. Law firms across the country now seem to realize that the coronavirus crisis is far from over, and that reopening their offices en masse may be ill advised.

While some firms are holding out hope for a 2021 return (and quite a few have honored their original reopening dates), others are putting the kibosh on returning this year at all. Which firm is the latest to announce a 2022 reopening?

That would be Clifford Chance. The firm had planned to [return to an office-based working environment](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/elite-firm-will-require-vaccination-but-other-reopening-policies-are-very-flexible/) starting on September 13, with up to two remote days each week for both attorneys and business professionals. All employees were required to be vaccinated by that date as well. The firm then [delayed its plans](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/skadden-mandates-vaccines-for-all-sidley-remains-mum-on-vaccination-but-pushes-back-reopening-date/) due to the super-infectious Delta variant, and a full reopening was to occur sometime during the week of October 25. Like all plans during COVID times, that changed quickly.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Yesterday afternoon, this brief note was sent to all personnel working in Clifford Chance’s Americas offices (emphasis added):

The Americas Management Committee met to discuss our planned return to office-based working the week of October 25th. We carefully considered the situations in NY, São Paulo and Washington, DC and decided to defer our return to formal office-based working, setting a target return date for the week of January 10th. If that date changes (including an earlier date should things improve in a meaningful way), we will provide you with at least 30 days’ notice. Our number one priority is your health and well-being and we will continue to evaluate our return plans as new information becomes available.

Our region’s offices continue to be open on a voluntary basis with an increasing number of colleagues coming in each week.

Clifford Chance likes to keep things short and sweet, and the firm’s focus continues to be on the health and safety of its employees, from lawyers to staff members.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

# Why We Always Think We're Winning At Trial

Fifty percent of lawyers in the world are worse than average. (Trust me; I did the math.)

I’ve seen lawyers who simply don’t know what a leading question is. Perry Mason always did well on cross; the culprit broke down and admitted that he did it. I’ve seen lawyers who seemingly think the opposing expert will break down and cry under a withering series of open-ended questions.

It’s pretty unlikely to happen, but bad lawyers generally don’t know that they’re bad.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
I watched a mock trial about a decade ago in which the local counsel we’d hired for our side played the other side at trial. This lawyer — whom we’d hired — had a fine reputation. Other lawyers in the community recommended him (or her). This lawyer was terrible. The lawyer had no idea what a theme of the case was and made no effort to present one. The lawyer didn’t know how to argue. And the lawyer had been practicing for a respectable period; this old dog presumably thought that he (or she) was good and wasn’t going to change his (or her) ways.

I was hired once to do an appeal in a product liability “failure to warn” case. I read the trial transcript. The trial lawyer for my side — who thought he was pretty good — had not put the warning label into evidence. You read that right: Did not offer the warning label in a failure to warn case.

(Someone told me about a recent study that asked, “Would you rather be rich or smart?” Apparently, smart people generally say that they’d rather be smart.  Stupid people say that they’d rather be rich. A friend of mine — a law school professor — commented, “Of course. If you’re poor, it’s easy to imagine being rich. If you’re stupid, it’s hard to imagine being smart.”)

The lawyers I’m writing about thought they were good. They weren’t, and it’s unlikely they’d ever understand that.

There are also good lawyers with little sense of self. I once watched a very smart lawyer do a cross-examination during a jury trial. To an observer, such as me, the cross-examination was a meaningless blood bath. The lawyer was angry, the witness was angry, the lawyer and witness refused to communicate and yelled at each other. To my eye, it played to an ugly draw.

The lawyer said to me afterward, “I made good progress with him, didn’t you think?”

I hadn’t really noticed. Maybe, when I got around to studying the transcript after trial, I would decide that the Q’s and A’s somehow helped. All I noticed was two frustrated guys yelling at each other.

That’s the first reason we always think we’re winning during a trial: There’s a natural tendency to overestimate yourself.

The second reason you think you’re winning at trial is a function of groupthink.

Suppose you have a terrible day at trial. Things couldn’t have gone worse.

Really, really bad.

At the beginning of dinner, everyone’s dejected.

But you can’t stay dejected forever. Someone orders a bottle of wine.  Someone else points out the one thing that went well during the day. The mood brightens. Talk continues. By the end of dinner, things hadn’t gone so badly after all. In fact, you probably did okay today.

People generally don’t focus on the glum side of things. They convince themselves that the trial is going pretty well. Things went okay on the bad days. And things went great on the days when you’re actually ahead by a little bit. After a week of this self-deception, you’re convinced that you’re going to win.

And then shocked when you don’t.

Be very, very careful of your perception of how things are going at your trial.

I know you think you’re going to win. But you’re overestimating yourself, and you’re being deceived by your colleagues. Things are probably not going as swimmingly as you believe.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

If I have somebody billing 1,500 hours and not coming in at least three times a week, am I doing them any favors by letting them do that?

Their career might be flashing before their eyes. It behooves us to say, ‘It’s better if you come into work, get into the rhythm, pick up some things around the office.’

— An anonymous Biglaw leader, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/18/fear-or-fomo-big-law-split-on-how-to-boost-office-attendance/), explaining that a firm may encourage more office attendance to try to assist associates who seem to be struggling with their billable hours while working remotely.

It especially matters during jury trials, where lingering on a point can be the difference between winning and losing.

But it also matters in bench trials. Judges are, after all, human. If you want them to remember something, linger on it.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

This is quick impeachment, and thus not very effective:

“You’ve since admitted what you said in your deposition was wrong. Is that correct?”

But this is long, slow, painful impeachment, which is far more effective:

“I know that you’ve since changed this testimony, but you originally said X at your deposition?”

“X was your best recollection at the time?”

“You knew you were under oath when you testified to X?”

“When you said X, you believed you were testifying truthfully and accurately?”

“You weren’t trying to deceive anyone?”

“But now you’ve decided that X was wrong?”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“In fact, X was wrong at the time that you swore under oath that it was true?”

Or some such thing.

Both of these lines of cross-examination make exactly the same point.

But one will stick in the listener’s memory: The leisurely cross-examination occupies more time; it develops more slowly; it reveals itself painfully and repeatedly (though always in different words, so as not to be redundant).

The same is true of any point that you want a jury to really understand.

Not:

“You crossed the street at 3 p.m.?”

If it matters:

“Let’s talk about February 15 at 3 p.m. February 15 was a sunny day?”

And several more questions, setting the stage, giving the background, and letting the jury stew in it.

Finally: “At 3 p.m. on February 15, you crossed the street?”

As another form of stress, if you want to emphasize a point, you can refer back to it repeatedly. Thus, here’s a bad cross-examination:

“What happened next?”

“What happened next?”

“Tell us what happened next.”

“Can you tell the jury what happened next?”

And here’s the same thing, stressing a point that matters:

“After you saw Jarndyce, did you walk across the bar toward him?”

“After you walked across the bar toward Jarndyce, did you pull out a knife?”

“After you walked across the bar and pulled out a knife, did Jarndyce ask the bartender for a drink?”

“After you walked across the bar and pulled out a knife, did the bartender pick up a bottle of bourbon?”

“After you walked across the bar and pulled out a knife, did the bartender pour Jarndyce a bourbon?”

“After you walked across the bar and pulled out a knife … ”

It’s all the same thing, but one version sticks in the jury’s memory, and the other does not.

Which means one examination is effective, and the other is not.

Which means one version could lead to victory at trial, while the other might not.

At trial, pace matters.

* Speaking of Robert Mueller, here’s a little preview of what you can expect from the court filings to be filed today which have to do with the implosion of Paul Manafort’s cooperation deal (i.e., “what may have pushed him to commit legal suicide”). Oh, and we may also see a possible sentencing plan for Michael Cohen. [[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/06/robert-mueller-friday-court-filings-paul-manafort-michael-cohen/2224334002/)]


* In case you missed it, Quinn Emanuel just announced its largest partner class ever. Fourteen attorneys will ascend to new heights at the firm, and half of them are women, which is very exciting. Congratulations to the firm! [[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/quinn-emanuels-2019-partner-class-is-largest-ever-half-women)]

* The holiday season is here, but that doesn’t give Biglaw associates an excuse to say “screw it” when it comes to what they’re eating.

Hint: Demand for legal services was even up compared to pre-pandemic (2019) demand, just not as by quite as large a margin.

These houses cost the same in two markets that moved to $180K. Still think you deserve the same salary?

UPDATE: A lot of people complained about this article. [Read the responses here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/answering-your-complaints-about-the-cost-of-living-post/).

UPDATE: For Dallas, [I’ve added a listing](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/2/) of a real-live associate trying to sell a house in the area.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Apparently, my efforts to [bring some sanity](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/) to the flattening of associate salaries across the country have fallen on mostly deaf ears. Again, I’m a big proponent of associate raises across the board to reflect what’s happened in Biglaw over the last decade — it’s just that not every single market should be making the same, and NY in particular is getting underpaid. But, good for all y’all — and given the location of some of the offices I’m talking about, that’s the right idiom.

However, maybe you all need a visual aid to drive home exactly how ridiculously good these associates in Dallas and Chicago have it. Or maybe you just need another reason to cry at your desk in New York City?

So I’ve gone through, with the help of Zillow, and compiled home listings that a recently enriched first-year associate can now buy in each market that raised salaries. We can call it “Lawyerly Lairs: Associate Raise Edition.”

In creating this list, I employed the following assumptions:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
1. Annual salary of $180K — no spousal or cosigning support.
2. Monthly debt of roughly $1,500/month — about average for a recent grad.
3. A small down payment of $20K — saved from your summer, natch. No old money help.
4. An average effective property tax rate of .8 percent.

The last is a little bit of a cheat. In San Francisco, an effective rate of .66 percent allows an associate, all else equal, to get upwards of $647K of home. Meanwhile, Boston’s 1.18 percent rate only yields about $603K of home. That can be a big difference. On the other hand, California associates are paying income taxes that Dallas associates aren’t so, for this survey, let’s just hold everyone to around .8 percent in taxes — which has the benefit of being the rate in several of the jurisdictions we’re looking at.

That nets a home of around $635K per the Zillow calculator, so let’s search for houses between $625K and $640K. For every listing, you can see more images at the links provided. You can also enlarge any photos herein by clicking on them and allowing the magic of the Internet to do the rest.

UPDATE (6/22/16 3:31 p.m.): As a tipster points out, I did not consider condo association fees. True. But in some ways this exacerbates the point since those mostly hit the big city markets (e.g. the Chicago apartment in this piece has upwards of $1000/month fees) and thus, if anything, the big city associates are even more screwed relative to their smaller market colleagues.

We’re going to look at NYC, [Chicago](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/8/), and [D.C.](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/10/), of course. But also [Dallas](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/2/), [Houston](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/3/), [L.A.](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/4/), [San Francisco and Palo Alto](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/5/), [Denver](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/6/), [Boston](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/9/), and [Charlotte](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/7/). This is a true tour of real estate around the nation.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Let’s begin with New York City, so the rest of the country can feel that pain.

Here’s a $629K place with [a whopping 530 square feet](http://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/2098262575_zpid/625000-640000_price/2226-2279_mp/14_days/size_sort/40.766827,-73.922625,40.698535,-74.075403_rect/12_zm/).

Note that this is the shot from the far window. You’re seeing the whole place. And this really is a lovely place in the Village. It’s also the size of someone’s tool shed in Dallas.

Here’s the kitchen, which has a door for some reason. You know, having a means of closing off ventilation with a gas stove is never a good idea. Was this the former home of celebrated author Sylvia Plath?

In case you’re wondering, this is the floorplan you buy for your $629,000.

Maybe you think you’re smarter than the average associate and you’ll live in Williamsburg with all the hipsters and get something bigger? Well, it may not be any bigger — it’s actually smaller, at 471 square feet — but it’s [a very nice place nonetheless](http://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/119572269_zpid/625000-640000_price/2226-2279_mp/6m_days/size_sort/40.727129,-73.906016,40.692971,-73.982406_rect/13_zm/).

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ISdo7a4xldpnav0000000000.jpg)

That’s a superb kitchen for a place like this. But did we mention the balcony yet?

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IS995vhosqi9zu0000000000.jpg)

Amazing. Yet let’s not lose sight of the 471 square feet issue:

For those outside New York, this is not an effort to find ridiculously tiny locales — these are actually very nice places for New York.

Or maybe you want to win this game by living in Jersey? Well, the joke’s on you because no one wins by living in Jersey.

Now let’s check out Dallas on the next page. It’s a little bit different….

Understanding the Importance of Lateral Hiring Interviews

Navigating the complex web of the legal profession often leads to lateral hiring interviews, a key component of legal career progression. As a managing partner of a prominent Houston law firm highlights, the lateral hiring market remains strong. Consequently, mastering these interviews is crucial for those looking to achieve notable advancement in their legal career. These interviews markedly differ from entry-level or on-campus interviews, requiring distinct preparation strategies to maximize success.

Prioritizing Practical Legal Expertise in Lateral Interviews

During these lateral hiring interviews, your practical legal expertise takes center stage. As one Houston law firm managing partner shares, “The deal sheet gets more attention from us than the resume.” However, there’s no need to fret over intricate legal questions as these are seldom asked. Instead, the focus shifts to your professional background, predominantly your legal resume and your past legal experiences, or case history. A thorough review of past cases and clearly articulating your unique role and contributions becomes a fundamental preparation step.

Crafting an Effective Deal Sheet for Lateral Interviews

Assembling a well-structured list of past cases, also known as a “deal sheet” in legal terminology, can significantly enhance your professional profile. Drawing insights from a corporate and securities partner from a renowned New York law firm, focus on three essential aspects when crafting this list: format, substance, and length.

- Format: Interviewers often favor case lists arranged by transaction type rather than chronological order. Use this preference to your advantage by placing your most notable legal cases at the top of each category.
- Substance: Replace generic terms such as “client” with more specific descriptions, as advised by legal professionals. Highlight aspects that align with the interviewing law firm’s key practice areas and elaborate on your role and contributions.
- Length: A comprehensive list that reflects the wide scope of your legal work is typically more appealing than a limited selection of cases.
Upholding Professionalism During Legal Interviews

Despite the evolving workplace norms and a casual attire trend, a formal approach is generally expected during law firm interviews. As one Houston-based law firm partner points out, “Most law firm hirers still expect professional attire because their clients still expect professional attire.”

Conducting Thorough Background Research

Performing background research about the potential law firm employer is another critical preparation step for lateral hiring interviews. Familiarize yourself with the firm’s unique strengths, its distinctive attributes, and the specifics of the department or group you’re interviewing with to leave a positive impression.

Harnessing Effective Communication Skills

Clear and concise articulation is a vital skill that interviewers assess during the hiring process. This skill is especially valued in law firms where associates are expected to interact with budget-conscious clients early in their careers, as per insights from a New York-based law firm partner.

Explaining Your Interest in the Firm

When asked about your interest in the firm, well-thought-out answers are appreciated. Possible reasons may include the desire to specialize in a domain not available at your current firm, the aspiration to diversify your client base, or positive feedback about the firm’s culture.

Evaluating the Prospective Law Firm

Lastly, remember that a lateral hiring interview also provides you with the opportunity to assess the law firm and its professionals. The prospect of mentorship, which is particularly important for junior attorneys, should be part of your evaluation. A partner from a Houston law firm points out that this doesn’t just mean a formal mentorship program, but also assessing whether the interviewers seem supportive of junior colleagues’ professional growth.

Choosing the Right Law Firm for You

Different law firms have unique selling propositions. A partner from a prominent Texas law firm suggests considering firms that emphasize their growth trajectory, entrepreneurial spirit, and dedication to nurturing junior attorneys. Others, as a partner from a renowned New York law firm highlights, may accentuate their unique culture, molded by their client base, and the opportunities available to associates. Recognizing these unique traits and the growth potential within such firms can aid in your lateral career progression in the legal profession.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Won't Make Lawyers Return To Office In 2021, But Vaccines Will Be Required
## In the future, the firm will be 'neither fully remote nor fully in person.'

While some Biglaw firms have mandated that associates and staff members return to the office on a regular, everyday basis, others have simply put an end to the five-day, in-office workweek, encouraging employees to come to the office a few times a week, with no pressure for facetime. But what if your firm let you know that you didn’t have to go back to the office for the rest of the year?

That’s exactly what’s happening over at Cooley. In a memo sent earlier this week by [Mark Pitchfield](https://www.cooley.com/people/mark-pitchford), the firm’s administrative and legal practice partner, he noted that thanks to the pandemic, the firm had “evolved to such a degree that our workplace of the future will be neither fully remote nor fully in person.” What does that mean for Cooley going forward? Here’s more from the memo:

Consistent with that evolution, for the balance of 2021 across our US offices, we will not institute a mandatory return date or require a minimum number of in-office days for those whose job duties permit remote work. For the remainder of this year, we welcome all whose personal circumstances and comfort levels permit to begin reacquainting yourselves with office life and with one another. With everyone’s health and well-being as our essential priority, and with the goal of making our workplaces as safe as reasonably possible, by Labor Day everyone working in or visiting one of our US offices must be fully vaccinated.

Cooley associates need not return to the office anytime this year, but the firm expects that anyone who plans to go back to the office be vaccinated. We’re noticing a trend here that more and more firms are expecting employees to be vaccinated before returning to the office. Will your firm be mandating the vaccine for all?

Getting back to Cooley’s “reopening” in name only…

We will remain a workplace for the future, characterized by trust, support and agility – a place that best suits our people, our clients and our culture. To those ends, we are committed to staying on the leading edge of creativity and flexibility while ensuring our ability to deliver world-class legal services. Given this, and the fact that we must remain vigilant about our health and well-being, now is not the time to delineate precisely what the post-pandemic work environment will look like. We will, of course, provide more information about 2022 closer to the end of this year.

Kudos to Cooley for recognizing that things are still up in the air when it comes to the pandemic, and for realizing that the firm should not let all the lessons learned during their time away from the office go to waste. We look forward to seeing what the firm’s hybrid office policy looks like in 2022.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Is Mandatory Retirement A Disaster Waiting to Happen?
## Relying on a mandatory retirement deadline hurts both the lawyer and the firm, especially if there is no succession plan in place.

Partners are invaluable contributors to law firms. Their experience and business generation are the pillars that support the behemoth of Biglaw, but concerns about mandatory retirement center around two key questions: How do we safeguard ourselves against the inevitable decline of acuity, and how do we ensure that junior partners don’t pile up on the ladder to business succession if partners postpone retirement?

For the former, a [plethora of research](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/194636) has shown that cognitive decline is slowed by mental stimulation, which law provides in spades. Pegging the retirement age to a national standard assumes uniform decline which may not be the case. That being said, the higher incidences of alcohol abuse and inadequate sleep among attorneys likely diminishes some of these gains.

For the latter, later retirements mean a logjam at the top of the business succession chain. Though the baby boomer generation opened up the ranks for a lot more partner positions, Biglaw could face a lost generation of partners who are being crowded out of clients by the late-retiring baby boomers.

Firms risk potentially alienating their junior attorneys by catering to the tried and proven. The long-term impact of such policies could be disastrous, which is why many firms are turning to succession plans to keep all parties happy.

Roughly half of Am Law 200 firms have some mandatory retirement policy. Not all stipulate retirement at 65 — most range roughly from 63-68, with different protocols as to how to deal with retiring attorneys. Some firms will transition partners into counsel positions where they can practice while transferring their clients and work to younger partners with longer runways, and others broach the topic of the impending retirement a year or two in advance to ease the partner’s transition out of the law firm.

Not all policies are made equal. Some firms advertise a mandatory retirement age but are willing to skirt it for rainmakers or make other “special exceptions.” That being said, many firms openly embrace lateral partners beyond the mandatory retirement age.




The drop-off in practicing attorneys from age 65 to age 70 is precipitous, especially compared to the U.S. overall population. One slightly confounding variable is the fact that 91.4 percent of partners over the age of 65 are male, who represent a lower percentage of the 65+ population.


Nonetheless, more and more workers are expecting to retire later, and the problem could only worsen with subsequent generations.



Over the last 20 years, the expected retirement age has risen by six years for non-retirees. Looking at the breakdown, by expected retirement age, the difference becomes even more stark.



From 1995 to 2018, the percentage of workers expecting to retire past the age of 65 has increased almost four-fold. Even in lucrative careers like law, partners are pushing back against hard and soft mandatory retirement policies, putting firms in an uncomfortable position.

Major Am Law 200 firms vary in their commitment to enforce mandatory retirement ages. Some firms take a strict approach to mandatory retirement, like Bradley Arant and Knobbe Martens, who have almost no attorneys over 65 years of age. On the other hand, Holland & Knight, Greenberg Traurig, Duane Morris, and K&L Gates tend to eschew the mandatory retirement requirement.

Promoting partners and associates to create a path to leadership positions, or rewarding them with lucrative client relationships, are efficient ways to seamlessly transfer responsibility to younger lawyers. At the same time, moving client relationships to younger partners also puts the firm at risk. Unless the firm feels the partner is loyal, or at least loyal enough, the firm may not want to transition the relationships too early in a partner’s career.

While the distribution of aging lawyers is trending upwards, firms may have to rethink their insistence on mandatory retirement and succession planning. Relying on a firm mandatory retirement deadline hurts both the lawyer and the firm, especially if there is no succession plan in place. Firms are wiser to ease the severity of the rule and instead impose a soft transition period on a case-by-case basis during which the lawyer could operate in a mentoring capacity to facilitate a smoother transfer of responsibility and relationships.

Moreover, firms have adopted leaner staffing models since the 2009 collapse. After average leverage dropped by 25 percent in one year, it has been slow to rise. Our forecast models estimate that leverage will slightly decrease. This mediates some concerns as there are fewer associates caught in the logjam to partner, but ultimately firms would be better served creating succession plans that allowed for seamless transition of business matters so that they do not lose capable partners.


Executing a proper plan easily solves the dilemmas brought about by mandatory retirement. While identifying an aging leadership problem is helpful, creating and executing an actual plan is a necessity.

# Identical Twin Biglaw Partners Had Fun Together While 'Rescuing' The Pac-12 From Certain Doom
## There may be other identical twins working in Biglaw, but these brothers worked together to save a football conference.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

A lot of it played out over Thanksgiving. We resisted any urge to bill during dinner.

It was really funny to be on constant calls with my twin brother and I had to resist the urge to talk to him as my brother and relate to him more as a professional.

— [David Silbert](https://www.keker.com/Lawyers/Silbert-David) of Keker Van Nest & Peters, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/01/25/meet-the-identical-twins-who-saved-the-pac-12/) on what it was like to work alongside his identical twin brother, [Greg Silbert](https://www.weil.com/people/gregory-silbert) of Weil Gotshal & Manges, in litigation over the fate of the Pac-12. The twins played a vital role in saving the collegiate athletic conference, and they had a good time together while they were at it. “A lot of funny emails back and forth, as we realized what was about to happen,” Greg told Am Law. “It was sort of fun to write ‘conference with Silbert’ in my calendar,” David said.

# Is 'Batshit Crazy' The Technical, Legal Term For A Client?

Attorneys aren’t immune to [some colorful language](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/this-chicago-lawyer-just-became-the-most-relatable-esquire-of-the-day/), but generally it doesn’t work its way into their testimony from the stand.

Law360 [recounts the opening testimony](https://www.law360.com/articles/1440485) in an ongoing defamation case between a tax partner’s widow and the deceased’s former law partner. The widow accused her husband’s partner of swindling her out of insurance proceeds when the partner collected on a “key man” policy in exchange for signing over his interest in the small firm as he moved on to Bilzin Sumberg. The court already ruled in favor of the partner on that score and now the trial turns to the statements the widow made over the course of the dispute.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Enter Brian Goodkind of Goodkind & Florio PA, who took the stand to testify about his former client, widow Sharon Dresser. Goodkind had worked with her in selling the remaining assets of the original firm to Bilzin.

“I received this letter, and I understood her to be threatening me, that I needed to work with her new lawyer to undo the deal or she was going to come after me and make sure it was a very public battle that would hurt my law firm and my reputation,” said Goodkind, who later added that he told Dresser’s attorneys he would not cooperate with them on his testimony because Dresser was “batshit crazy.”

Tell the jury how you really feel.

# Donald Trump Got Indicted For Toilet Espionage But We Still Need To Talk About This Bear Cop

Donald Trump got indicted since we last convened. And then the case got assigned to the same judge who got professionally scorched for trying to bail Trump out in the first place. Apparently he thinks [the government pays people to plead guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/donald-trump-plead-guilty-damages-insanity/)? It’s all very weird. Davis Polk plays follow-the-leader with Skadden and [announces a 4-day in-office work week](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/davis-polk-4-day-office/) — is this the start of a trend or not? Barber Ranen is [no longer Barber Ranen](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/barber-ranen-daugherty-lordan-new-name/) after racist, sexist, and antisemitic [emails between the founders](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/barber-ranen-offensive-emails/) at their last firm came to light. There’s a lot to be said about baked in structures of discrimination and casual bigotry, but also… how did labor and employment attorneys think it was a good idea to put this in writing?

And we [talk about a bear cop](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/winnie-the-narc-authorities-tie-camera-on-bear-property-owners-cry-illegal-search/).

# Biglaw Firm Chooses Associate Over Elon Musk
## Biglaw firm will not be bullied.

Elon Musk (Photo by Diego Donamaria/Getty Images for SXSW)

Elon Musk is a very rich man with a very big platform. And he frequently uses both of those things to aggressively demand that folks do exactly what he wants them to do.

Like remember back in season 1 of the pandemic when he was salty that Alameda County shut down the Tesla plant located there to stop the spread of COVID. He kept the plant open in defiance of local rules, sued the county and eventually — in a move that I am sure is COMPLETELY COINCIDENTAL — the county allowed the plant to remain open. Or when Dr. Mary “Missy” Cummings was appointed as an advisor to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Dr. Cummings authored a study that found Tesla’s autopilot operated inconsistently. When her appointment became public, Musk set off an onslaught on social media vitriol aimed at Dr. Cummings. She’s since recused herself from an investigations involving Tesla.

Anyway, the point is when Musk complains about something loudly enough, it tends to go his way. But it seems like he misunderstood the resolve of a Biglaw firm.

The Wall Street Journal [reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-tesla-asked-law-firm-to-fire-associate-hired-from-sec-11642265007) that Cooley LLP got an “ultimatum” from Musk. The firm represents Tesla in a number of matters, and Musk felt that entitled him to demand they fire an attorney that never worked on any matters on behalf of Tesla. That’s because the firm hired an associate with previous Securities and Exchange Commission experience, and while at the SEC the attorney interviewed Musk as part of an investigation:

At the SEC, the attorney had interviewed Mr. Musk during the agency’s investigation of the Tesla chief executive’s 2018 tweet claiming, wrongly, to have secured funding to potentially take the electric-vehicle maker private.

The probe resulted in a settlement in which Mr. Musk agreed to resign as chairman and pay a $20 million fine. He also agreed to have a Tesla lawyer review in advance tweets about certain topics, including the company’s financial results, sales numbers and proposed business combinations.

When Cooley refused to bow to this demand, Musk reportedly retaliated by pulling work from the firm:

Cooley has declined to fire the attorney, who remains an associate at the firm, the people said. Since early December, Tesla has begun taking steps in several cases to replace Cooley or add additional counsel, legal documents show. Mr. Musk’s rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp., also known as SpaceX, has stopped using Cooley for regulatory work, according to people familiar with the matter.

Good for Cooley for not allowing Musk to dictate their hiring. Listen, Biglaw firms get a lot of (deserved) flack from people (me, I’m people) for their problematic cultures. And when an attorney’s value to a firm is measured in six-minute increments, it’s easy to see how that can turn south. But in standing up against a high-profile client, Cooley put their money [where their mouth](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/5-biglaw-firms-make-fortunes-list-of-the-best-companies-to-work-for-2018/) is. In a[ hot lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/the-hottest-biglaw-practice-areas-for-lateral-moves-and-more/), details like this about a firm that can really make a difference.

# The Journey From Associate To Partner: Navigating New Waters

Welcome to your first day as a partner. Congratulations! 

This significant milestone marks the start of a new chapter, where the skills and expertise you’ve refined as an associate lay the groundwork for a greater challenge: building and managing your own book of business.

With revenue targets often ranging from $1 million to $2 million annually, your role transcends that of a legal practitioner; you are now a pivotal figure in your firm’s strategic growth.

This transition, while daunting, opens up a realm where practice development in law becomes a key facet of your professional identity.

Stepping Into the Spotlight

With the attainment of partnership, you find yourself stepping into a new office, surrounded by the tangible symbols of your achievement — the coveted brass ring of your profession.

This pivotal moment marks the beginning of an expanded role where your duties stretch far beyond the traditional realm of legal tasks.

You are now charged with driving practice development, forging and deepening client relationships, and making strategic decisions that will shape the firm’s trajectory in the legal marketplace.

This broader spectrum of responsibilities often comes without a clear guide, plunging many new partners into territories where the map to success is yet to be drawn.

The transition into this role is not just a step up; it’s a leap into a realm where your impact on the firm’s success is profound — and where the strategies for growth and development are as varied as they are vital.

Expanding Your Toolkit

The conventional wisdom for ascending partners typically emphasizes increasing visibility through speaking engagements or authoring authoritative white papers.

Firms might suggest turning law school friends into client relationships, navigating the fine line between personal friendships and professional alliances.

While these tactics are foundational for establishing oneself as a thought leader, they merely introduce the vast array of skills pivotal for actual practice development.

Delving deeper, the mastery of crucial yet often overlooked abilities becomes indispensable.

This includes devising a strategic plan that goes beyond mere attendance — what’s your blueprint for engagement over the year?

It involves sophisticated management of client relationships, particularly navigating the challenges when a primary contact departs — how will you sustain the client’s trust and business?

Equally important is the development of a personal branding strategy — does your personal brand resonate with your professional ethos and how you wish to be perceived in the legal sphere?

Moreover, understanding how to effectively position your legal services in a crowded market is critical.

These skills are the linchpins in not just meeting, but exceeding your practice development objectives, guiding you to a successful transition from partner in title to partner in action.

Embracing a Broader Learning Curve

The voyage toward mastering these intricate skills veers significantly from the well-trodden paths of legal education and standard firm training.

This journey is one of self-discovery and proactive exploration, a quest where the most adept partners weave their success through a tapestry of mentorship, collaborative peer learning, and a steadfast openness to fresh, external viewpoints that promise new avenues of strategy and insight.

In their pursuit of excellence, some find themselves delving into the wealth of knowledge contained in books, searching for the keys to unlock the full potential of their new roles.

Embracing a wider learning curve means seeking knowledge and strategies from outside conventional legal training frameworks, possibly including industry seminars, business strategy workshops, or insights from professions that have honed client engagement and relationship management.

The subtlety lies in identifying and leveraging external resources that resonate with your unique challenges and aspirations.

As you chart this new course, remember that the most successful journeys are those forged through a blend of internal expertise and strategic external resource utilization.

Here’s to your forthcoming journey.

# Partners Shouldn't Communicate To Associates Through Other People
## Partners should strive to communicate directly with associates whenever possible

Numerous articles on this website have already discussed how law firm partners are not always the best business managers. It makes sense that just because you are good at practicing law does not mean you are good at running a business or managing people. For that reason, many law firms invest in trainings and use consultants in order to improve their administrative practices. However, one of the most important things partners should keep in mind when managing associates is that they should try to communicate with associates directly rather than passing a message through someone else.

When I was 19, I worked as a politics and government teacher for AmeriCorps. As part of our training, all of the AmeriCorps workers needed to attend conflict resolution courses and other classes. One of the things we learned in the training is that people should try not to “triangle” messages through other people. When you pass a message through someone else, you risk the possibility that some or all of the message will be miscommunicated. In addition, it is much harder to receive feedback about a plan if the message is being conveyed through someone else.

Although partners should know that they shouldn’t play a game of “telephone” when communicating with associates, I have seen partners many times throughout my career communicate to associates through other people. When I was working in Biglaw, there was a much more established chain of command than there was [at any other point of my career](https://www.rothmanlawyer.com/jordan-rothman/). The senior partners would usually give large tasks to the junior partners, who would loop in senior associates, who would then provide assignments to junior associates. To be completely honest, that process is sometimes unavoidable in Biglaw. Oftentimes, some Biglaw assignments are so large, and the senior partners are so busy, that it is impractical for the senior partners to dole out all of the work and communicate with everyone about tasks.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
However, this “waterfall of work” has negative consequences. By the time associates heard about the facts of a case and the specifics of an assignment, this information had already passed through a number of people and was not always accurate. Oftentimes, people did not want to seek clarification from individuals above them for fear of being accused of not paying attention the first time.

As an associate in Biglaw, a colleague of mine had to conduct an extensive amount of research for an issue in a brief. However, my colleague mistakenly thought that our client was a defendant, when in reality, our client was the plaintiff! Thus, the research my colleague had spent hours conducting needed to be extensively revised before it was submitted to the partner. From speaking with my colleague, it seemed that the information about the case had been so distorted, since several people had already relayed the details, that our client’s role in the case was unclear.

Another time in my career, I suffered consequences because a partner, for whatever reason, gave me a task through another person rather than communicate with me directly. As an associate at a midsize shop, I was once informed by our office manager that a senior partner told her to tell me that I needed to scan and upload deposition transcripts to our document management system. The office manager informed me that I could not work on any other tasks until the assignment was complete. I have absolutely no idea why that mundane and unnecessary job was so important that I had to spend all of my time for a week on it. In any case, since the order had come through the office manager, I could not directly seek clarification from the senior partner.

A lot of deposition transcripts needed to be uploaded, and literally anyone in the office, including a number of administrative professionals, could have completed this project. In addition, the project was substantial and took me a number of days to complete. However, since the partner had chosen to communicate this assignment through the office manager, I had no way of making suggestions or noting the size of the project to the partner without looking like I was going above the office manager’s head.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

As a result, I spent five or six solid days scanning and uploading transcripts that people would likely never read to our document management system. Our firm probably missed out on thousands of dollars in revenue on the billable hours I did not log since I was conducting this administrative task. Maybe the partner was just being punitive when he tasked me with performing the assignment. However, if the partner had just communicated this assignment to me directly, I could have quickly responded with suggestions or feedback about the size of the project and saved our firm from losing substantial revenue.

I am not sure why partners feel the need to communicate with associates through other people. Some partners are definitely afraid of confrontation, and they feel that communicating through someone else helps avoid directly confronting people. In addition, some partners are just really busy, and there are definitely issues with micromanaging associates as well. However, partners should strive to communicate directly with associates whenever possible. This helps ensure that associates can provide feedback and that associates understand all of the information related to a project.

# What's Going On With Counsel Bonuses?
## Which super-elite Biglaw firm apparently stiffed its counsel on bonuses this year?

What do we talk about when we talk about counsel? The nature and status of the counsel role [varies widely from firm to firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/revamping-the-counsel-role/). Sometimes it’s a holding pen for lawyers (especially laterals) being considered for partner, sometimes it’s tantamount to being a super-senior associate, sometimes it’s a title given to quasi-retired partner (at firms that don’t use the “of counsel” designation), and sometimes it’s some combination of these options.

Not surprisingly, compensation for counsel falls all over the map as well. As seen when we examined the [treatment of counsel in the wake of the 2016 associate pay raise](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/whats-up-with-counsel-salaries/), counsel at some firms make barely more than what senior associates make, and counsel at other firms can earn almost $400,000. (And some counsel — like those at Wachtell Lipton, where many associates break $400,000 — earn in the high six figures, or beyond.)

Things are quiet on the bonus front right now — if you have news about a firm we haven’t covered yet (scroll through our [bonus archives](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/bonuses/) or check [this chart](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/associate-compensation-scorecard-2017-which-firms-have-announced-bonuses/) to see what we’ve already hit), please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) — so now is a good time to talk about counsel comp, especially bonuses. If you have info to share on the subject, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Counsel%20Compensation) or text us (646-820-8477), with the words “Counsel Compensation” as the subject line of your email or in the body of your text message. Depending on on the quantity and quality of submissions, we may write a follow-up story. (We keep our sources anonymous, of course — but because counsel comp is sometimes set individually, feel free to speak in terms of ranges or approximate numbers if you are concerned about inadvertently revealing your identity in the event that we quote from your message, as we might do.)

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We’ll kick off the discussion with a complaint from one of the whitest of white-shoe firms: Davis Polk & Wardwell. From one irate source:

Davis Polk STIFFED counsel this year. They pay a bigger base than other firms, and a smaller bonus, but even the smaller bonus was always part of the deal. They didn’t tell anyone that it wasn’ t being paid, and counsel only found put when, on pay day, nothing hit their accounts.

The associate bonus memo had the standard “counsel bonuses determined and paid as per usual” or something to that effect… except that they weren’t.

The firm likely had a banner year, but determined that no one would notice if they didn’t pay counsel bonuses. Yes, they did raise the base salary in 2017, but by less than the 2016 bonus, so the result was actually a pay decrease for counsel in 2017 compared to 2016.

What does this mean for the treatment of counsel compared to senior associates at DPW?

From the whispers around the office that this caused, apparently almost all counsel get paid the same, with a few getting more if they negotiated for it when they joined, as opposed to being promoted internally from associate.

With the big associate bonuses, the delta in total comp between an eighth-year associate and most of the counsel is shockingly small.

To be sure, it’s hard to feel too sorry for people earning well into the six figures (just as its hard to muster up much sympathy for [millionaire Biglaw partners having to pay more in taxes](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/big-trouble-for-biglaw-partners-from-tax-reform/)). But as a matter of principle, if associates got both a pay raise (in 2016) and the usual bonus (in 2017), then why shouldn’t counsel? There doesn’t seem to be a good reason for counsel compensation to decline while associate (and partner) compensation remains the same or even climbs.

What does your firm do when it comes to counsel comp, and is it fair?

Thanks.

UPDATE (1/10/2018, 5:20 p.m.): The plot thickens. A different source reports that some DPW counsel did receive bonuses, but that it’s all on a case-by-case basis:

Since at least 2012, Davis Polk has not provided every counsel with a bonus. If a bonus is paid, it’s on a case-by-case basis. Gut says that the vast majority don’t get it. The amount in December was ~5% of the counsel base pay, so quite small given the billing rate of counsel….

UPDATE (1/10/2018, 5:20 p.m.): Our original source begs to differ with the first update:

Your other source is inaccurate. Counsel have always been paid bonuses. True, it’s been relatively small compared to associate bonuses given the bigger base, but imagine the wrath if Davis Polk cut associate compensation by 5%.

The other source is making it sound like this was a case-by-case determination based on individual merit. In fact, every counsel I’ve talked to did NOT receive a bonus this year, but DID receive a bonus every prior year.

As I mentioned earlier, there may be some counsel who did receive a bonus because it was specifically agreed to beforehand. But those who are lockstep did not

Regardless of who is in the right, these divergent accounts show that when there’s a lack of transparency around compensation, rumors and confusion will reign. (By the way, we reached out to Davis Polk before publishing the original story; the firm did not get back to us.)

# Greenberg Traurig Pays Cravath Scale Bonus... To Buy A Goat
## Why does a law firm need a goat?

No one really expected Greenberg Traurig, a firm well known for only paying top dollar in the top markets, to fully match Cravath for all of its associates across the country. But it’s safe to say no one expected them to rub this fact in the faces of their associates by ceremonially shelling out $15,000 — the first-year bonus under the Cravath scale — [to buy a goat](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2018/01/05/greenberg-traurig-the-g-o-a-t-of-law-firms/).

They bought a goat. That’s a thing that happened. Let that roll around in your head for a second.

When reached for comment, a Greenberg Traurig spokesperson explained, “the firm has a long tradition of contributing to the National Western Scholarship Trust to fund scholarships in agriculture and rural medicine at colleges throughout Colorado and Wyoming to support students committed to raising the next generation of goats to sacrifice to our dark lord Baphomet. The time of reckoning is almost upon us. You shall not escape His judgment.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As it turns out, that quote is only half true. While it’s unclear why a Miami-based firm got into sponsoring agricultural scholarships, it’s a longtime sponsor and is proud to shell out $15,000 for the “‘reserve grand champion goat’ owned by 15-year-old Tara Hummel of Cabery, Illinois.” Hummel, a quick search reveals, is the LeBron James of goat-raising, having won awards annually for her goats for years. At least Greenberg Traurig is backing a winner.

Still, this is probably a bitter pill to swallow for Greenberg Traurig associates toiling into the wee hours. One suspects after hearing this news, somewhere in the offices of Greenberg Traurig, a partner is addressing associates: “Some of you have been wondering how you’ll pay your student loans this year. We hear your concerns, but have you seen this goat? Look… it thinks it’s people! Just like you seem to.”

Earlier this week, we took some time to share with you the concerns of some [very peeved associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/lets-hear-from-the-furious-associates-at-firms-that-havent-matched/) at firms that hadn’t announced raises yet. Within a matter of hours, [Haynes and Boone matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/prodigal-law-firm-returns-to-cravath-scale/) (mostly… and [unless you’re a counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/whats-up-with-counsel-salaries/)) and earlier today [Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/jones-day-finally-raises-help-us-open-up-its-black-box-of-compensation/) managed to get something out to associates.

Given our success rate, we figured we’d give it another go. Behold the irate associates!

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Hard to believe it was only last month that Hunton & Williams [moved all its domestic associates to a $160K scale](http://www.law360.com/articles/793622/hunton-williams-1st-years-see-pay-hike-to-160k), no matter [what the cost of living](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/). After this month, the H&W partners must feel like they brought a knife to the proverbial gun party.

Recall earlier this year they announced all US offices to $160k, which is/was way above market in places like Charlotte, Miami, and HQ Richmond. So in some respects they have established themselves as a compensation leader (at least in smaller markets).

But other offices that were already at $160k (NY, DC, Texas) haven’t heard a thing. What gives? Those three markets have clearly moved to $180k. H&W certainly isn’t V25 or anything, but even peer firms have moved. At least in Texas (Bracewell, Locke Lord). Does H&W management think the $160k for everyone was enough?

Historically, H&W has precedent of matching (in Texas, at least). In fact, last go-around in ’07, Hunton announced $160k in NY and $145k everywhere else (in February). Shockingly, that was $10k above market in Texas! V&E & BB (and everyone else) didn’t move from $135k to $160k until later that summer (in July). And H&W soon followed to $160k in Texas. But for 5 months, H&W was very solidly a market comp leader!

When you look at it that way — and consider how shocking it seemed a month ago that a firm would actually pay lawyers in Richmond the top NY salary — H&W really was ahead of the times. They were very proud of those raises a month ago, but everything that’s happened since must have hit them like Floyd Mayweather hits defenseless people around him.

Long story short, we’ve still heard nothing out of Richmond, where fellow Virginia-based firm, McGuireWoods, is going out of its way to [keep out of the salary news](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/these-partners-desperately-dont-want-us-to-know-they-arent-raising-salaries/).

Foley & Lardner

Speaking of furious associates, the Foley & Lardner folks are pretty pissed off about management pretending these raises are not happening… Could we perhaps mention them in a post to give them the kick in the butt they need???!!

Usually it’s dumpees and not [dumpers](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/foley-lardner-to-leave-eversheds-standing-at-the-altar/) who can’t move on with their lives.

BakerHostetler

Not sure whether others have emailed, but still awaiting ANY information from BakerHostetler regarding match or any adjustment to associate compensation. Firm is very black box when it comes to compensation, and I wouldn’t be surprised if management tries to pretend they’re not aware of what is happening in the market. Partners in the firm are doing very well for themselves (they recently ditched their non-equity track to further boost profitability), and it would be nice if (for once) they shared some of the benefit with the hardworking associates. Comp at BH has always been lower than market (especially with bonuses), so I would frankly be surprised if they increase everyone’s salary more than marginally.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We usually respect anonymity, but we have to make an exception here. That tip comes from none other than [BakerHostetler’s ROSS the Robot](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/bakerhostetler-hires-a-i-lawyer-ushers-in-the-legal-apocalypse/). Gotta hand it IBM. We knew it was an impressive invention, but machine learning to bitch about salary? That’s the future of law.

BuckleySandler

All offices. Wtf. Despite super high ppp and billables.

Last year this was one of the [top ten firms to work for](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-2015-2/). Just sayin’…

Norton Rose Fulbright

Hoo boy, people are really, really mad at Norton Rose Fulbright. Honestly, I haven’t seen Texas lawyers this upset since [the last time I wrote about their housing market](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/answering-your-complaints-about-the-cost-of-living-post/)…

What about Norton Rose Fulbright?!?

Top-ranked Texas firm bested by much lower-ranked firms.
Bracewell?? Now HayBoo?! And Locke Lord?!?!??!

In light of declining PPP post merger, associates see this is as v concerning

And another…

Only non-regional firm in Texas that hasn’t matched. Ridiculous.

And another…

Norton Rose Fulbright, for instance, has not matched. Management has also not communicated anything about this directly to associates, so we have no idea what is happening. We have only been told indirectly that they are “aware” of the raises and are looking into it.

Well, I’m sure the London-based firm will come through now that… oh! [Oh dear God no](https://twitter.com/JosephPatrice/status/746188133595815936)!

Herbert Smith Freehills

All Magic and one Silver circle firm match, except Herbert Smith Freehills NYC has NOT. Morale rock bottom. Turnover staff and attorneys already sky high.

When reached this morning, HSF’s London headquarters said they were too busy stockpiling creamed corn and preparing for The Purge to comment.

Venable

Venable is one of the remaining firms with PPP in excess of $1 million that has not matched the new market salary scale.

While Venable had previously matched the old market scale for the most junior associates, salaries at the mid and senior levels lagged the old market. Now that the entire market scale has increased again, salaries for mid and senior level associates at Venable are significantly below the market. For example, the median salary for associates from the Class of 2010 is currently $225,000, which is $55,000 below the current market rate of $280,000. With such a significant shortfall, I can’t imagine why anyone would stay at Venable or why any law students or laterals would consider Venable if they have any other options. The firm needs to adjust salaries and value associates appropriately or even more of us are going to leave this year and we’re going to have a lot of trouble recruiting new associates.

Another tipster agreed with the frustration of older associates:

Mid level and senior associates at Venable are definitely concerned about a Reed Smith type situation happening here. We only raised to market for juniors a few years ago, but the rest of the compression situation is frustrating. No raises here yet, but if they do, I’m guessing the email will look a lot like Reed Smith’s. Frustrating especially watching Steptoe raise today.

Yeah, let’s not forget that Reed Smith may have raised salaries, but [it left a TON of angry older lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-does-right-by-junior-associates-mid-levels-and-senior-associates-not-so-much/) in its wake.

Troutman

It seems like the heads of the firm are completely ignoring the whole situation. If Troutman is being marketed as a “top firm in Atlanta,” the associates should get paid like King & Spalding or, at least, Alston & Bird (even firms not based in Atlanta are raising Atlanta salaries). If they can’t get bonuses right (a separate but equal point of contention), they can (at a minimum) keep competitive with salaries of our Atlanta peer” firms.

Yes, raises are probably in order. But, not to sound like a broken record, it’s also possible that King & Spalding and Alston & Bird are overpaying in Atlanta right now. As we watch the NYSE tumble (down around 400 as I type this), and remember that attorney salary raises tend to hit [right when the party’s almost over](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/), perhaps it’s worth hanging back a tad. Long-term, it may be better to be the “just a smidgen under top firm in Atlanta” at this time.

Texas Boutiques

This is an interesting, non-Biglaw addendum. Not altogether sure what to make of it, but it’s worth knowing that lawyers in the market are now wary even of boutiques who aren’t raising:

I’d like to point out that two firms that are considered litigation leaders in Texas– Beck Redden and Gibbs & Bruns– have not yet matched. According to Chambers and Partners, they are two of three “Band 1” firms in Texas for commercial litigation along with Susman Godfrey.
http://www.chambersandpartners.com/13235/228/editorial/5/1

This in light of two other Houston-based litigation boutiques– Susman and Yetter Coleman– matching their salaries (not to mention McKool).

I know ATL has focused on pressures for the Big Law firms in Texas. I hope you can give some coverage to these Texas litigation boutiques as well.

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”).

If you’re finding that some lawyers at Biglaw firms are slow in getting back to you today, there could be a very good reason. It could be that their firms are observing today — June 19, aka [Juneteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth) — as a holiday. And rightfully so.

For those of you who aren’t familiar with Juneteenth, here’s a short explainer, from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/article/juneteenth-day-celebration.html):

On June 19, 1865, about two months after the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox, Va., Union Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform enslaved African-Americans of their freedom and that the Civil War had ended. General Granger’s announcement put into effect the Emancipation Proclamation, which had been issued more than two and a half years earlier on Jan. 1, 1863, by President Abraham Lincoln.

The holiday received its name by combining June and 19. The day is also sometimes called “Juneteenth Independence Day,” “Freedom Day” or “Emancipation Day.”

For lawyers, who put great stock in the power of words, Juneteenth is an important reminder that words must be supported by action. For all too many enslaved African-Americans, freedom didn’t become a reality with the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation; it instead had to wait until the end of the Civil War and the arrival of Juneteenth.

As lawyers, we understand the meaning of equality and freedom from a perspective that is unique because of our legal training. We also understand that we have to keep defending equality and freedom on a daily basis. A day of observance is important for reflecting and planning on a course of action to preserve these values.

To their great credit, numerous Biglaw firms have [declared Juneteenth to be a firm-wide holiday](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/in-house-counsel/more-big-law-firms-opt-to-observe-juneteenth-at-offices). According to Above the Law’s [running tally](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/skadden-declares-juneteeth-a-firmwide-holiday/), more than 50 major law firms are observing Juneteenth today, in some form or another. This is a good thing, especially in light of [data](https://www.mcca.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2019-Vault_MCCA-Law-Firm-Diversity-Survey-Report.pdf) from Vault and the Minority Corporate Counsel Association (MCCA) showing that black lawyers account for just 4.83 percent of associates and 1.94 percent of equity partners in law firms.

What to make of Biglaw’s embrace of Juneteenth? I agree with [Kathryn Rubino](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/skadden-declares-juneteeth-a-firmwide-holiday/):

In the grand scheme of fighting systemic racism in this country, is this a relatively minor step? Yes. Is it an awesome thing? Also, yes.

Celebrating Juneteenth is a good thing. Too many kids grow up never even learning about the holiday.

Kathryn’s point about widespread unfamiliarity with Juneteenth is well-taken. I’ve been around a while, and I only learned about it last year (despite the fact that June 19 is also my birthday).

Our society needs to do a better job of educating people about the significance of today. And hopefully the observance of Juneteenth by law firms, as well as many other [major businesses](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/in-house-counsel/more-big-law-firms-opt-to-observe-juneteenth-at-offices) — [such as](https://www.nytimes.com/article/juneteenth-day-celebration.html) Nike, Twitter, Best Buy, Target, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, and the NFL — will help on this score.

Some 46 states, as well as the District of Columbia, have moved to recognize Juneteenth as a holiday. Could it eventually become a national holiday?

Let’s hope so. There have certainly been efforts made on this front, including an [online petition](https://www.change.org/p/united-states-congress-make-juneteenth-a-national-holiday-in-2020) (with more than 300,000 signatures), a [Senate resolution](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-resolution/547/text), and a call for recognition [by Senator Bernie Sanders](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1141378841493102594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1141378841493102594&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fcampaign%2F449338-bernie-sanders-juneteenth-should-be-a-national-holiday) (made last year, well before the horrific killing of George Floyd and the national discussion about racial injustice it has generated).

Regardless of whether your law firm or employer observes Juneteenth, please take time today to reflect upon the legacy of slavery, the progress our nation has made on issues of racial justice, and all the work that remains to be done to combat ongoing [racism in our society](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/the-weight-of-blackness/). And then, after you have done so, [take](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/06/07/870251488/beyond-protests-5-more-ways-to-channel-anger-into-action-to-fight-racism) some [action](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/opinion/whites-anti-blackness-protests.html) — which is, after all, what Juneteenth is all about.

# Everyone Drops All Their Suits In Dershowitz-Giuffre-Boies Matter
## And so it ends.

A long, convoluted series of cases left in Jeffrey Epstein’s wake has come to an end. Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking operation, alleged that Epstein forced her to have sex with a number of men while she was a girl. One of the men she identified was Alan Dershowitz, Epstein’s former lawyer ([who bizarrely said he thought Epstein should’ve gotten a better deal](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/alan-dershowitz-says-he-thinks-he-shouldve-gotten-epstein-a-better-deal-in-wild-doubling-down-interview/) after Epstein’s full operation came to light — like, dude, read the room). Giuffre now admits that over the course of her traumatic ordeal she “[may have made a mistake in identifying Mr. Dershowitz](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/epstein-victim-drops-lawsuit-lawyer-alan-dershowitz-rcna56250).”

This triggered a wave of dismissals yesterday. Giuffre’s allegations had prompted Dershowitz to call her a liar and demand she sue him for defamation if she thought he was wrong. So [Giuffre sued Dershowitz for defamation](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/dershowitz-wanted-a-trial-over-sex-trafficking-accusations-hes-getting-one/). Then Dershowitz sued Giuffre for defamation. Somewhere along the way we [had to hear about Dershowitz’s underwear](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/i-just-had-to-think-about-alan-dershowitzs-underwear-and-now-so-do-you/) and [perfect sex life](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/alan-dershowitz-says-he-has-a-perfect-sex-life-answering-the-question-literally-no-one-asked/) giving the rest of America an infliction of emotional distress claim that mercifully no one brought. Then Dershowitz [sought to get Boies Schiller disqualified from representing Giuffre](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/harvard-law-schools-dershowitz-moves-to-disqualify-boies-schiller-in-sex-trafficking-case/) — which [took](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/dershowitz-harvard-law-school-motion-to-disqualify-boies-schiller-immediately-dumped-for-hilarious-reason/) a [few tries](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/some-tentative-good-news-for-harvard-law-school-alan-dershowitz-and-some-more-bad-news/) to get filed right — on the grounds that the Harvard law professor claimed David Boies was extorting him. Giuffre hired Chuck Cooper to replace Boies and then Dershowitz came out and said Boies and his firm were “a RICO”… so [Boies sued Dershowitz for defamation](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/david-boies-sues-alan-dershowitz-becomes-a-pro-se-litigant/).

Now the whole series of lawsuits have been dropped with no money changing hands in the whole web.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Dershowitz had accused Boies of engaging in an extortion plot and in suborning perjury. Boies countersued Dershowitz for defamation.

“I agree with Mr. Dershowitz and Ms. Giuffre that the time has come to end this litigation and move on,” Boies said. “I know that Alan Dershowitz has suffered greatly from the allegation of sexual abuse — an allegation that he has consistently, and vehemently, denied.”

Boies added: “I appreciate Mr. Dershowitz’s recognition that I was not engaged in an extortion plot or in suborning perjury.”

In his statement, Dershowitz said he now believes that his allegations against Boies “were mistaken.”

All of the parties said in a joint statement that the resolution does not involve the payment of any money “by anyone or anything else.”

And with one blow, they’ve severed this Gordian knot of litigation.

Unfortunately, this still won’t make Dershowitz popular on Martha’s Vineyard.
