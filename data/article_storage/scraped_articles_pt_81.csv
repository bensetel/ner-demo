# 3 Epic Humblebrags!

First things first: [Yet another thought](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/2-thoughts-on-what-to-do-when-youre-exhausted-and-just-want-to-mail-it-in/) on ginning up titles for online columns.

This week, I start my title with an Arabic number: “3.” That’s the key to attracting readers. I follow with an adjective. Nothing intelligent comes to mind, so I’ll settle for the generic one that sounds like it means something: “Epic.” And then I’ll use a word that I suspect only recently moved from the [Urban](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=humblebrag) to the [Oxford](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/humblebrag) dictionary: “Humblebrag.” I stuck the exclamation point on at the end as an experiment. I’ve never tried that before, but maybe hysterical punctuation draws more readers on the web.

Perfect!

(Or perhaps: Perfect!!!)

I have no clue what “3 Epic Humblebrags!” means, but I bet I’ll draw eyeballs like there’s no tomorrow.

Now, what will I write?

Just kidding. I actually have three ideas in mind.

The first “epic humblebrag” comes from my days in private practice. I’d co-author (with an industrious associate) an article to help raise our firm’s profile and convince the world that we knew something about some field of law. I (or perhaps the associate) had represented a party in a couple of cases in the area, which is why we had an idea that was worth publishing. We’d also represented parties in a few other cases that were only marginally relevant to the topic of the article, but with a little imagination you could shoehorn into the article cites to those cases.

I’d naturally suggest that the associate get out the shoehorn and start citing the damn-near-irrelevant cases that we had worked on.

The associate would raise an eyebrow: “Why are we working so hard to cite these cases, when they have so little to do with our thesis?”

“The conflict-of-interest disclosure footnote.”

“Huh?”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“We’re obligated to identify in the conflict disclosure footnote if we worked on any of the cases cited in the article. Don’t think of that as disclosing conflicts of interest. Think of it as an opportunity to brag. If we identify in the conflict disclosure footnote only one or two cases that we worked on, readers will think that we have some passing familiarity with the legal field that we’re writing about. But if we identify in the conflict disclosure footnote a half dozen or more cases that we worked on, readers will think that we’re the leading practitioners in the area. So write the article with one eye on citing every possible case that we’re obligated to identify in the conflict footnote. Those aren’t disclosures of conflicts; they’re proof of our expertise!”

How’s that for a very humble brag?

Epic humblebrag number two.

I co-authored (with a relatively prominent fellow) an article. We sent our draft article out to ten or twelve professors (and other famous folks) to solicit their comments on our draft. Some of the reviewers were quite helpful, suggesting substantive revisions or marking up the entire draft. Other reviewers basically blew us off: “Thanks for sending the draft article. I don’t really have time to look at it. But I noticed there’s a typo in the title: You misspelled ‘securities.'” Or equally silly stuff.

When we wrote the acknowledgments footnote, we acknowledged the efforts of basically everyone to whom we’d sent drafts. (I no longer remember if we acknowledged people who simply ignored us, or who wrote back, “I won’t have time to look at the draft. Sorry.” But we may have.) We dutifully wrote in the acknowledgments footnote: “The authors would like to thank the following people for having provided extraordinarily helpful comments on an early draft of this article: [and listing the famous folks to whom we’d sent drafts].”

This time, I was the neophyte: “Some of those guys did no more than fix a typo.” (Maybe — I no longer remember: “Some of those guys just said they didn’t have time to review the draft.”) “Why are we saying those people provided useful comments? They didn’t provide useful comments. They added nothing to what we wrote.”

“Herrmann, you silly goose.” [Or words to that effect.] “We’re not actually acknowledging help provided by these people. We’re proving that we hang around with famous guys. If we say that some famous person commented on our article, then we’re implicitly telling the world that a famous person cared about what we wrote and took the time to read it. That means that we’re important people, and that our work is worth reading. This isn’t a matter of acknowledging help; it’s all about validating yourself in the field.”

Of course it is. I’m a fool.

Last epic humblebrag.

Okay: This isn’t really a humblebrag. It’s more a routine scam.

Your high school calls to say that you’ve been selected as alumni of the year, and the school will be recognizing you at the annual dinner.

This is great! Your high school thinks you’re a prominent alumni.

Or maybe not: Maybe the high school figures that, if you’re being recognized as alumni of the year, you’ll buy a couple of tables to the awards dinner, allowing you to invite friends to the dinner and the high school to pocket the dough.

Or, alternatively, some online outfit runs a contest to choose the “blog of the year.” Is that really meant to select the blog of the year? Or is it meant to encourage the bloggers competing for the award to link to the outfit that’s running the contest, thus pushing a huge number of page views (and, by extension, money) to the sponsor?

Or, alternatively, a publisher is picking the law firm (or individual lawyer, or in-house law department) of the year. Is that really meant to recognize the law firm, or is it more a way to sell magazines?

Yeah, yeah: We live in a capitalist system, and it’s okay to run a contest that profits both the person who sponsors the contest and the person who wins it. But winning one of those awards isn’t exactly like pocketing a Nobel Prize or receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor.

It’s more like a humblebrag, don’t you think?

Over the past decade, Lateral Link has become a preeminent player in the legal recruiting industry. As we continue to grow our global footprint, we are looking to add recruiters to our California team.

Our Success

Lateral Link has made thousands of placements with almost every Am Law 200 law firm. Not only do we have personal relationships with decision-makers at the biggest and best firms in the nation, but our exclusives with — and insider information about — some of the most desirable law firms separate us from all of our competitors in the field. We are a market leader, not a follower.

Moreover, we hire only the best. Almost all of our recruiters are law school graduates with extensive Biglaw experience. Here are a few of the law schools we represent:

- Yale Law School
- Harvard Law School
- NYU School of Law
- University of Pennsylvania School of Law
- University of Virginia School of Law
- Georgetown University Law Center
- Vanderbilt Law School
- Washington University School of Law
- USC Gould School of Law
- Boston College Law School
- Emory University School of Law
And here are some of the law firms where we have worked:

- Akin Gump
- Cahill Gordon
- Cleary Gottlieb
- Fried Frank
- Gibson Dunn
- Irell & Manella
- Jones Day
- Kirkland & Ellis
- Mayer Brown
- McGuireWoods
- Milbank
- Morrison & Foerster
- Pillsbury Winthrop
- Quinn Emanuel
- Wachtell Lipton
- Weil Gotshal
- White & Case
- Winston & Strawn
Highest Compensation in Our Industry

We understand that hiring and retaining the best legal recruiters requires spreading the wealth. Not only do you deserve it, but you should demand it.  Lateral Link’s recruiters earn 50-85 percent above the market.  Also, our Principals partake in real profit sharing. Our compensation formula favors hard workers and high earners, so the more you make, the more you keep. Here’s a preview below of our compensation structure, not including bonuses and profit sharing:



Teamwork & Culture

If you have to define the legal recruiting industry, you would probably say it is a “dog eat dog world.” At Lateral Link, our recruiters find that working together and collaborating on searches give us an edge over our regional and national competition.

For those of you already in recruiting, if you don’t have access to decisionmakers and your brand isn’t opening the door in a meaningful way, why are you bringing more to a platform than what you are giving? We encourage you to look at the contributions you make. Is your platform really helping you?

Many Perks

We know the business aspect is important, but we also like to have fun at Lateral Link. We believe it is important to bring all of our colleagues together, from across the nation, at company retreats and other team-building events.

If you are interested in working for us, please email [sadajian@laterallink.com](mailto:sadajian@laterallink.com) or [click here](https://laterallink.com/join-us/) to apply. We look forward to hearing from you.

# Biglaw Partner Tries To Honor MLK's Legacy By Dunking On The Libs

Well. It happened again.

It’s Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, and as is tradition, somebody started it off properly by misusing the man’s legacy to shame Black people, their allies, and the causes MLK stood for in his lifetime. And who better than White & Case’s “[Reply All](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/biglaw-partner-so-peeved-by-pro-bono-assignment-he-hits-reply-all-to-whine-about-it/)” partner Thomas Lauria to start us off.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Now to his credit, Lauria did not actually say Black people or BLM, but much like when folks say “inner city youths”, [we know who they’re talking about](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O0UhvPuYS3A). I just get the feeling that when Lauria is talking about today’s messages of suspicion, entitlement, blame, hatred and retribution, he’s not talking about the people who stormed the Capitol and [attempted to abduct and or kill congress people and the vice president](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/it-was-much-worse-it-looked/617693/) about a year ago. I fear the consequences one would face if you called the average QHead a liberal or progressive after all.

When I read Lauria’s teary-eyed, heart beating email (he must have been vibing out to some really good, uncut MLK speech at the time) my mind darted to this specific scene of The Boondocks — I doubt I’m the only one:

That said, I’m going to take this moment to make a compilation of the things MLK actual said. One reason is that I think finding and listening to the words he cared enough to speak bravely on is a way to honor him. The second is that I know a bunch of Black folks will be inundated with unseasoned, decontextualized “I Have A Dream” quotes from Trump supporters with #BackTheBlue stripes on their The Punisher decals. Let this article be an easy go to for you when you get unsolicited and uniformed opinions on why MLK would actually be against police officers wearing body cameras or whatever.

Here’s MLK saying the 1970’s version of Black Lives Matter:

Here is MLK talking directly to people who give lip service to civil rights but do nothing to actually support it:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Here’s MLK saying the people being subsidized for the government are the ones telling Black folks to pick themselves up by their bootstraps:

We love “I Have A Dream.” Its power and bold truths are often manipulated and misinterpreted.

But this is the seldom quoted and rarely publicized [#MLK](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MLK?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), speaking here about racial injustice + economic injustice.

These twin injustices contribute to the effects of [#COVID19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) today. [pic.twitter.com/NAxmIG20Gj](https://t.co/NAxmIG20Gj)

— The Martin Luther King, Jr. Center (@TheKingCenter) [April 4, 2020](https://twitter.com/TheKingCenter/status/1246463396662456321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Here’s MLK saying problems exist because of continued segregation and discrimination and that to ignore the causes and look only at effects is absurd:

Happy MLK day Canes fans. Here’s a video of MLK Jr. speaking at the University of Miami in 1966.

One of the most influential people in world history and a man who truly wanted to make the world a better place. [#LoveOverHate](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LoveOverHate?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) ❤️ [pic.twitter.com/l5KhA5Lr7P](https://t.co/l5KhA5Lr7P)

And for when you get called a Communist Marxist Anarchist or something, here’s MLK saying America ought implement Basic Universal Income:

With all the kumbaya and [harambe-ing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_rLRP709zU) from folks like Lauria, it is easy to forget that [MLK was one of the most hated people in America during his life time](https://www.iestork.org/martin-luther-king-jr-the-most-hated-man-in-america/). The vitriol seen toward BLM protestors? [Yeah he got that in while he was still breathing](https://time.com/5096937/martin-luther-king-jr-picture-chicago/). But you know what else happened? He talked. He talked a lot. And he wrote, too.  His life and legacy is so much more than the 1963 speech that gets thrown around when McDonald’s need a commercial or Black people get too uppity. Look for yourself — [maybe even read a little](https://crossculturalsolidarity.com/mlk-speeches-sermons-essays/).

In closing, let’s once again thank Lauria for doing the second most American thing possible to MLK — using his talk of love and equality to shame and shut up those scary Blacks that won’t leave us alone — be it Malcolm X or BLM protestors. And if you were curious, the third is locking him up for peacefully protesting ([that’s how we got this gem after all](https://www.csuchico.edu/iege/_assets/documents/susi-letter-from-birmingham-jail.pdf)). The first, of course, was murdering him.

Happy MLK weekend.

The construction industry is one of the largest and most lucrative in the country. Construction lawyers assist with every aspect of a building project, from the initial land selection and development, to any disputes or insurance issues that may arise after construction is complete.

2. Best Firm to Handle Complex Litigation Disputes:[ Pepper Hamilton](https://www.pepperlaw.com/capabilities/construction-law/)

With so many phases and moving parts, litigation and disputes are an inevitable reality of any complex construction project.

Named the “Construction Law Firm of the Year 2018” by Chambers USA, the firm has handled more than a dozen complex construction litigations worth more than $50 million in the last five years alone.

3. Best Firm For When Your Growing Startup Needs More Room to Expand:[ Perkins Coie LLP](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/practices/litigation-dispute-resolution/construction.html)

4. Best Law Firm for Land Development Projects:[ Greenberg Traurig](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/capabilities/litigation/construction-law)

Much like its competitors, Greenberg Traurig is more than capable of handling the most complex of construction matters, on both the transactional and litigation sides. Where the firm really stands out, though, is in its more nuanced niche specialties, like its Land Development Group. Greenberg Traurig’s experienced attorneys have guided numerous entrepreneurs, landowners, and joint venture partners through the development process, from financing, to permitting, to occupancy. If your next construction project involves a land development component, these are the folks you want on speed dial.

5. Best Firm for Building That New Power Plant:[ Alston & Bird LLP](https://www.alston.com/en/services/practices/litigation/construction)

Insurance is a critical part of any construction project.

# Biglaw Head Bought Neil Gorsuch's Property In 2017. Yes, We Are Just Learning About It Now.
## This is not how judicial ethics is supposed to work.

The Supreme Court is having a real [legitimacy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/john-roberts-is-a-man-in-desperate-search-of-legitimacy/) problem. Besides the questionable nature of some of[ their decisions](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/justice-elena-kagan-thinks-the-supreme-court-completely-blew-its-legitimacy-in-the-dobbs-case/), the[ ethics scandals](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/clarence-thomass-piss-ass-excuse-for-not-disclosing-megadonor-real-estate-sale/) are just nonstop these days. And there’s a new revelation.

In 2005, Neil Gorsuch purchased a property in Colorado as part of an LLC, Walden Group. By 2015, the co-owners were seeking to sell the property. In 2017, after Gorsuch was elevated to the Supreme Court a buyer for the property was found and the deal closed for $1.825 million.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The sale netted Gorsuch between $250,001 and $500,000 — something we know because it was listed on his [federal disclosure forms](https://fixthecourt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Gorsuch-NM-J3.-SUP_R_17.pdf). So, maybe the system works as intended, and [Clarence Thomas](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/clarence-thomas/) and all his ethics woes are the true outlier? HAHAHAHAHA. No. The identity of the purchaser was not known at the time… because Gorsuch left that box blank.

It’s only now that Politico [reports ](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/25/neil-gorsuch-colorado-property-sale-00093579)the purchaser was[ Brian Duffy](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/d/duffy-brian-l), Chief Executive Officer at Greenberg Traurig. The Biglaw firm has been involved in 22 cases before or presented to the Court.

They include cases in which Greenberg either filed amicus briefs or represented parties. In the 12 cases where Gorsuch’s opinion is recorded, he sided with Greenberg Traurig clients eight times and against them four times.

In addition, a Denver-based lawyer for Greenberg represented North Dakota in what became one of the more highly publicized rulings in recent years, a multistate suit which reversed former President Barack Obama’s plan to fight climate change through the Clean Air Act.

Gorsuch joined the court’s other five conservative judges in agreeing with the plaintiffs — including Greenberg’s client — that the Environmental Protection Agency had overstepped its authority by regulating carbon emissions from power plants in the decision that makes it more difficult for the executive branch to regulate emissions without express authorization from Congress.

Duffy says he doesn’t actually know Gorsuch and didn’t even realize at first that Gorsuch had an ownership interest in the property, saying, “The fact that he was going to be a Supreme Court justice was absolutely irrelevant to the purchase of that property. It’s a wonderful piece of property and we’re so glad we bought it.”

In fact, Duffy, who historically has donated to Democratic political candidates, never even met him.

“I’ve never spoken to him,” Duffy said. “I’ve never met him.”

Once he learned Gorsuch was among the owners, Duffy said, he cleared the sale with his firm’s ethics department.

And here’s the thing — in my heart I do not believe this transaction changed a single vote Neil Gorsuch has made in his time on the Court. But WHY didn’t he disclose Duffy’s identity? There’s a box right there on the form just begging to be filled out. The standard is supposed to be avoiding the mere appearance of impropriety. Violating that is the problem.

In his disclosures, Gorsuch told us who gifted him a fishing rod, a watercolor painting, and cowboy boots. But the identity of the person who bought his $1.8 million property? Gorsuch kept that one to himself. Wonder why. [https://t.co/88bfjYJR8L](https://t.co/88bfjYJR8L) [pic.twitter.com/5G1pSPoBAR](https://t.co/5G1pSPoBAR)

Plus it seems to be endemic at the Court, as Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) noted, “We have seen a steady stream of revelations regarding Supreme Court Justices falling short of the ethical standards expected of other federal judges and of public servants.” “The need for Supreme Court ethics reform is clear, and if the Court does not take adequate action, Congress must. The Senate Judiciary Committee will be closely examining these matters in the coming weeks,” said Durbin.

Revelations about the Court’s undisclosed financial dealings don’t seem to in short supply, but the public’s trust in the institution? That’s a lot more limited.

# 'Legal Tech Lists': 5 MORE Lawyer Tropes That Were Upended By Legal Tech
## Expanding our list of common scenarios that would be solved by technology.

Editor’s note: This is an installment in the “Reference Manual of Legal Tech Lists,” an eBook set for release this spring. [Read the prior installments here](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/wolters-kluwer-lists/), and feel free to pre-register for your copy of the complete eBook using the form below.

There are lots of tropes related to lawyers and law firms that frequently show up in works of fiction. 

The thing is, those tropes are tropes because they’re sort of old; they’ve been around for a long time.

Now, however, modern technology can solve a heck of a lot of those issues.

So, for this edition of the “Reference Manual of Lists,” we’re going to relay a trope, offer an example, and talk about how legal tech actually fixes the problem today. [(Catch up on the first five here.) ](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/legal-tech-lists-5-lawyer-tropes-that-were-upended-by-legal-tech/)

Trope 6: [Kidnapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapped_(novel))!

Lawyers in television and film are often portrayed as targets for bad actors.  They’re always getting kidnapped, or ransomed, or shot at. 

Sometimes they’re *trying to do the right thing* and are targeted for that; other times, they’re bad actors themselves; and, some other times, they’re truly just collateral damage. It ain’t easy bein’ a JD.

Exemplary Scene: [In “Breaking Bad,” Saul Goodman gets snatched, and brought out to the desert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnJHpGyhUts), so Walt and Jesse can threaten him. This is in the early stages of Walt’s burgeoning criminal enterprise, and, Saul deals in flip phones (“burner phones”), for criminals — it’s really amateur hour, all around.

But, I feel like, if Saul had a smartphone, Walt and Jesse might not even have checked for that. But, he doesn’t end up needing it, because he convinces Walt and Jesse that he’s better off alive, than dead, for their purposes.

The Modern, LegalTech Solution: Of course, if Saul was carrying a smartphone around, he could have been tracked, via location services.

Trope 7: Conflict? Check.

It’s the worst thing in the world for an attorney — you’re knee-deep in a representation, and you discover a conflict.  What’s worse still is if it’s one you should have picked up on prior to signing the client. Better ring up your malpractice carrier — because it’s on, now!

Exemplary Scene: So, as you might expect, there aren’t a lot of movies or television shows that depict an attorney staring intently at a computer screen, trying to define whether a conflict exists. Let’s face it: That is kind of boring. 

But, conflicts always come up in the context of divorce, within the entertainment industrial complex. Whenever characters get divorced, they’re racing to conflict out every attorney in town. [This actually just happened in the second episode of the fourth season of “Succession](https://www.distractify.com/p/conflicted-out-meaning-succession).”

The Modern, LegalTech Solution: Now, there isn’t any tool that is an “automated” conflict checker — despite the fact that attorneys would really, really like something like that. 

I think that’s probably an AI tool, down the road, but the current systems aren’t sophisticated enough to manage that, on their own. I know, it’s a bummer. 

However, since most of the softwares you use in your law practice are, at some level, contact management tools, you can run a contact search within your system, to see whether your new lead shares a corporate name, last name or address with one of your existing clients.

Many systems will also automate a conflict alert, to let you know (without your having to look) whether one of those potential issues exists — then, you can make the ultimate call on the conflict, as a full-fledged human being.

Trope 8: Small Time, Big Time

Especially if you’re a new attorney — or, if you happen to be low-ranking — office space can get scarce. You may be feeling like you’re working out of a closet — because you are. 

And, this is a consistent trope in film, as well — the new, wide-eyed employee has all her stuff together for her first day at the office, only to have her dreams ruptured by the opening of a door, leading into the smallest office imaginable.  Or, I guess it could be worse: You could be ushered into a cubicle.

Exemplary Scene: [In the cult classic 1999 movie, “Office Space,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space) Milton is always getting [shafted by Lumberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNVqMgCAHmk).  [His office cubicle moves from the main floor, to a darkened basement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ApqwRp7L8). So, I guess it could always get even worse. Just don’t burn the building down, okay?

The Modern, LegalTech Solution: Both “Office Space” and office space are sort of vestiges of the pre-pandemic time, as it’s unlikely that the traditional 9 to 5 office job is going to make a comeback — at least for knowledge workers, like attorneys. 

With the availability of cloud software, you can do pretty much anything you can do at your office, at home — including picking up the phone, via [VoIP software](https://www.abajournal.com/columns/article/manage-your-firms-phone-system-from-anywhere-with-voip).  And, if you need to utilize a traditional office, hoteling (sharing office space with your coworkers, on a schedule) and coworking spaces allow you that option.

Trope 9: The Need for Speed

Lawyers are always answering to someone: bosses, clients, the corporations they work for. It never ends. 

And, in the modern world, the expectation is always to get things done faster. 

In the pre-Internet Age, attorneys could [fiddle around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW4kDEYR4Gk), charging by the hour, and racking up the minutes, with little complaint from clients and supervisors. But, those same clients and supervisors are now aware that efficiency is the name of the game. And, it seems like, in movies and TV shows, people are always complaining about how their lawyers are not working fast enough.

Exemplary Scene: [Sometimes, you just feel like a monkey chained to a typewriter, trying to compose “A Tale of Two Cities,” while Mr. Burns yells at you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loMEF18Ir4s).  ([Excellent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le6FwBypMrA).)

The Modern, LegalTech Solution: Well, it turns out that there is a reason why people are aggressive about this stuff. 

That’s because it is easier to be efficient using modern technology.  You’ve just got to, you know: actually use it. 

Now, putting down a full recitation of all the time-saving legal tech tools that have released over the last 20 years or so would extend past any reasonable word count, but perhaps the most immediate efficiency upgrade any law firm can make is the adoption of document assembly software, which can cut down the time you spend building documents from scratch, in dramatic fashion. 

[But, you don’t have to take my word for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIKAsGC1Iy8) . . .  (Actually, you should.  Just take my word for it.)

Trope 10: Dewey Need a Decimal System?

Back in the day, when movie lawyers needed to research a topic, it was straight to the law library they went! 

That venerable old building, with impressive columns and wooden shelving, as far as the eye could see, was the bastion of all legal knowledge. 

Now, those images are mostly used in graphics for law firm logos, and it is the rare attorney who stumbles into a law library these days — at least on purpose. 

But, as you might have guessed, there are lots of 20th Century movies, where attorneys are hitting the research trails hard, and in-person.

Exemplary Scene: In the movie “[Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_(film)),” [both Tom Hanks and his lawyer, Denzel Washington, go to the law library to research together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkpHalgTqpw). (That’s kind of weird, honestly.)  And, the law librarian is kind of a jerk — though, that does further the plot of the film.

The Modern, LegalTech Solution: Even when I was in law school (2000-03), we were moving away from books for research. 

So if middle-aged lawyers like me are out here having cracked open maybe three or four legal research tomes in their entire legal careers, that probably means that the majority of attorneys have been online researching for a not insignificant portion of their own careers. 

Now, the good news is that, in my opinion, legal research is probably the software that has taken the most steps toward leveraging artificial intelligence — and, that promises to continue, as AI tools keep advancing, hellbent on destroying the world.

But, hey: At least when that happens, we’ll still have those old paper texts available to rely on.

# Network Now For Success Later
## Business is all about interacting with people, no matter the business you are in.

Today, the art of conversation has changed with the use of technology and our ability to text, instant message, or upload a story to Instagram. The idea of going to an event that requires some level of face-to-face networking is daunting — and a bit of a foreign concept to those of us who interact through our phones more than in person (i.e., us Millennials). It’s truly awkward and uncomfortable to walk up to a stranger and say hi, but to engage in a full conversation with someone more senior than you is scary and pushes us way outside our comfort zone.

Young associates, however, need to embrace the act of networking because the connections you make are the ones that will help you in your career in the long run. While you may feel like you have nothing to add to a conversation so early in your career, consider that the people you are meeting were once where you are now and have a plethora of knowledge they are more than willing to share with you. These new connections you will make are likely to become your mentors and sponsors, future clients or coworkers, and potential collaborators for writing and speaking engagements.

Make New Friends

To start network, begin with baby steps and work within your comfort zone:

- Look within your firm first. Chances are there are partners you don’t regularly interact with or members of other teams that you only smile at in passing. Attend firm functions where you have the opportunity to mingle with people outside of your team and immediate office. Because you work at the same firm, you will have common ground to talk about, which will make starting a conversation easier and ease you into the practice of networking.
- Attend client events. Showing up to events hosted by your clients is a smart business decision. The more you interact with your clients, the more they get to know you and trust you, which will ideally lead to continued work in the future. Take the time to introduce yourself to the other employees and the other guests your client has invited. You are again starting with a bit of common ground that you can talk about since “how long have you worked with XYZ” can be a good icebreaker. If showing up alone to a client event feels too risky, take a buddy with you so you can work the room together.
- Go back to law school for alumni events. Having gone to the same law school or even university for your undergraduate degree is always an easy topic of conversation. You can reminisce about past experiences from your time at that institution. You have shared an experience and that connection will make people more willing to help down the line — as long as you nurture that new contact.
The next step is to branch out and join associations and diversity groups. You don’t have to be in a specific diverse category to go to a diversity event, allies are often welcomed, too. Yes, it will be scary but you just have to go. It’s an interesting way to meet people, and people will want to talk to you because they are curious about your interest in the group or cause and your (possible) connection to that.

How to Navigate a Networking Event

Go into any networking situation with a rough game plan. There is no need to stay the entire time, but plan on staying at least an hour and talking to a set number of people — set yourself a goal. What do you want to get out of this event? Prepare your elevator pitch and have a few questions ready to ask that will start a conversation, whether about work or personal interests, so that you feel fully prepared. Follow these pointers when you arrive:

- Arrive 10–15 minutes after registration time, not too early so people will be there already and you aren’t awkwardly standing around waiting.
- Drop your bag, coat, etc., if possible, so that your hands are free and you can greet people appropriately when you meet them.
- Keep some business cards with you at all times to hand out.
- Dive in. Grab a drink and find somebody else who is on their own and approach them. There will always be people (who are probably as nervous as you) interested in starting a conversation. You have your questions ready, so just ask them! Remember you are all there for the same reason.
After the event, connect with the people you met on LinkedIn and start building a rapport with them. Send them a small note and initiate next steps with them, whether that’s simply staying in touch or engaging them on a project you want to work with them on in the future.

An Eye Toward the Future

At any stage of your career, you never know the direction your career path will take you, so building your connections will be paramount to your success. Having an internal champion in your firm will help you make internal moves into that sexy practice you are dying to join or act as your advocate when partnership comes up. If you decide to go in-house, often your first move will be at mid-level and are often through people you know or lawyers you have worked with on the other side. Or in the event you choose to leave law practice to explore teaching, banking, consulting, or recruiting, a network of people who know you and your work product will be helpful for you in making these types of moves and industry introductions.

Business is all about interacting with people no matter the business you are in. Push out of your comfort zone and start getting to know others in and out of the industry. The benefits will be endless.

# Am Law 100 Firm Announces End To Salary Cuts And Compensation For All Pay Lost
## Exciting news!

You may have noticed that some firms are [doling out cash hand over fist](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) as they thank their associates for a job well done during the pandemic. Amid the excitement over bonuses, associates at other firms are gritting their teeth, still waiting to see if the salary cuts they endured thanks to COVID-19 will go away any time soon. As luck would have it, one Am Law 100 firm just made the decision to end employees’ paycheck pain.

Littler, the largest employment firm in the world, came in 66th place in the 2020 Am Law 100 rankings with $590,038,000 gross revenue in 2019, but that didn’t stop the firm from [slashing salaries across the board](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-slashes-salaries-for-all-with-up-to-50-percent-cuts-for-some/) this past spring thanks to the coronavirus crisis. Back in May, Littler reduced compensation for equity partners and corporate management by 20 percent and cut salaries for highly paid nonequity partners and non-attorney senior-level administrative employees with compensation of more than $300,000 by 15 percent. In June, the firm put all other employees’ pay on a sliding scale chopping block, averaging cuts of 10 percent. Those unlucky enough to be unable to work remotely due to their job responsibilities saw their pay reduced by 50 percent.

Now that almost five months have passed, the firm is not only doing a complete about face on its austerity measures but it will also make employees whole for the money they lost during the height of the pandemic.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Sources tell us that during a pre-recorded town hall meeting, co-managing directors Tom Bender and Jeremy Roth announced that all salary reductions had been fully reversed and that all pay would be restored as of the firm’s September 25 pay period. Littler employees were also told that they’d receive true-up payments by or before October 2 to bring them to the levels they would have been at prior to the pandemic. As for those who had their salaries cut in half, the firm is still “working with” them, and no furloughs or layoffs have been made to date.

Littler thanked all of its employees for their hard work as management [announced](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/09/17/littler-reinstates-pre-pandemic-pay-joining-other-big-le-firms/) the end of the salary cuts:

Despite the many ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19, we are proud of how our team stepped up to help serve our clients, who are navigating the host of complex workplace issues associated with the pandemic. This collaborative spirit is reflective of our firm culture and we thank all of our attorneys and staff for their continued dedication in the toughest of times.

Congratulations to everyone at Littler. We know the cuts may end soon at additional firms, but let’s hope everyone is made whole, too.

# Am Law 50 Firm Completely Reverses Its Pay Cuts, Announces Some Bonus News
## Exciting times at this firm.

As we move closer and closer to the end of 2020, it seems that Biglaw firms are doing one or more of three things: 1) rolling back austerity measures instituted to survive the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic; 2) doling out COVID-19 appreciation bonuses (or refusing to do so); or 3) outsourcing or laying off their staffing roles to improve their operating efficiencies.

Today, we’ve received word that Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner has chosen the first option. After first assuring employees that the firm [would be able to weather the storm](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-biglaw-firms-rolling-out-good-news-for-now/?rf=1) without making associate or staff salary cuts, furloughs or layoffs, Bryan Cave proceeded to [cut salaries for all employees](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-50-bclp-salary-cuts/) making over $40,000 by 15 percent, conduct [associate and staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/am-law-50-firm-to-lay-off-lawyers-and-staff-close-office/), and even [close an office](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/am-law-50-firm-to-lay-off-lawyers-and-staff-close-office/). On the bright side, after laying out the bad news, BCLP decided to [reduce its pay cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/biglaw-firms-do-an-about-face-on-pay-cuts/) to 7.5 percent, and now, the firm will be completely rolling back those compensation cuts. Here’s an excerpt from a memo that co-chairs [Steve Baumer](https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/people/steven-m-baumer.html) and [Lisa Mayhew](https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/people/lisa-mayhew.html) sent out yesterday:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Sources say that during the video conference, it was announced that they’d be “getting back a lot of the salary withheld” by the firm during the height of the pandemic. It’s also worth noting that Bryan Cave plans to fully fund its 2020 bonuses (and there’s of no mention of special fall bonuses, so we assume that’s completely off the table).

Congratulations to everyone at the firm. Let’s hope more firms are able to announce good news like this in the future.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Bill McGinley, Donald Trump wants YOU! (Photo by Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images)

In the wake of the [controversy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/will-jones-day-drop-donald-trump-as-a-client/) over [Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/jones-day/)‘s work on behalf of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, I wondered if JD partner Don McGahn, Trump’s lead lawyer, might [break off to start his own boutique](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/will-jones-day-drop-donald-trump-as-a-client/). That would let McGahn continue the [family tradition](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-closer-look-at-don-mcgahn-and-jones-days-work-for-donald-trump/) of repping the Donald while sparing Jones Day some headache.

But it seems like Jones Day, rather than encouraging McGahn to take his talents elsewhere, is adding more lawyers to Team Trump. Per [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/donald-trump-republican-delegates-222116):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Donald Trump has made another new significant hire as he prepares for the possibility of a contested convention, bringing [William McGinley](http://www.jonesday.com/wmcginley/), a prominent Republican political attorney and a veteran of past delegate battles, into his campaign.

McGinley is expected to advise the Trump campaign on delegate selection battles in the upcoming states and on possible challenges to the credentials of delegates to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, according to people familiar with the hiring.

Bill McGinley is especially well-equipped to help Donald Trump navigate the GOP convention thicket. As noted by Politico, in 2012 McGinley served as [counsel to the convention’s rules committee](http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/2016/04/06/2012.pdf), so he knows the ins and outs of the complex party rules. He also previously served as deputy counsel to the RNC, counsel to the RNC’s Standing Committee on Rules, and general counsel to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

For all of Trump’s ranting against the Establishment, his legal team is as Establishment as it gets. But I suppose that’s consistent with Trump’s use of the bankruptcy or campaign finance laws: sometimes you have to use the system to beat the system.

Firms are being much stricter about attendance and tying it to bonuses and retention, because they can now. A year ago, they couldn’t.

— [Andrew Detherage](https://btlaw.com/people/andrew-detherage), managing partner of Barnes & Thornburg, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/14/even-with-lawyers-back-in-the-office-law-firms-still-havent-reached-the-new-normal/) on how Biglaw firms may be leveraging their office return policies against their associates’ bonuses. Detherage went on to explain that while his firm doesn’t have a specific number of office days in mind for associates, “[We] expect lawyers to work in-person and be engaged regularly. And we’ve allowed some flexibility there, but also really encouraged our people to come back.”

# Leaving People In A State Of Suspense

The corporate computer system gets hacked. Twenty thousand people around the world get thrown out of the network. Those 20,000 people sit at their desks, cursing their computers and their information technology departments:  “Why can’t those idiots ever make anything work?”

What’s the proper response from the IT department?

- Say nothing to the 20,000 employees, but work conscientiously to fix the hack.
- Send everyone a text message: “The system has been hacked. There’s no problem with your personal computer. You will be unable to access the system until we fix the problem. We’re working on this issue, and we’ll let you know when the system is fixed.”

The difference is between leaving 20,000 people wasting hours of their time trying to get back into the network, while cursing your IT department and the horse it rode it on, and everyone understanding the situation and staying calm while the IT department tries to fix the problem.

You ask your accountant to get an extension to file your income tax returns. The date for requesting the extension approaches. You send reminder emails; the accountant says nothing. The date for filing the extension passes; the accountant says nothing. Two weeks later, in response to your fourth email, the accountant says: “Oh, yes. We filed your request for an extension on the day it was due.”

That solves the problem of getting the extension. But it doesn’t solve the problem of having hired a moron for an accountant.

Don’t leave people in suspense!

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
If you’re supposed to be doing something, tell people that you’re doing it, so your audience doesn’t curse you and assume the worst.

You’re an associate at a law firm. The brief is due on Friday. The partner asks for a draft by Monday. You don’t have the draft ready. What’s the right thing to do?

- Let your Monday deadline come and go, without saying a word to the partner.  You’ll deliver the draft soon enough.
- Send a note to the partner on Monday afternoon: “I’m terribly sorry. Another emergency project interfered with my drafting of your brief. I’ll deliver the brief to you at the start of business on Tuesday.”
The first option leaves the partner cursing you: “Most associates are irresponsible. Therefore, this particular associate is irresponsible. The associate probably hasn’t even started writing the brief, and it’s due on Friday. Why am I doomed to work with these idiots?”

The second option keeps people calm: “I’m disappointed that I didn’t get the brief at the assigned time. But this associate, unlike all of the other associates at this place, is working on the brief, keeping me informed, and may actually get me the brief on Tuesday morning. That’s a reasonable alternative to not delivering the brief at the assigned time.”

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Why leave people in suspense?

When something is due at a certain time, deliver the work product at the assigned time. If you can’t, then explain why the work product has been delayed.

Leaving people in suspense is just stupid: The person who’s expecting the work product hasn’t forgotten about it. That person is cursing you until the work product arrives. Why allow that to happen? Don’t leave people in suspense: Alert them to the problem, and tell them when it will be fixed.

That’s a better (and far less common) solution.  Trust me.

# Not Content With Staff Furloughs, Am Law 100 Firm Follows Up With Across-The-Board Pay Cuts

The COVID-19 austerity measures continue in Biglaw. And even firms that were initially proactive about cost-cutting are finding themselves making additional cuts. Like Blank Rome.

The Am Law 100 firm [previously confirmed to Above the Law ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-am-law-100-covid-19-furloughs-continue/?rf=1) that they’d “furloughed a small number of support staff” in response to the economic upheaval surrounding the global pandemic. Now tipsters report to Above the Law that there are also pay cuts for all remaining employees.

The firm has instituted a “temporary 15% compensation reduction” and unlike the furloughs, which were limited to staff, the salary hit impacts everyone as the firm’s statement reflects “[the pay cuts are] to be shared equally by our partners, associates, counsel, professional staff and assistants.” Here’s the firm’s full comments on the reduction in pay:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
We have implemented certain measures across our firm to take a cautious and financially disciplined approach to the Covid-19 pandemic. We are instituting a temporary 15% compensation reduction throughout the entire law firm to be shared equally by our partners, associates, counsel, professional staff and assistants, and have temporarily furloughed a small number of staff, along with other operational expense-reduction measures. As always, our priority remains supporting our clients, colleagues and communities in which we live and work throughout this difficult time. In that regard, we will continue to focus significant efforts on supporting pro bono clients impacted by the Coronavirus and we will be maintaining our charitable commitments in order to assist those most in need during these uncertain times.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

# The State Of Biglaw: 3 Thoughts From David Lat
## We are only at the beginning of this retrenchment.

Greetings, it’s David Lat here. As many of you know, and as I mentioned here [last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/coronavirus-and-me-david-lat-covid-19-journal/), I recently engaged in a weeks-long battle with the novel coronavirus. I was hospitalized for 17 days, including about a week in critical condition in the ICU, when I was hooked up to a ventilator. But I’m happy to report that I made it through — thanks in no small part to the support of the Above the Law community — and I’m now recovering comfortably at home (or actually my parents’ home in suburban New Jersey, which is a bit more spacious than my Manhattan apartment).

I am (slowly) getting back into the saddle as both a legal recruiter and a legal journalist, currently working through a large backlog of communications. Apologies if I owe you a message. If I do, please feel free to try me again; I’m now more on top of my correspondence than I was while in the hospital.

During the few weeks that I have been away, Biglaw has been transformed. Law firms have implemented [many different measures](https://www.law.com/2020/04/14/pay-cuts-layoffs-and-more-how-law-firms-are-managing-the-pandemic/) to deal with the economic fallout of COVID-19, including delaying or reducing partnership draws, reducing salaries of associates and staff, furloughing associates and staff, or postponing non-essential spending.

Making predictions is a dangerous business. Who would have guessed, two months ago, that we would be where we are today? But with your indulgence, I will offer a few… observations about the current state of Biglaw. (To the extent that these are predictions, please take them with a veritable shaker of salt.)

1. Law firms are responding very intelligently to the current crisis.

As I said in recent interviews with [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/04/10/take-heart-be-strong-david-lat-on-how-covid-19-has-changed-his-life-and-the-legal-profession/) and [Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/david-lat-recovers-returns-to-an-industry-upended-by-contagion), I believe that law firms are doing a good job in responding to the downturn — especially compared to how they handled the Great Recession.

I had a front seat to how Biglaw responded to the Great Recession, given Above the Law’s close coverage of events in Biglaw during that time. Back then, firms basically had one tool — layoffs — and they used it indiscriminately.

This time around, law firms are being more creative — and more fair. They are using a variety of measures to economize, and some of these measures, such as delaying or reducing partnership draws, hit partners as well as associates and staff. In other words, law firms are spreading the pain, instead of inflicting it upon the people least able to bear it.

2. We are only at the beginning of this retrenchment.

If you look at the list of [law firms that have adopted cost-cutting measures](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/14/pay-cuts-layoffs-and-more-how-law-firms-are-managing-the-pandemic/?kw=Pay%20Cuts%2C%20Layoffs%2C%20and%20More:%20How%20Law%20Firms%20Are%20Managing%20the%20Pandemic&utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_campaign=afternoonupdate&utm_content=20200415&utm_term=tal), you’ll be struck by how many firms are not on the list. Compare this to the Great Recession, where it seemed that practically every firm, including some of the most prestigious and profitable, did something (e.g., layoffs, delaying start dates, etc.).

But the list of firms cutting costs in the current crisis grows every day and every week. So it’s not particularly bold of me to predict that it will continue to grow, especially as the economic downturn continues. The lockdown or stay-at-home orders in many jurisdictions will likely remain in place for quite some time, which means that the economic damage these cause will continue for some time too. As clients suffer, their law firms will suffer along with them.

3. Associate hiring has slowed down, but partner hiring will continue.

Many law firms have put associate hiring on hold — which is not surprising, considering that work is slowing down in many practice areas. And of course firms that are laying off or furloughing associates, or thinking about layoffs or furloughs, generally aren’t going to be eager consumers of lateral talent.

But as in the last recession, partner hiring continues. This makes sense: as the pie shrinks, the way firms can maintain or grow revenue is by getting a bigger share of the smaller pie. And the way to do that is to hire lateral partners with big books of business.

So here at Lateral Link, we still have many partner candidates interviewing with firms (using tools like Zoom and Skype). Closing deals can be tricky right now — firms generally want a face-to-face meeting before bringing aboard a new partner, and those can be hard to set up right now — but activity is taking place.

But who knows if this will continue? The bottom line right now: the only certain thing is uncertainty. We are experiencing an unprecedented social and economic disruption, whose consequences will not be fully understood for quite some time.

To help lawyers and legal employers navigate this challenging environment, Lateral Link is launching our [COVID-19 Bridge Program](https://brojure.com/laterallinksako/lateral-link-s-covid-19-bridge-program/). The Bridge Program will connect lawyers who are seeking work with employers who are seeking temporary assistance — and, as an inducement to encourage employers to work with us, we are offering our attorneys at no cost for two weeks (newly-placed attorneys only).

If you are an attorney interested in participating, please [register with us](https://app.laterallink.com/register), and we will email you with additional details. If you are an employer interested in hiring top temporary talent, please contact my colleagues [Jaclyn Genchi](https://www.laterallink.com/team/jaclyn-genchi/) and [Carolyn Brenner](https://www.laterallink.com/team/carolyn-brenner/). If you are an employer interested in hiring document review attorneys, please contact my colleague [Craig Brown](https://www.laterallink.com/team/craig-brown/).

The Bridge Program also includes, for employers, outplacement services for their furloughed or laid-off lawyers — and the first 20 hours of counseling are free. If you are an employer interested in retaining us to provide outplacement services for your lawyers, please contact my colleague [Amy Savage](https://www.laterallink.com/team/amy-savage).

These are difficult and trying times. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me or to any of my [colleagues at Lateral Link](https://www.laterallink.com/team/) for help. We will get through this — together.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I talked to one guy who heads a big New York firm, who said ‘We just have to invest in the people [we already have], or at least show them a career path, or we’re gonna lose them.

— Brad Hildebrandt, chair of Hildebrandt Consulting and one of the authors of the 2024 Client Advisory from Hildebrandt Consulting and Citi’s Global Wealth at Work Law Firm Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/12/07/staggering-jump-in-law-firms-planning-to-expand-nonequity-partner-ranks/) on one of the reasons Biglaw firms are expanding their nonequity partner ranks. The survey notes that 83% of Biglaw firms expect to increase the size of their income partner roles in the next two years, a “staggering jump” from the 68% projected growth reported last year.

The Sunday real estate section of the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/realestate/industrial-elegance-in-soho.html?&&&&&&module=Slide&region=SlideShowTopBar&version=SlideCard-1&action=Click&contentCollection=Real%20Estate&slideshowTitle=Exclusive%20%7C%2082%20Greene%20Street&currentSlide=1&entrySlide=1&pgtype=imageslideshow) recently covered the fabulous Soho loft of just such a couple, describing the apartment as follows:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Susan Davidson, the chief executive of the Zac Posen fashion house, remembers seeing great potential in the raw, cavernous space offered for sale in a co-op conversion at 82 Greene Street in the late 1980s….

Today the impeccably revamped loft, now a triplex of about 3,200 square feet, can easily be described as rustic chic, retaining some of its early-1870s architectural detail alongside modern conveniences. Ms. Davidson and her current husband, Allen Miller, a corporate lawyer, spent around $4 million to painstakingly transform the space with the help of the designer Todd Klein, and contracted Tyler Horsley to landscape three terraces totaling around 1,100 square feet with plants, flowers and fruit-bearing trees.


J. Allen Miller

Referring to J. Allen Miller as “a corporate lawyer” is, well, like calling Zac Posen “a designer.” Miller is a very high-profile and successful lawyer, currently serving as [head of the corporate department](http://www.chadbourne.com/amiller) at Chadbourne & Parke, where he has worked on multiple billion-dollar deals over the years.

So Allen Miller is a senior partner at an elite law firm, and Susan Davidson is the CEO of a fashion house. Dropping $4 million on the apartment renovation shouldn’t have been a huge problem (and note that they — or rather she, along with her former husband — bought the apartment for less than $460,000, way back in the 1980s).

Why are they putting up their lovingly renovated apartment up for sale? Like [former Skadden partner David Wolin](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-partner-goes-out-in-blaze-of-glory-with-musical-departure-video/), who traded client whines for making wines, Allen Miller has had enough of city life:

[T]he couple now plan to move to an even older home — a late-1830s house on 30 acres in the Hudson Valley, where entire fruit orchards can be harvested. They are putting the loft, unit No. 5F, just off Spring Street, up for sale. The asking price is $11.75 million, according to Rebecca Edwardson and Bonnie Chajet of Warburg Realty, who are listing the apartment.

What does one get for almost $12 million? Let’s have a look….

# Am Law 100 News: Elite New York Dominate In Profits And Revenue

While we await the full [unveiling of the Am Law 100 tomorrow](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/03/30/am-law-100-trends-insights-stories-of-big-law-in-2018/), we’re getting teased with insights from the publication’s annual cavalcade of Biglaw data confirming what we’ve been saying for some time now — the [Biglaw rich are getting richer](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/law-firms-finished-2017-better-than-2016-and-everythings-still-malaise/) far faster than anyone else.

New York Law Journal’s Christine Simmons [has the lowdown](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/04/23/new-yorks-elite-law-firms-still-lead-the-pack-on-profits-revenue/) on a sample of 17 elite Biglaw firms that ALM uses as a benchmark when looking at the New York market. Unsurprisingly, they had a pretty good year:

All 17 firms, except Cravath Swaine & Moore, Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, posted increases in revenue last year, according to ALM reporting.

More than half of the 17 firms saw revenue growth of 5 percent or more, and three saw their revenue soar by more than 10 percent: Debevoise & Plimpton, with a gain of 11.8 percent to $822 million; Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, rising 14 percent to $634.9 million; and Willkie Farr & Gallagher, leaping up 11.7 percent to $772 million.

Similarly, all 17 firms saw their profits per equity partner increase, except three: Cleary, Cravath and Davis Polk & Wardwell.

That solidly puts the elite New York firms ahead of the industry as a whole. Indeed, as the Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group numbers demonstrate quarter after quarter, the cream of the crop firms are carrying the industry numbers as a whole right now — with some help from boutiques — with the next tier of firms barely treading water in the face of low demand.

Analysts from both Citi and Wells Fargo Private Bank’s Legal Specialty Group pointed to transactional work, including private equity and mergers and acquisitions, driving firms’ growth.

“For many of these firms that are doing the big transitional work … there’s a lot of elasticity to the rates,” said Joe Mendola of Wells Fargo. Litigation “has continued to be somewhat of a struggle,” he said.

Well, that’s the sign of a growing economy. Don’t worry, when the bottom falls out next year there will be plenty of people eager to sue. And that’s not counting all the bankruptcy litigation we’ll be able to enjoy!

The moral, as always, is that it’s good to be king. In an age of frugality, clients can look to leaner and cheaper alternatives for almost all of their legal work, especially with technology giving boutiques firepower on par with the old factory-system firms. The massive overhead of a Biglaw firm requires big ticket rates, and the only way to pay for that system these days is to back it up with a level of prestige so high that clients can justify the cost to themselves and their superiors.

Cravath can pull that off. Not everyone else can. So let’s not be surprised when the full Am Law 200 list comes out that the gap between the Am Law 50 and the rest of the pack has grown precipitously.

Again.

# Biglaw Partner Killed His Wife, Allegedly Because Of 'Black Lives Matter'
## Lawyer shoots his wife. His own irrational fears to blame?

[Claud “Tex” McIver](https://www.fisherphillips.com/attorneys-cmciver) shot his 63-year-old wife in the back last week, [resulting in her death](http://www.people.com/article/claude-tex-mciver-accidentally-shot-wife-diane-in-car) — of this there is no argument. The Atlanta-based partner of labor and employment giant Fisher & Phillips says his .38 snub-nose went off accidentally after the car both were riding in hit a speed bump. The resulting wound — a gunshot to his wife’s back — resulted in her death after hours of surgery attempted to save her life.

We grieve for Diane McIver. And Tex McIver too, who a family spokesman describes, understandably, as traumatized by an accident that took the life of his wife. Yet we are compelled to ask, whenever someone is shot and killed in America, how did this senseless death take place? Tex McIver’s gun was out and ready to fire while riding in a moving car because, at least according to sources close to Tex McIver speaking to the [Atlanta Journal-Constitution](http://www.ajc.com/news/local/atlanta-attorney-says-gun-his-lap-went-off-striking-his-wife/1pA2ZtJkQI94xnIr9J0zcL/)… of Black Lives Matter?

McIver says he and his wife were being driven home by Diane’s best friend when their Ford Explorer was approached by several individuals during a week in which there were many Black Lives Matter protests in the area, according to Bill Crane, a McIver family friend, who spoke to the The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Friday.

Yes, according to this logic, those unruly ragamuffins who think police brutality should be subject to basic [standards of accountability](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/the-ludicrous-and-tragic-relationship-of-police-prosecutors-and-the-law/) had spoken out earlier in the week in the general area where he was and this was such a concern that McIver pulled out a loaded firearm.

Per [Tex McIver’s spokesman](http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/prominent-attorney-says-wifes-shooting-death-was-a-terrible-accident/452215841):

As they came close to the intersection of Peachtree and Pine, near the homeless shelter, the spokesman says they were approached by several individuals and they were afraid they were going to get carjacked so the McIvers retrieved a pistol out of the center console. The gun was still wrapped in a Publix grocery bag.

A Publix grocery bag.

And, yes, even if we were to consider McIver an activist lawyer who donated tremendous sums to [candidates endorsed by the NRA](http://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.php?name=Claud+McIver&cycle=All&sort=R&state=GA&zip=&employ=&cand=&submit=Submit), if there’s any lawyer — any person — who should recognize and respect the awesome power of a firearm, one would assume it would be someone on the ABA Standing Committee on Gun Violence, regardless of personal politics.

Yet, he was rolling around Atlanta with a loaded firearm, wrapped in a frigging grocery bag, in his lap while falling asleep. Oh, yeah, it turned out those black people didn’t carjack them (quelle surprise!), so McIver’s spokesman-relayed story is that he then fell asleep in the backseat with the gun in his lap. All this, according to this story, because protesters evoked apprehension.

That’s the broader tragedy here. This is how racism doesn’t just hurt its intended victims, but everyone, albeit in vastly disparate ways (this is no “All Lives Matter” screed… there’s no equivalency drawn here). The irrational fear and stereotyping that could lead someone to pull a firearm because of “Black Lives Matter” only feeds a cycle of disturbing thoughts and actions that end in tragedy. It doesn’t even have to be direct. If someone gets freaked out by “carjacking” whenever they hear about civil rights protesters or drive past a homeless shelter, even if they never had a gun (or ever lent their money to advocating for lax laws to let more jumpy, unprofessional white folks arm themselves with weapons they don’t understand), it’s this kind of fear-mongering that only ruins another generation of kids soaking up these retrograde prejudices. That trans-generational bulldink is what keeps America turning a blind eye when a black kid gets gunned down for owning a toy gun while suburban kids play G.I. Joe or whatever the f**k equivalent we have now.

Probably something involving PokéNinja Shopkins.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This is your legacy, 20-Teens America. It’s not going to be a black president, or a woman president, or even an orange president. It’s going to be the persistent kernel of Americans who keep embracing this irrational, perhaps even unconscious, fear. And this is a bipartisan call — because every self-satisfied liberal decrying Trump’s overtly racist claptrap should take a real serious look at how happy they really should be with Hillary “[superpredator](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ronda-lee/hillarys-superpredator-comment_b_9655052.html)” Clinton. Because you don’t get to stoke the flames of racial terror to win over white suburbanites and claim the resulting monster isn’t your shared responsibility.

America needs to be a lot more somber about where it actually is, instead of patting itself on the back about where it isn’t… yet.

I’d be remiss to end this story without noting that McIver has not been arrested, though law enforcement claims the incident is still under investigation. One wonders if the black protesters who McIver’s friends say he claims prompted this incident would have gotten the same benefit of the doubt as a responsible gun owner beset by a freak accident if they showed up at the emergency room having shot a spouse in the back because they were scared.

I’m guessing not.

# An Earlier Bonus Announcement For This Firm Paying Most Associates Under Market
## Usually associates have to wait until March to learn that they're probably not getting Cravath bonuses.

Well, you’ve got to give Sheppard Mullin credit this year for not dragging out their bonuses until March. [Historically](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/firm-disappoints-associates-with-bonus-announcement-again/), the firm awards bonuses based on work through September 30 and then announces bonuses in March, getting associates both coming and going. But this year we’ve been told that they’ve announced them already based upon the October 2016-September 2017 period.

They’re still low, but at least they’re out.

Just like last year, Sheppard Mullin is matching Cravath… for those who bill more than 2200 hours.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Class	2200+
2015-16	$15,000
2014	$25,000
2013	$50,000
2012	$65,000
2011	$80,000
2010	$90,000
2009	$100,000
For those billing 1950-2099 hours, first-year bonuses start at a mere $9,000 and those billing 2100-2199 have their bonus scale start at $12,000. On the other hand, associates billing 2400+ see a little bump over the Cravath scale, earning $2250 more for first-years and $15K more for the most senior attorneys.

We’ve not gotten much commentary from associates yet, but given that Sheppard Mullin is following the same scale as last year, one of last year’s comments probably still reflects the majority of the firm’s lawyers:

Basically, you’ve got to hit 2200 to get a market bonus (i.e., work about a month more than associates at peer firms to get market – #lame).

# Struggling Firm May Be Canceling Its Summer Program
## Which law firm may be pulling the plug on its summer associate program?

‘I might not have a job?!’

It’s mid April, and law students are waiting for their semesters to end so they can begin their summer associate programs. At most law firms, these programs are a whirlwind of free lunches, fun events, interesting work, and perhaps most important of all, fat paychecks. But what would happen if a firm could no longer afford luxuries like summer associates? That seems to be what’s happening at [Kenyon & Kenyon](http://www.kenyon.com/), a former IP giant that has lost a fair share of partners in recent months.

Earlier this year, we’d wondered [if the firm would survive 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/will-this-law-firm-survive-2016/). At the time, managing partner [Edward Colbert](http://www.kenyon.com/Our-People/C/ColbertEdward.aspx) seemed optimistic about the firm’s prospects for the year ahead. Four months later, we’ve heard word that the firm may be canceling its summer program, which certainly seems to be a harbinger of doom. Yikes.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As you may recall, canceling summer programs was a movement back in 2009, when Biglaw firms were suffering through the Great Recession. Since those dark days, however, killing off summer programs has been rare, done by firms only in exceptional circumstances (e.g., Dewey & LeBoeuf, which [officially pulled the plug on its summer program](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/04/we-dont-have-any-summer-associates-dewey-and-additional-info-about-a-possible-criminal-probe/) just days before advising partners to seek employment elsewhere).

We’ve heard from several tipsters that Kenyon has “rescinded” its offers to summer associates and canceled the program in its entirety, but the firm contests that categorization. A firm spokesperson told us the following information:

This is not the case. While some major firms have cancelled their summer associate programs in the past, we have not officially cancelled our summer associate program, but are not guaranteeing that there will be a summer program this year. We are in a transitional period and we cannot say with any certainty there will be a summer program at this time.

A source had this to say of Kenyon’s wishy-washy summer program: “[C]onsidering summer associates will be starting in a matter of weeks, this seems in very bad form. It seems like a bad move for future recruitment efforts too, if they are known as the firm who rescinded summer offers a week before finals.”

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
We sought a definitive answer about these would-be summer associates’ offers. When asked whether the firm had, in fact, rescinded offers, a firm representative said “[t]he offers have not be rescinded, but we cannot guarantee there will be a summer associate program this year.” This doesn’t seem fair to the firm’s summer associates, at all.

Why keep summer associates in limbo? Don’t they deserve to know whether they’re going to be employed in just a few short months? After another email was exchanged, we received this response from a firm spokesperson:

We have explained to the summer associates that we cannot guarantee them a summer associate position at this time. We told them we understand that they may feel the need to explore other opportunities.

Note to prospective summer associates at Kenyon & Kenyon: Keep your options open — that’s what the firm seems to be doing.

When it comes to running transactions, legal teams still cling to slow, expensive, and administratively heavy manual tasks.

This reality persists despite the rapidly increasing use of technology to streamline countless legal tasks in other areas.

Clients are demanding more from their firms. And transactional lawyers would benefit from adapting to the present.

In this free webinar hosted by legal tech journalist Bob Ambrogi, our expert panel will explore how the traditionally manual, labor-intensive, error-prone process of managing legal transactions can be transformed.

With the right setup, legal teams — whether working in the office or remotely — can manage their transactions more securely, efficiently, and collaboratively, while boosting profits and amazing their clients.

# Biglaw Back To Work: When Will Your Law Firm Reopen?
## Lawyers have been working from home for a while thanks to COVID-19, but with a vaccine available, that may soon change.

The novel coronavirus continues its rapid spread across the country, with cases increasing exponentially by the day. It seems that each week, the U.S. sets a record COVID-19 death toll, breaking records set just the week before. Hospitals are edging ever closer to being overrun and state mask mandates are spreading almost as quickly as the virus itself. To say that things do not look good would be an understatement.

Thankfully, two vaccines have been approved for emergency use by the FDA, and at this rate, these shots can’t be administered soon enough. With hopes pinned high on the vaccine’s potential to put an end to the pandemic, it got us wondering what Biglaw firms intended to do. While some firms never shut down, most were quick to adopt policies that pushed their attorneys and staff into virtual workspaces, with many committing to keep business online until at least the end of 2020.

With vaccines on the horizon, just how quickly will law firms step away from remote work and formally reopen their offices? Will you be expected to return to work?

Help us help you. Please click the button below to take our survey on your firm’s plans during this unprecedented time. We’ll compile the data and let you compare and contrast between firms. As always, you will be kept completely anonymous. Thanks!

# MoFo's Alleged 'Skullduggery'
## The firm denies the allegations in the suit.

I love a good turn of phrase. So when a lawsuit, filed against a major Biglaw firm, alleges “History teaches that corporate corruption, financial fraud, and economic skullduggery cannot be perpetrated without the willful conniving of lawyers” and add to the mix a contentious divorce of high-powered people, well, it’s going to catch my attention.

Anyway, Scott Hassan, an entrepreneur and unofficial “third founder” of Google, and his wife, Allison Huynh, are getting a divorce, which Huynh filed for in 2015. Morrison & Foerster represented Hassan in various dealings as well as the couple’s joint assets. According to the complaint, MoFo partner [Paul “Chip” Lion](https://www.mofo.com/people/paul-chip-lion.html) continued to represent Hassan and the couple’s joint ventures after a judge disqualified the firm from advising Hassan in the divorce proceeding. As Law.com reports, Huynh alleges there was an effort by Hassan to “cheat[] his spouse out of her rightful share of community property.”

Huynh says the firm “orchestrated a fire-sale” of the assets of robotics company Suitable Technologies, which she has a half interest in, according to the complaint. She alleges the deal was an effort to score a personal tax benefit of more than $90 million for Hassan.

“Although Plaintiff was successful in thwarting the sale—the Court of Chancery found that the sales process ‘inspire[d]’ concern, was driven by Hassan’s desire to obtain a personal tax benefit, and that ‘there’s good reason to believe that Suitable Technologies’ asset value approximates or even exceeds $100 million—she incurred substantial professional fees in doing so,” Huynh’s attorneys write. “These fees, which she was unable to recover in the dissolution action, total more than $1.1 million.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And the complaint takes a mighty swing at the Biglaw firm, suing Lion and MoFo for breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage:

“Morrison & Foerster is a sophisticated, international law firm and a prominent presence in the Silicon Valley legal community,” the lawsuit alleges. “Lion has been practicing in the field for nearly 40 years. They should know better. The only deterrent for such reprehensible betrayal of a client is a significant award of compensatory and punitive damages.”

A representative for MoFo denied the allegations: “We deny all the allegations made by the Plaintiff against the Firm and its representatives and we will address them in the proper forum.”

# Ex-Attorney At Top 10 Biglaw Firm Charged With Insider Trading
## He allegedly used the firm's confidential client information to make his illegal trades.

Trading on insider information never, ever ends well for anyone — especially if you’re an attorney at a Biglaw firm.

Romero Cabral Da Costa Neto, 33, of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, started working as a visiting attorney at Gibson Dunn in September 2022. Costa stands accused of accessing confidential client information from within Gibson Dunn’s internal filing system to make trades ahead of a major pharmaceutical M&A deal. Earlier this week, he was arrested in Washington, D.C., and charged with insider trading. The [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2023/08/23/ex-attorney-at-gibson-dunn-charged-with-insider-trading/) has the details:

During Costa’s one-year employment as a visiting attorney, he allegedly accessed confidential information about the law firm’s work on biopharmaceutical company Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB’s acquisition of CTI BioPharma Corp (CTIC), according to the SEC complaint. According to a press release, Gibson Dunn served as legal counsel to CTIC in the transaction.

The SEC complaint alleges that on the day before the deal was publicly announced, May 9, 2023, Costa purchased over 10,000 shares of CTIC, when he then reportedly sold for a profit of more than $42,000. Costa was not assigned to the deal for the firm, per the SEC.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But that’s not all: according to the [SEC complaint](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-158), Costa accessed other nonpublic deal information from within Gibson Dunn’s document management system, and allegedly traded on that information too. Nicholas P. Grippo, Regional Director of the SEC’s Philadelphia Regional Office, offered this [statement](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-158):

“As alleged in our complaint, Costa violated his duties to the law firm and its clients when he abused his position to enrich himself. Lawyers often have access to sensitive and confidential information about their law firms’ public company clients. When lawyers abuse that access, as Costa allegedly did here, we will promptly take action to hold them accountable. In this case, thanks to the quick work of the SEC’s staff, we were able to act within months of Costa’s alleged insider trading to ensure that he will be held accountable.”

As noted by the NLJ, Gibson Dunn is cooperating with authorities. “We are cooperating with authorities and have terminated our relationship with the individual, who was an international visiting attorney from another law firm,” a firm spokesperson said.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# The Lean Law Firm
## How to grow your firm by cultivating a culture of learning.

As most of us wind down the year and start preparing to face 2023, law firm leadership teams are contemplating how to stay strong and relevant in the coming uncertain economic times. Past performance is famously not a guarantee of future results, and most businesses ultimately fall flat or flame out entirely given enough time.

Consider the fact that of the companies listed on the Fortune 500 in 1955, [at least 87% no longer exist today](https://www.joplinglobe.com/news/business/john-newby-dont-resist-change-use-it-to-your-advantage/article_a249f02e-0316-530a-8447-eceab2ef073f.html). The vast majority of the world’s biggest movers and shakers at a time still in living memory just aren’t around anymore, and the rate of change and turnover in the business world is only going to continue to increase. Simply treading water in the marketplace is hard, and treading water isn’t good enough. As William S. Burroughs said, “When you stop growing, you start dying.”

Part of the problem, paradoxically, is that a firm’s success can sow the seeds of its own failure. As businesses succeed, their leadership teams are (hopefully) acutely aware of the decisions, strategies, and actions that got them to where they are. So when the time comes to keep succeeding and keep growing, leadership teams are prone to looking at their old strategies and simply double down on the plan that’s already proven it can work. It’s a totally understandable and rational thought process, but it’s also one that can result in ossified business plans that aren’t prepared to adjust to changing economics, trends, and competition.

How Success Works

As I’ve mentioned before, I’ve spent much of the past two years studying entrepreneurship through a master’s program at the University of Cambridge Business School, with the goal of better understanding how the world’s most successful enterprises find lasting, durable success, and how to apply those lessons to running the firm I help manage. As part of my thesis, I interviewed 25 legal heavyweights, including Biglaw managing partners, LegalTech CEOs, academics, and others to learn how established firms can use entrepreneurial strategies to drive innovation, rather than falling into a trap of complacently rehashing past successes.

Going into those interviews, I assumed that great entrepreneurship was driven by wild ideas formulated in stylish team meetings. Informed by the legends of garage-founded startups like Apple and Meta, I was imagining that great entrepreneurial ideas came out of a horde of young hoodie-wearing professionals sitting in a circle of bean bags, excitedly scribbling out concepts on dry-erase boards. It’s an alluring, dynamic concept to build a company around, one centered on rogue geniuses reshaping the world one algorithm at a time.

Reality, as always, turned out to be a lot less sexy. Successful entrepreneurship isn’t a series of blazing bright ideas implemented cleanly. It’s a process, and often it’s a grind. It’s all about identifying looming challenges and opportunities, brainstorming solutions, and then designing controlled, measurable ways to experiment with those solutions. Those experiments will often fail. If you’re lucky, they’ll fail quickly and cheaply. Don’t count on being lucky.

Once the experiment is over, it’s all about figuring out what worked, what didn’t, and what deserves further testing. Then it’s back to experimenting, and analyzing, and experimenting again. The cycle never ends, the work is never done. Today’s work is all about making tomorrow’s work hopefully better.

There are a number of formulations and names for this process. I’m partial to Eric Ries’ book “[The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0670921602/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2CIH7JWMNZUJJ&keywords=lean+startup&qid=1670939598&s=books&sprefix=lean+startup,stripbooks,140&sr=1-1),” where he calls it the Build-Measure-Learn cycle, but you may have read about or experienced the iterative feedback loop concept in any number of contexts. It’s increasingly endemic in the broader business world, even if adoption in the legal space remains, as usual, lagging behind. It’s a proven model for innovation and optimization, but more importantly it’s a way of thinking that can be taught, one that can become baked into a business’ systems and culture. Most law firms don’t employ eccentric rogue geniuses who can reshape an entire industry with their ideas, but all law firms can work positively toward creating a culture of experimentation and iterative refinement.

So Why Do So Few Firms Do It?

Many of the problems with law firms come down to the fact they’re populated by lawyers. The challenge of developing an entrepreneurial culture in a law firm is no different. The Build-Measure-Learn cycle is all about constant change, and lawyers tend to resist change. Trevor Faure’s excellent resource [Smarter Law](https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Law-Transforming-Lawyers-Business/dp/0314843914) goes into depth on this topic, and I won’t quote here his entire “Maleficent Seven” reasons that lawyers resist change, but given our profession is one that is based on precedent, insulated from the full weight of the competitive marketplace, and that has historically done well enough by being reactive rather than proactive, it’s not that surprising that many law firms are allergic to experimentation, especially given the high likelihood that some of those experiments will abjectly fail.

But our industry’s historically reactive mindset doesn’t mean the future has to look the same. Those firms looking to develop that entrepreneurial edge have some strategies at their disposal.

How To Overcome Being Lawyers

First, firm leadership needs to constantly communicate that experimentation and change are crucial to the firm’s continued success. Team meetings need to regularly include surveys of new economic trends, market competitors, and potential disruptions and opportunities. Leadership should make a point of considering structured experiments proposed by anyone in the firm, from the managing partner to the mail room attendant. And leadership needs to commit to the iterative learning model, normalizing the failure inherent in that process. Experiments that don’t pan out as expected still teach us something, informing the next round of experiments that hopefully end more productively.

Second, firm leaders should implement programs designed to reinforce the feedback loop, rather than letting the experiment die on the vine. Next year, for example, Fennemore is launching an R&D incubator known as Fennemore Labs that provides a formal mechanism for partners, associates, and other legal professionals to systematically identify and pursue novel solutions that will position the firm for success. The ideas will be tested, and most will fail. But based on evaluation and measurement, the Fennemore Labs concept ensures that ideas that didn’t work but still have potential will be iterated and tried again. We’re committing resources and time to the basic concept of experimentation, learning, and growth.

Lastly, firm leaders must foster an environment of psychological safety for the above processes to thrive. Lawyers are trained to seek and destroy ideas. We’re taught from our first days in law school how to prove our value by dismantling others’ thoughts. That may arguably work in some legal contexts, but it doesn’t work when ideating and working with coworkers. When it comes to innovation, leaders must learn to scale down how much we praise successful results and begin praising successes in the process. It’s only by creating a positive, collaborative environment where constructive failure is welcomed that we’ll be able to break ourselves of those bad law school habits and open up the floodgates of creativity.

Past performance isn’t an indicator of future results, but today’s performance absolutely is. If you want your firm to have a prosperous 2023 and beyond, embrace the entrepreneurial model. It’s scary, disruptive, and often doesn’t work out as expected. And that’s exactly why your firm needs to do it.

Back in January, Judge Paul Watford of the Ninth Circuit announced that he would be [resigning from the bench](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/watford-resign-court-private-practice/) to return to private practice. The 55-year-old judge would officially call it quits on May 31, and in his resignation letter, he said stepping down was “one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make in my life.”

At the time, the legal community wondered where Watford would land. He’d previously worked at Munger Tolles as a partner, and many speculated that he may be returning to his old stomping grounds. We now know where Watford is working — and it isn’t at Munger.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Earlier today, Wilson Sonsini — a firm that brought in $1,354,000,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 33 in the most recent Am Law 100 — announced that Watford had joined the firm’s litigation practice as a partner. The recently retired judge will work out of the firm’s Los Angeles office, where he’ll focus on appellate and complex commercial disputes.

What does Watford have to say about his move from the bench to Biglaw? Here’s the scoop in a [press release](https://www.wsgr.com/en/insights/former-ninth-circuit-judge-paul-watford-joins-wilson-sonsini-as-a-partner.html) from the firm:

“Throughout my time serving as a Ninth Circuit judge, I had the opportunity to work with amazing people in a collegial and professionally rewarding environment, and to be directly involved in the disposition of interesting and important matters,” said Judge Watford. “In joining Wilson Sonsini, I will be able to continue working with talented lawyers and professionals in a collaborative culture that places high value on diversity and teamwork. I look forward to taking on challenging and engaging matters for the firm’s clients, which include many of the world’s most innovative and dynamic companies.”

Congratulations to Judge Paul Watford on landing at a law firm that he loves, and congratulations to Wilson Sonsini on adding a former federal appellate judge to its roster. Best of luck!

# The Never-Ending Billable Hour: A 106-Year-Old Is Still Working At The Biglaw Firm Where He Started His Career

Time seems to move in reverse warp speed as you review yet another document, write yet another brief, and bill yet another hour. Your days are long and no matter how long you’ve been at your firm, it feels like like you’ve been there forever. One “partner emeritus” quite literally has been working at his firm forever, but he doesn’t seem to mind one bit. In fact, he still loves the time he’s spent at his firm — all 80 years of it.

Meet [Mordecai “Mordie” Rochlin](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/mordecai-rochlin), a tax and estates lawyer at Paul Weiss who retired 35 years ago, but still works at the firm as of counsel. Rochlin, who was born in 1912, is one of the oldest lawyers in New York, and he’s the only man alive who knew all five of the name partners at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Here’s more on this remarkable attorney from the [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/12/19/paul-weiss-partner-who-retired-35-years-ago-still-works-in-office-at-age-106/):

Until he contracted pneumonia at age 102, he worked in his tidy Paul Weiss office on the 32nd floor three or more days a week reading company email, working with his assistant, attending partner lunches, telling stories about the early days and sharing the keys to his longevity.

“I had been taught by a very wise doctor when you start thinking of retiring, get a plan of what you’re going to do when you retire. My mode of retirement was that I would spend four days a week up at my weekend house and then three days practicing law,” he said in a recent interview.

Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp was just a summer associate when Rochlin retired, and has nothing but good things to say about him. “Mordie is a treasure,” said Karp. “He is a repository of the firm’s great history, having worked at the firm for more than 80 years.”

When he’s at the firm, Rochlin says he signs checks, reads memos, and makes a few phone calls, but stays in his office for an hour and a half at most, because at his age, doing this kind of work tires him out. When he’s done, he returns home to rest.

When reflecting on his career, Rochlin says, “I didn’t realize when I walked in the door in 1938 that I would spend the rest of my life. Paul Weiss was my life. The way I looked on the firm, it was not only a community of scholars but a community of friends.” Congratulations to Mordie Rochlin on a life well lived in the law at a firm that continues to be worth the effort, even as a centenarian.

# Being A Young Attorney Isn't All It's Cracked Up To Be
## Biglaw isn't always pretty, but at least it's lucrative.

Nothing like this…

Longtime Above the Law readers know we throw a considerable amount of water on the idea that being a young lawyer is all sunshine and exciting, substantive work. It’s mostly grueling hours, all-nighters, and mind-numbing rote tasks that you grind out for mostly thankless bosses and clients. It’s part of the reason why bonus season is so much fun. Because when it comes to expecting praise as a young attorney, Biglaw’s response is…

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

There is a method to this process though. Biglaw is the giant Sorting Hat that funnels law school graduates to their best purpose. Some stick it out and become Biglaw partners, but more will find their way to smaller firms, government jobs, in-house work, legal service vendors, or, hey, maybe legal journalism. It doesn’t “weed” people out as much as it’s a crucible that shows a young lawyer both their true skills under fire and what they really value out of a career.

Elie Mystal and I got together with Andrew Eisbrouch and Jesse Weber of the Law & Crime network podcast Guys Who Law to discuss what it’s like to work in the legal industry these days — warts and all. We also have an aside to discuss the Jim Acosta kerfuffle and… it turned out pretty much as we predicted.

# A Front-Row Seat To The Rise Of Litigation Finance: An Interview With Marla Decker

Marla Decker

Three years ago, Marla Decker [left her career](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/introducing-marla-decker-from-litigator-to-litigation-funder/) as a complex commercial litigator at Cleary Gottlieb to become Managing Director at Lake Whillans Litigation Finance. She went from being a senior associate at one of the world’s most prestigious and established law firms to the [first full-time employee](https://lakewhillans.com/articles/marla-decker-from-litigator-to-funder/) of a promising but young firm in a still-emerging field.

It was a big risk — and it paid off. Both litigation finance and Lake Whillans have grown tremendously since 2015. At the end of 2017, Lake Whillans [closed a $125 million](https://www.law360.com/articles/998726/lake-whillans-closes-125m-litigation-funding-round) round of [funding](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2018/01/03/litigation-finance-outfit-lake-whillans-raises-125m-fund/). In May 2018, the firm won recognition as one of the nation’s top four litigation funders, in the inaugural ranking of litigation-finance firms by Chambers and Partners. And Lake Whillans has expanded its stable of top talent, adding [Chris Hagale](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/litigation-funder-lake-whillans-hires-former-bartlit-beck-litigator-as-managing-director/), formerly of Bartlit Beck, and [Garrett Ordower](https://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/05/22/wachtell-lawyer-jumps-to-litigation-funder/), formerly of Wachtell Lipton.

Three years later, how does Marla Decker feel about her momentous move? Last week, I met up with her at the Optimistic Cafe — a fittingly named venue for discussing a booming industry — to find out.

DL: Back in 2015, you took a risk, leaving a thriving career at a leading law firm to become the first full-time employee of one of the first litigation funders. Are you glad you made the jump?

MD: Very glad. My colleagues at Cleary were great, but so are my colleagues here at Lake Whillans, some of the smartest people I’ve ever met. I appreciate our process for evaluating cases, which is both organic and methodical, and our supportive, collaborative environment.

DL: Even if you’re glad you made this move, what do you miss about either practicing law or practicing law in Biglaw?

MD: There are people I miss working with, and I miss some of the accoutrements of law-firm life, from robust secretarial support to wine and cheese on Fridays. They’ve been made up for in other ways, but perks are certainly a draw of Biglaw.

In terms of practicing law, I miss the unpredictability of being on my feet in a courtroom or in the middle of a deposition, having just one moment to get it right — a definite adrenaline rush. But I do find my current role more intellectually engaging on a consistent basis.

DL: That might surprise some people. Practicing law at the highest levels is very intellectually challenging, isn’t it?

MD: Absolutely, and I had a broad and fulfilling practice at Cleary. But the types of cases we review for possible funding at Lake Whillans are so diverse across subject areas, and they come from around the country and even around the world. The factual and legal issues run the gamut; I might be looking at a pharmaceutical-licensing dispute on one day and a supply-chain dispute on the next. This differs from law-firm practice, where lawyers tend to specialize and where, if you’re staffed on a major case, you could be living and breathing that case for the next 18 months.

DL: Which skills from your Cleary years have carried over well into your current work?

MD: Certainly legal analysis, inquisitiveness, and big-picture thinking about cases and strategies. Coming into litigation finance after having been a litigator helps you understand the process and pace of a case, where parties might gain and lose leverage, and which legal issues are more significant than others.

Client management skills have also proven helpful, in terms of dealing with claimholders in a positive way. People come to us as funders like clients approaching lawyers: they have a problem, they need help, and they’re trusting us with a matter of great importance to them. Good communication is essential to getting on the same page and building mutual trust.

DL: Let’s turn to the process of evaluating cases, aka underwriting. How does Lake Whillans decide whether to fund a case?

MD: In general, for an incoming inquiry, one of the principals will have a phone call to screen the case and see if it fits our parameters. After that threshold review, we’ll execute a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) and have a deep-dive call, with most if not all of us at Lake Whillans on the line, to learn in detail about the case or opportunity (if it’s a portfolio of cases). We’ll want to learn about the facts, the potential damages, the procedural history (if any), and what the claimholders might be seeking in terms of a financial transaction.

If we’re interested, then we’ll generate an investment hypothesis and propose a term sheet. We might then negotiate over the terms, but we want to float terms early in the process so we don’t waste time on diligence if we’re too far apart on terms.

If we reach agreement on terms, then we go through full diligence, trying to prove out the investment hypothetical. Do the facts and the law support the thesis? Can the facts be established with admissible evidence? Is the investment hypothesis’s timeframe right? This involves a careful review of documents and discussion with the claimholders and their counsel.

DL: Speaking of diligence, we know you [did your homework](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/introducing-marla-decker-from-litigator-to-litigation-funder/?rf=1) before making the jump into litigation finance. Now, a few years in, what has surprised you about your current job or field?

MD: I’m surprised by how litigation finance has already been through multiple iterations in such a short period of time. When I first entered, most users of litigation funding were Davids in David v. Goliath battles — small or midsized companies, often cash-strapped, up against much larger entities. But so much has changed since then.

First, there’s more demand from law firms for portfolio funding, or funding for a collection of cases. Imagine a law firm has a contingent interest in some number of cases, all at various points in the litigation life cycle, and it wants to accelerate monetization of those interests. It can do that through funding, instead of waiting 12 or 18 months before seeing any money.

Second, the types of corporates using funding are different. Large-cap companies are using funding to take litigation costs off their balance sheets, to monetize an asset — a claim in litigation — that they might not have pursued but for funding.

Third, there’s much greater demand for funding of international arbitrations.

Finally, the volume of incoming leads is exponentially larger today compared to three years ago.

DL: You mentioned increased use of funding by large companies. What’s driving that trend?

MD: A few factors. First, law departments and in-house lawyers face constant pressure to reduce expenses. If you can shrink your budget by moving litigation costs to a funder, you’ve achieved that. Moving expenses off your balance sheet is especially desirable if the company has some transaction coming up where the value of the company will matter. If you have expenses going out for litigation, that’s taking away from your EBITDA and lowering your valuation.

Second, awareness about financing has grown dramatically. People are coming to understand how litigation finance can [change our legal system for the better](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/introducing-marla-decker-from-litigator-to-litigation-funder/?rf=1), by leveling the playing field between plaintiffs and defendants, helping companies to pursue their business objectives, and bringing meritorious cases before the courts.

DL: So I understand Lake Whillans doesn’t have any openings right now, but what advice would you offer current Biglaw litigators thinking about following your footsteps into litigation finance?

MD: First, research the funders — who’s growing, hiring, and raising money. Identify the funders whose target investments align well with your skills. For example, at Lake Whillans we don’t handle patent cases, so if you’re a patent litigator, other funders might be a better fit.

Second, develop a broad litigation practice, where you’re exposed to many different cases within your firm. This will be useful when analyzing a diverse range of cases for possible funding. If there are cases in your firm that have been funded, try to get involved. It’s helpful to have a lawyer’s perspective on how litigation financing works.

Third, follow the funding industry closely — for example, by reading [our blog!](https://lakewhillans.com/articles/)

DL: Besides litigators with broad experience, what other types of lawyers might thrive in litigation finance?

MD: Lawyers who are entrepreneurial, such as partners who have built up books of business and developed strong client relationships. Litigation finance is entrepreneurial. It attracts lawyers who are willing to take risks, tackle novel challenges, and go on new adventures.

DL: Well, it sounds like you’re enjoying this adventure, three years in. Congratulations on your success so far, and thanks for taking the time to chat!

Marc Kasowitz (screenshot via YouTube)

That feeling when the New York Times has a headline about your biggest client wanting to fire you… and it’s not the worst news story about you that day.

Donald Trump and Marc Kasowitz made quite the pair. The bombastic businessman and the pugilistic attorney teamed up repeatedly over the years to bully any number of folks in the rough-and-tumble world of big-time real estate. But the relationship has apparently fallen on hard times, [according to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/russia-trump.html):

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Advisers said the president was annoyed not so much by his son as by the headlines. But three people close to the legal team said he had also trained his ire on Marc E. Kasowitz, his longtime lawyer, who is leading the team of private lawyers representing him. Mr. Trump, who often vents about advisers in times of trouble, has grown disillusioned by Mr. Kasowitz’s strategy, the people said.

Sad! Seriously, it’s always upsetting to see a beautiful relationship strained like this. Before all this, Trump trusted Kasowitz so much he hired him — after [four firms told him no](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/the-biglaw-firms-that-said-no-to-trump/) — to handle the most high-profile criminal probe in the country. Sure, Kasowitz didn’t have the sort of white-collar criminal defense expertise one would expect for that role — something we pointed out was [absolutely insane](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/marc-kasowitz-will-you-accept-this-rose/) at the time — but we heard it was all about trust for The Donald.

That trust may now be gone.

But hey, maybe Kasowitz is going to get out ahead of this thing:

The president’s lawyers view [presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared] Kushner as an obstacle and a freelancer more concerned about protecting himself than his father-in-law, the person said. While no ultimatum has been delivered, the lawyers have told colleagues that they cannot keep operating that way, raising the prospect that Mr. Kasowitz may resign.

So there are some problems with that:

/3 If Kasowitz or anyone at his firm are leaking information about their representation of Trump, that's unethical and outrageous.

— NothingburgerPopehat (@Popehat) [July 12, 2017](https://twitter.com/Popehat/status/884951527625969665)

/4 if Kasowitz and his team aren't leaking themselves, but are flapping their mouths to unreliable people who leak, that's outrageous.

— NothingburgerPopehat (@Popehat) [July 12, 2017](https://twitter.com/Popehat/status/884951669942833153)

Hmm. If only we knew of one member of that legal team who’s a notorious braggart who [can’t keep his mouth shut in public](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/marc-kasowitz-takes-break-from-partying-at-trump-hotel-to-talk-to-the-press/)…

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But, amazingly, the backbiting at 1600 Trump Avenue — I assume we’ve renamed the street by now — isn’t the worst story for Kasowitz today. ProPublica reports that Kasowitz has yet to seek security clearance, which would seem like a basic requirement of representing Trump in an obstruction probe all about sensitive dealings with the Russians. And lest you think this is just a bad oversight, ProPublica says Kasowitz probably can’t get security clearance because their sources tell them there [may be alcohol-abuse issues](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-russia-lawyer-marc-kasowitz-alcohol-security-clearance):

In recent weeks, ProPublica spoke with more than two dozen current and former employees of Kasowitz’s firm, Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, as well as his friends and acquaintances. Past and present employees of the firm said in interviews that Kasowitz has struggled intermittently with alcohol abuse, leading to a stint in rehab in the winter of 2014-15.

Several people told ProPublica that Kasowitz has been drinking in recent months. (The vast majority of those who spoke to ProPublica for this article declined to be quoted by name, citing Kasowitz’s penchant for threatening lawsuits.)

This comes as a [complete shock to us](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/is-marc-kasowitz-drunk-on-his-own-power/).

Unfortunately the article gets even more embarrassing, discussing holiday party shenanigans and a former hostess at the Palm restaurant. Kasowitz, through a spokesperson, provided statements of employees indicating that his behavior that night was fine and denying any untoward relationship with the hostess.

While everyone hopes these tales of relapse (assuming the story about a past rehab stint is true) are just noise for his health, if there’s any truth to them, he needs to go ahead and resign this sinkhole of a case and get back to basics. He’s got a good practice and [a firm feeling a bit of pressure](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/when-people-start-writing-about-you-destroying-your-firm-things-arent-going-well/) — go tend to that.

In any event, it’s not a good day for Kasowitz.

# Stat Of The Week: How Much Can A Bad Lateral Hire Cost A Firm?
## It's more than you might think, and more than the partner's annual compensation.

It’s no secret that a bad lateral hire can cost a firm a pretty penny. But how much are we talking about exactly?

Here’s an estimate, contained in an interesting article on [lateral hiring misfires](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/06/23/hiring-misfires-show-need-for-tougher-law-firm-vetting/), by Scott Flaherty for Law.com:

“Fifty percent of all laterals will fail within five years. And that pretty much shows up across the board in every study that’s been done,” said Michael Ellenhorn, co-founder and general counsel of Decipher, a human resources and market intelligence business.

Missteps can be costly for law firms, which often shell out money for recruiters and may offer guaranteed compensation deals to their hires, especially in their first year at the firm. In all, Ellenhorn said, the cost of a failed lateral partner can be as much as 200-400 percent of that lawyer’s actual compensation, including the costs of replacing the lawyer after a departure.

We’ve previously warned lawyers considering lateral moves to [look before they leap](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/10/quote-of-the-day-look-before-you-leap-laterals/). The same advice applies to law firms as well.

As the year draws to a close and Biglaw associates realize just how exhausted they are after billing thousands upon thousands of hours, some may suddenly become even more exhausted when they realize all they can do to comfort themselves is curl up with a big pile of money. Material things aren’t all that matter, after all, and one Biglaw firm has chosen to reward its incredibly hardworking associates with something that’s even more exciting than a market-shattering bonus: some time off on the firm’s dime — up to 150,000 of them, to be exact.

Which firm is offering its associates up to $15,000 to take a much-needed vacation?

It’s Orrick, and the firm really wants to show associates who have gone above and beyond the call of duty just how much it appreciates the long days and even longer nights that they’ve spent working and sacrificing personal time that they could’ve been spending with family and friends. As a bonus, it’s not just associates who are being offered this opportunity — dedicated of counsel, career associates, project attorneys, paralegals, and legal assistants may be able to participate as well.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Here’s more information on who could be eligible for this unique program:

To express our gratitude and to help you recover, recharge and reconnect, we are offering those members of our team aspecial gift from the firm that we’re calling Unplug On Us.

If you’ve put in 2,400 annualized client representation hours during the 2018 performance year – including pro bono, training and shadowing, innovation time and work for the firm,have been with us for at least six months and are in good standing, we want to make absolutely sure you plan a week’s vacation early in 2019 – and we’ll pick up the cost (up to $15,000).

This is, of course, in addition to the merit and other bonuses that all of our team members may receive under our year-end bonus program (and this year’s special two-part “summer bonus”). It’s intended to support those who have worked at truly extraordinary levels and to ensure you have some time to take care of yourself.

Flip to the next page to see the full memo about the firm’s vacation program.

This program came to be after Mitch Zuklie, Orrick’s chairman and CEO, told the rest of the firm’s leadership about a time early on in his career when his then-firm sent him and his wife on vacation after an especially tough work period. The experience had been so “personally meaningful” to him that he and his colleagues wanted their valued team members to enjoy something similar. Then and there, Orrick’s Unplug On Us program was created to bring some additional work/life balance to the firm.

About 10 percent of associates are candidates for the program this year. Here’s a note one of the New York associates who qualified for Unplug On Us sent to firm leaders:

Thank you so much for this. It’s such a nice surprise. And while I’m sure every economist in the world will tell you I’m being illogical, I am happier that this is earmarked for a vacation rather than if we simply got the equivalent in a bonus. It was a genius idea. The vacation is something I’m very excited about, and probably would never have done without this.

Chief Talent Officer Siobhan Handley said that Orrick’s leadership recognized the “incredible intensity level” that some of their team members committed to their work this year, and wanted to celebrate their contributions to the firm. “We wanted to thank them in a way that would be special — and we also wanted to make sure they are taking care of themselves and that we help them create an opportunity to unplug,” Handley said. “While this has always been a focus at Orrick, our attention to it, and I think our entire profession’s attention, has really been heightened in the past year.”

Congratulations to all of the employees at Orrick who may be able to take advantage of this new perk! Is your firm doing anything as extravagant as offering $15,000 for its tireless employees to go on vacation? Please get in touch with us [via email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or text us (646-820-8477) and let us know. Thanks very much, and happy holidays!

# The 'Culture Card' In Law Firms
## Why 'preserving culture' can be code for stifling innovation in law firms.

“I swear, culture is a dirty word when it comes to law firms.” A good lawyer friend of mine was visiting from out of town recently. The two of us and few colleagues grabbed dinner and started talking shop. “If I hear another lawyer throw around ‘preserving culture’ to justify rejecting a new idea,” he said, “my head’s gonna explode.”

But wait — isn’t preserving firm culture a good thing?

The value of firm culture is hard to overstate. A strong, identifiable culture can be a difference maker for a firm looking to retain current attorneys, market itself to laterals, and set its long-term strategies and goals. People want to participate in something bigger than themselves, and culture can provide that. Firms with positive, supportive cultures generally take pains to achieve them, and don’t want to give them up without a fight. Culture matters.

But good cultures have to be more than doing what we’ve done before. “Preserving culture” too often becomes shorthand for “we’ve done things this way forever, so we’re not going to reevaluate it.” Healthy cultures need to evolve.

I’ve heard lawyers from firms large and small, across the country, complaining about going through the same old cycle. Lawyer A proposes buying a new refrigerator for the attorney lounge to replace the current broken one. Lawyer B passionately opines that there’s nothing wrong with the current refrigerator, the departed founders of the firm used to keep their sandwiches in that exact same refrigerator, that refrigerator was part of the reason they and many others joined the firm, and replacing the refrigerator would irreparably damage the firm’s culture — leading to its to slow, painful demise. Fear of a potential apocalypse causes the new refrigerator concept to be safely referred to a committee for revision, where the idea loses steam. Lawyer A learns not to bother trying to make things better, Lawyer B learns nothing, and the refrigerator is still broken. Apply as needed to all proposed changes, rinse, repeat.

Once a lawyer plays the “culture card,” it’s game over for most any new idea.

Part of this is probably the fundamental tension of attorneys running their own business. As lawyers, we’re trained to look for potential failure points in any proposal our clients bring to us. We catastrophize. Our job is to call out risk factors and err on the side of caution. If we fail to notify our clients of a problem that later crops up, our relationships and business are on the line. The status quo is safe, and safe is good.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
That kind of cautious-to-a-fault mentality is invaluable when we’re counseling our clients, but it can be absolute death when trying to run our firms. In order for firms to be successful in times of rapid change and declining demand, it takes the stomach to take risks and embrace change — concepts that make people trained at avoiding risk queasy.

Several of my teammates and I recently had the opportunity to tour the Las Vegas headquarters of Zappos, the internet shoe juggernaut. Zappos operates nothing like a typical international retail giant, but it’s running on a model that more and more companies may emulate in the future.

Internet companies, by their nature, involve people with a sense of adventure and willingness to accept risk. At some point, the founder of Zappos said, “You know shoes, those things you always try on in the store before you buy them? Let’s sell those over the internet, where trying them on is impossible.” The counter-intuitive idea somehow worked, and Zappos has been dominating its market and raking in comfortable profits for years.

But Zappos realized that even the best ideas have a shelf life. In 2013, Zappos’s leadership became convinced that in order to survive and thrive in the competitive e-commerce space over the long haul, it needed to rethink the business model that led to its initial success. As part of this effort, Zappos implemented a companywide policy of “[holacracy](http://fortune.com/zappos-tony-hsieh-holacracy/).” In holacratic companies, there are no traditional managers. Top-down org charts and job titles are basically non-existent. Self-management is the name of the game.

Zappos’s leadership expected the change to cause some dissatisfaction, and it leaned into those feelings. Every employee received an offer to opt for a generous buyout with no hard feelings if they didn’t like the new direction. Attrition soared, and those who remained struggled to implement a wildly different system that had never been attempted in a business of Zappos’s scale in the modern era. The growing pains were real, and Zappos’s critics stood ready to call it a disaster in the making.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Then, quietly, Zappos posted its highest operating profit in company history.

By all accounts, the transition to holacracy remains a work-in-progress, but the company weathered the initial criticism and attrition. Its employees refined the new systems to fit their needs. Productivity is up, and the team vision is united across a company that is now nimbler than it was before. The radical reinvention of the company ended up reaffirming and refining Zappos’s fundamental culture: one of innovation, determination, and fearlessness.

I’m not advocating that law firms jump onboard the holacracy movement. Our ethics rules require more formality and supervision than the format provides. Every business in every industry will have its own unique needs. The point is that Zappos’ leadership understood that company culture needs to evolve in a way that propels a business forward — not holds it back.

Firms that fail to adjust their cultures to the changing market risk losing market share, or just losing their shirt. Am Law 100 firms working off the high-leverage, high-billables model will need to come to terms with the fact that technology and an influx of low-cost competitors are eroding the foundation of their profit pyramid. Am Law Second Hundred firms and below have to take a long look in the mirror and admit that [stalling demand](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/12/14/in-2018-law-firms-will-face-greater-challenges-than-slow-growth/) means that having a building filled with the “best lawyers” in town simply isn’t enough anymore. Barring a unique market position or a lot of luck, stagnant firm cultures are doomed to fail in a legal market that is shifting at a break-neck pace.

Positive change takes time and effort. It’s often ugly, and there will be haters aplenty. It might fail, and guess what: that’s okay. A moderate dose of failure is necessary for any successful company. It means new ideas are being implemented. Some ideas that made all the sense in the world end up faceplanting. That doesn’t mean it was wrong to try them out. There are attorneys out there who brag about having never lost a case. Chances are that just means they never took on a case that was actually worth fighting.

Invoking a law firm’s culture to shut down experimentation and new ideas doesn’t just preserve the existing culture, whatever that may be. It inculcates a deeper culture into the firm, one of fear, stasis, and decay. You can’t have a firm culture if your firm doesn’t survive. Everything about the world of legal business is up for grabs in the coming years. Resistance to change is no longer just stodgy — it’s swiftly becoming an existential threat.

Whether culture is a good or bad thing depends on where you find it. In museums and art galleries, culture means intelligence, refinement, and beauty. In a lab, culture means a plate of mold. Culture should be something that drives a law firm to grow, not something that grows over a law firm’s corpse.

As the good times roll on for Biglaw, the revolving door between law firms and the government continues to spin. We’ve written about [prominent prosecutors leaving for private practice](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/more-prominent-prosecutors-leaving-for-private-practice/), and we’ve covered former solicitor general Don Verrilli [joining](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/solicitor-general-don-verrilli-to-head-up-d-c-office-for-surprising-biglaw-firm/?rf=1) the elite firm of Munger Tolles & Olson, to [launch MTO’s D.C. office](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/a-deeper-dive-into-don-verrillis-move-to-munger-tolles-olson/).

These events have now converged, in a notable new hire for Munger Tolles. As reported by [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/850349/ex-deputy-appeals-chief-at-usao-joins-munger-tolles-in-la-):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The former deputy chief of appeals at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California has joined Munger Tolles & Olson LLP as counsel in Los Angeles focused on complex litigation and appeals, the firm said Monday, marking another huge get for the firm in the last few weeks.

News of Mark R. Yohalem’s arrival at Munger Tolles’ Los Angeles office comes shortly after the California law firm — which had, until recently, offices in just LA and San Francisco — said former U.S. Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. is to open up its new Washington, D.C. office alongside veteran litigator Michael DeSanctis and former deputy associate attorney general Chad Golder.

Like Verrilli, DeSanctis, and Golder, Yohalem also has a gilded résumé. Before joining the U.S. Attorney’s Office, where he spent the past seven years of his career, he graduated from Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School, and clerked for Judge Pamela Ann Rymer (9th Cir.) and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. (And, as we’ve mentioned before, he’s a [video game writer](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/07/all-your-base-are-belong-to-this-harvard-law-grad-and-former-scotus-clerk/) too.)

Yohalem previously worked at Munger, right before becoming a federal prosecutor. So his going to MTO represents a homecoming of sorts — and means that the parties have a high comfort level with each other. As Yohalem told Law360, “I had already had relationships with people here and wanted to return to that environment where you’re working with brilliant lawyers on a variety of matters.”

Congratulations to Mark Yohalem and to Munger Tolles on the happy match. To my mind, here’s the biggest “danger,” from Munger’s point of view: Yohalem following in the footsteps of multiple Munger alums — Judges Paul Watford, John Owens, and Michelle Friedland — and leaving in short order for the Ninth Circuit.

# What LMA Attendees Will Be Taking Home This Year
## Come for the substance, leave with the swag, at the largest annual meeting of the legal marketing profession.

Today marks the end of the [Legal Marketing Association’s annual gathering](https://www.lmapartnerships.org/lma24/), which drew 1,200 attendees, including about 400 new members, to the San Diego waterfront.

It’s the largest global meeting exclusively for the legal marketing and business development profession, and the agenda was filled with programs exploring niche areas — concrete use cases for AI, deep dives into data use in marketing, and [much](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/today-at-lma-ai-deep-dive-fishbowl-sessions-keynote-kickoff/) [more](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/today-at-lma-top-picks-for-novices-veterans-and-data-junkies/).

We’ll be sharing insights from the event in the coming week on our new [LMA on ATL channel](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/introducing-lma-on-atl-a-growing-trove-of-marketing-and-biz-dev-insight/).

But like just about everybody else, we do love our swag. Without further ado, here’s a sampling of what lucky LMA attendees will be taking home this year.  



First, be sure to hydrate.

Attendees at Thursday morning’s kickoff and keynote found these water bottles waiting on their table, courtesy of Great Jakes.



De Novo Digital’s gummy bear test tubes provided a promising welcome to the Marketplace area.





In the past, I’ve admittedly made a conference rookie mistake: deciding to break in new shoes at an event (in Las Vegas, of all places). The multiple padded-sock swag options, courtesy of QorusDocs and Litera, would have been helpful.



As a person with the last name “Barker,” Introhive’s swag distribution methods won my strong approval. 



In a striking coincidence, I was greeted with “Come on down!” as I approached the Smith.ai booth, featuring these highly addictive swag mints (IYKYK). 



PlayPlay provided the welcome possibility, however remote, of a conference floor hack circle. 



Having just closed out the notebook I acquired at LMA23, I was happy to pick up this offering from our friends at Intapp. 



Profitsolv’s blue-light glasses were among the fastest-moving items in the hall.



Passle’s iconic octopus also made an appearance.



S&P Global brought a welcome mix of serious and fun (with some high-end pens to boot).



Forget the New Yorker tote. Show off your Chambers prowess instead.



After starting the day with a water bottle, closing it out with a Krishtel coffee mug was a satisfying bookend.

# Will Biglaw Firms Use Layoff Fears To Get Associates Back Into The Office?

We’re still in the rumor stage, but there’s a growing level of concern, absolutely. And of course younger people who don’t have a book of business or aren’t in the stage of developing a partial book of business are very concerned.

— Law firm management consultant Patrick McKenna, commenting on associates’ layoff fears amid falling demand for legal services in a recent interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/09/20/lagging-demand-and-layoff-fears-give-firms-leverage-over-talent-will-they-use-it/). Will this incentivize firms to do more to get associates back into the office? Harry Austin, a U.K.-based consultant at Deacon, noted that given today’s economics, “Firms can get away with being much more conservative and so the power is back in their hands.”

# Biglaw Bonus News! Another Firm Announces Before Thanksgiving
## Getting back in the bonus groove.

Bonus season came early this year, when the market standard was set by [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/). But moving on bonuses the first week of November has some downsides — well, for the rest of the market, as some firms were caught flat-footed and weren’t able to match that scale immediately. Even perennial bonus leader Cravath had to take a few days [to announce their match](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/) of the scale. But once Cravath got on board, we had [the early adopters](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/associate-bonus-watch-2019/) rush to announce their bonuses.

But then, nothing much happened. Crickets. On the one hand, it’s completely understandable — we are still a week out from Thanksgiving. But your Above the Law editors were getting antsy waiting for the next announcement, and I’m sure a lot of associates out there can feel me on that one. Fortunately, Sidley came through with their year-end bonus scale:

Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012  – $100,000
Class of 2011+ – $100,000

The bonuses come with a catch however: Associates must bill a minimum of 2,000 hours, 1,800 of which must be client chargeable and/or legal services to the firm.

Above the Law is putting together our second annual [list](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/in-house-counsel-tell-us-about-your-outside-law-firms/) of the best law firms, according to you, the in-house counsel who have to work with these people. General counsels and legal departments hire these firms, and seem to know the firms better than they know themselves. They know which firms are reliable, which firms are cost effective, and which firms to go to if their jobs depend on it.

So, in-house counsel, please give us your input. Please take this very brief [survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e8MutYkqn3mdW29) and tell us which outside firms you use, and why they’re great (or… not).

# Campaign Donation Figures Confirm That Lawyers Really, Really Don't Like Trump

As lawyers, you rest at the center of that Venn diagram of “high-information voter” and “having enough disposable income to actually do something about it” so it’s unsurprising that lawyer money flows into political campaigns with as much ease as it flows to Sallie Mae. With the exception of some talented personal injury attorneys who buy private jets and football fields, lawyers
[aren’t often among the super-rich](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/the-state-with-the-poorest-lawyers/). Put simply, lawyers generally have enough money to

[buy their kid into an Ivy](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/disgraced-former-biglaw-chair-gets-jail-time-for-his-role-in-college-admissions-scandal/), but not enough to buy a new dorm to get their kid into an Ivy. It’s a subtle but important difference.
But as long as we have campaign finance laws — by that I mean, until the next Supreme Court case on campaign finance — lawyers can play with the plutocrats when it comes to giving to individual political campaigns, making attorneys an enviable sector of the donor class for any candidate to bring into the tent.

Bloomberg Law’s Roy Strom [took a deep dive into attorney donations](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/snubbing-trump-lawyers-doling-more-cash-to-democrats) and found that lawyers are helping out the Democrats this cycle at an almost unbelievable clip. As of today, 95 percent of law firm employee cash is going to Democrats:

Lawyers and employees of the nation’s law firms have contributed nearly $17 million to presidential campaigns so far this election cycle and 95% of the total has gone to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. President Donald Trump’s campaign has raised just over $785,000 from lawyers and law firms.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In fairness, the Democratic contest boasts the largest field in history while the Republicans are so all in on Trump that [they’re canceling primaries](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/06/republicans-cancel-primaries-trump-challengers-1483126). Money should flow to the contests that are being, you know, contested. On the other hand, the Center for Responsive Politics compared figures up through the third quarter of the year before an election since 2004 — another election featuring a Republican incumbent who had lost the popular vote — and found that traditionally Republicans secure 41 percent of lawyer donations by this point. In that context, the swing to a 95-5 margin is damning.

Even Jones Day is giving 70-30 in favor of Democratic candidates! Maybe they just want all their partners back.

Call it the George Conway effect if you want. Conway’s impassioned defense of the rule of law against the machinations of his own wife reflects the mood of a lot of long-time conservative lawyers watching their brand of smugly ruthless libertarianism get ground into the mud by Trump’s soggy noodle Il Duce impression. These are the people who really relished the prep school blazer image and it’s all crumbling into a morass of monster truck rallies and meth. At this point, the only conservative lawyers still backing Trump are either already on the bench or currently ignoring a subpoena. Meanwhile firms are driving dumptrucks full of cash to Democratic candidates.

But which candidates get the most love from attorneys? Joe Biden is taking top marks right now, but he’s also the frontrunner and likely locked up his dollars before embarking on his traditional Democratic primary quest of alienating every single constituency one by one. Kamala Harris unsurprisingly receives the second most love based on a campaign predicated entirely upon reminding everyone that she is, in fact, a lawyer. There are associates going home for their first Thanksgiving since passing the bar next week who won’t hear about their job as much as Harris will mention it in a 24-hour period. This also tracks if one reads these donations as a sign that conservative lawyers are crossing over this cycle, giving a boost to the two most conservative candidates in the field who aren’t Michael Bloomberg’s vanity project. It also likely explains why Mayor Pete clocks in at third, probably surging in donations after he decided he’d junk his whole campaign to that point and try to be a version of Joe Biden before the weight of his decades of licking his finger and sticking it in the political light socket wore him down.

Law professor Liz Warren is getting the sixth most, putting her right ahead of Trump, despite offering the legal industry a lifeline with the promise of unending antitrust and consumer protection suits. There might be a lot of Harvard Law grads out there still too shaken by a cold call to give her their money.

Holiday cheer runs high in law firms this year. Biglaw associates remain grateful for that [pay raise](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1) earlier in the year, and now firms are following [Santa Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/) and stuffing the stockings of young lawyers with bountiful bonuses.

From the partners’ perspective, the Christmas trees remain green — with money. Some firms are [killing it](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-strikes-back-the-rich-firms-get-richer-this-quarter/), and even the firms that aren’t are [holding steady](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/the-legal-industry-is-still-on-life-support/). In an industry where [six- and seven-figure incomes are the norm](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/where-do-lawyers-fall-in-the-top-income-brackets/), treading water is no small accomplishment.

Imbued with the holiday spirit, let’s review the eight finalists for our [eighth annual holiday card contest](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/above-the-laws-8th-annual-holiday-card-contest/). But first let’s give shout-outs to some honorable mentions (click on each firm’s name to see its card):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
1. [Ballard Spahr](https://vimeo.com/194059346/43c2c33e7d): Cheery and charming music (selected by [Blind Melon guitarist turned Biglaw associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/alternative-rock-god-decides-to-be-a-lawyer-joins-biglaw-firm/) Rogers Stevens), simple but well-executed animation, and shout-outs to charities the firm supports. A little too safe to make the finals, but a solid effort.

2. [Epstein Becker & Green](http://www.ebglaw.com/holiday16): An interactive card offering ten tips for a sustainable and socially responsible holiday. It contains links to some useful resources and to [Heifer International](https://www.heifer.org/), the beneficiary of Epstein Becker Green’s holiday donation.

3. [Meyers Nave](http://www.meyersnave.com/holiday/): From the nominator: “This is an Olympic card! Gold for originality, an impressively unique idea. Silver for cleverness, a very smart way to be interactive. Bronze for bold je ne sais quoi, [spoiler alert!] with talking trees delivering the message. And you can’t beat the zeitgeist use of emoji!” The talking trees reflect the firm’s support of the [National Forest Foundation](https://www.nationalforests.org/).

4. [Parry & Pfau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3ZenGJ_v8): The prior honorable mentions were too tame to make the finals; this entry was too long (over four minutes). But kudos for its deployment of the laugh track to poke good-natured fun at sitcoms, lawyers, and beauty queens.

5. [Sutliff & Stout](https://mytexasinjurylawyers.com/our-firm/christmas-card-2016/): This firm, a [former finalist](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/atl-holiday-card-contest-the-finalists-4/), goes for the funny once again, with its humorous parody of a Twitter account replete with election 2016 shout-outs.

And now, the eight finalists, in alphabetical order. Again, click on each firm’s name to view its card. Please note that most of these cards have SOUND, so you might want to turn your sound off or down, or use headphones. Explanatory comments come from firm representatives unless otherwise indicated.

1. [Akin Gump](http://remote.akingump.com/holidaycard2016/theclientmeeting/): It wouldn’t be a holiday-card contest without Akin Gump in the finals, would it? The firm, a two-time winner (2009 and 2013), returns to the finals with the “law firm version of Carpool Karaoke, involving a client meeting with a certain Jolly Old Elf with big legal liabilities.” The concept is great, and so’s the execution — the actors are actual Akin Gump attorneys.

2. [Davis Wright Tremaine](http://www.dwtholiday.com/): DWT boasts a top-flight media practice, so I wasn’t surprised to see its pop-culture-focused entry. “Winter is coming! We couldn’t wait for the next season of Game of Thrones so we let our design team go wild, especially since we’ve been named the [Most Innovative Law Firm by ILTA](http://www.dwt.com/Davis-Wright-Tremaine-Repeats-as-Innovative-Law-Firm-of-the-Year-08-31-2016/)—for the second year in a row.”

3. [Fenwick & West](http://fenwick.com/Videos/Pages/Seasons-Greetings-from-Fenwick-and-West.aspx): This year represents the firm’s sixth year in the finals. Fenwick is famous for its work on behalf of technology and startup companies, so the theme of this year’s offering makes perfect sense. Per chief marketing officer Rob Kahn: “The genesis for this year’s card was a partner walking into my office in May and saying, ‘This year’s holiday card should be in VR [virtual reality]!’ Well, I don’t think the partner understands law firm marketing budgets very well, but it gave us an idea. We ended up with something that fits our brand: tech-focused, and not taking ourselves too seriously. And we heeded your advice from last year, keeping it all under 60 seconds. Hope you enjoy, and sending thanks for all the great reporting and wishing you many good things in 2017.”

4. [Gowling WLG](https://sites-gowlingwlg.vuturevx.com/14/2647/landing-pages/gowling-wlg-video-all-lang.asp): The election 2016 results have some Americans wanting to move to Canada, but for this year’s holiday card contest, Canada comes to us. “Since combining in 2016 [through the merger of Canada-based Gowlings and UK-based Wragge Lawrence Graham], the firm’s goal was to focus on how going global has ‘knit us all together’ for the holidays. The associated [print card](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Gowling-updated-card.jpg) was done as a holiday sweater, complete with embossing and special details to imitate a knit sweater.” Some readers might find the Gowling card too safe, but it does deserve recognition for execution.

5. [Larson King](http://www.larsonking.com/lk_holiday_card/): Will the third time in the finals prove the charm for this St. Paul-based litigation boutique? Like the Gowling offering, it’s far from edgy but quite well done, with hand-drawn illustrations. “We wanted a card that captured Minnesota’s passion for hockey and winter. Hockey is a sport that is gritty but graceful and highlights team work and individual effort. This card connects the ethos of both Minnesota and our law firm.”

6. [Manatt, Phelps & Phillips](https://www.manatt.com/holiday-cards/2016/a-manatt-holiday-story?utm_source=HolidayCard2016&utm_campaign=A_Holiday_Story&utm_medium=email): It’s no surprise to see a firm with a top-tier entertainment practice in the finals for a fifth time — with a delightful card that tells a story. From the firm: “This year, Manatt spun a classic holiday poem, ‘Twas the night before Christmas,’ into a relatable seasonal tale.” But I like what fellow legal journalist Katelyn Polantz had to say when nominating the card: “My god, does it make Biglaw look like the worst job ever!”

7. [Proctor Heyman Enerio](http://www.proctorheyman.com/2016card.html#ph/0/): The Delaware boutique, a frequent finalist and former winner (2010), makes its last appearance in our contest — as “Proctor Heyman Enerio,” that is. “In this, our 10th year of practice at PHE, we say a heartfelt goodbye to our partner and friend, Vern Proctor, who is retiring at the end of the year. This year’s holiday card, which continues our customary invocation of iconic themes (now branching out from music to musicals), is a fitting farewell to Vern – if ever a wonderful wiz there was…. Effective January 1, 2017, the firm’s new name will be Heyman Enerio Gattuso & Hirzel LLP. Happy Holidays to all!”

8. [Wolf Greenfield](http://info.wolfgreenfield.com/wolf-greenfield-2016-holiday-card): “After [winning](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/atl-holiday-card-contest-the-winner-6/) last year’s ATL Holiday Card Contest, we knew we had to go bigger and better with this year’s holiday card. We tossed around some ideas with [Zach Umperovitch](http://info.wolfgreenfield.com/holiday-card-2015-behind-the-scenes), our Rube Goldberg expert who built the machine in last year’s video, and we got really excited about the possibilities: What if we did another Rube, but with cubicle dominos? What if a bowling ball bounced off a trampoline and smashed into a TV monitor? What if we put someone inside a giant zorb ball? We couldn’t resist. The Rube also fits perfectly with our firm’s reputation for technical knowhow; we’re an intellectual property firm, and more than 90% of our attorneys and technology specialists have science or engineering degrees. Our clients work at the cutting edge of science and technology, so we knew they’d appreciate the physics of this bigger, longer, more complex machine.” (There’s actually a lot more that can be said about the firm’s video; see this [behind-the-scenes look](http://info.wolfgreenfield.com/holiday-card-2016-behind-the-scenes) at Wolf Greenfield’s 2016 holiday card.)

Okay, time for the second-biggest vote of 2016. We’ll keep the polls open through SUNDAY, JANUARY 1, 2017, at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time). This gives you ample time to campaign for your pick over the holidays (but please don’t cheat — that would be, to quote our president-elect, “Sad!”).

Thanks to all the entrants and nominators, good luck to the finalists, and happy holidays to everyone!

Today’s topic: life as a lawyer handling labor and employment disputes.

1. What do you do in a typical day?

There is no typical day in labor and employment law practice! That’s part of what keeps it interesting and stimulating. Most management-side L&E attorneys have a mix of litigation and counseling in their practice, so many days are split between helping clients prevent litigation and defending clients against claims that are brought.

On the counseling side, an attorney’s day can be just as wildly unpredictable as the client’s day. The phone can ring at any moment with a client needing immediate advice (“An employee just refused to travel because of Zika concerns. Can we discipline him?” or “An employee just requested time off for an illness. What are our obligations under the FMLA, ADA, and sick leave laws?”) or help with longer-term projects (“Can you review our employee handbook for compliance with all the state and local laws where we have employees?” or “Can you conduct an audit of our workforce to make sure we have properly classified employees under the FLSA?”).

On the litigation side, the day will vary depending on the stage of the case. On any given day, an L&E litigator may be drafting pleadings, interviewing witnesses, conducting legal research, preparing motion papers, appearing for court conferences, preparing discovery requests and responses, taking and defending depositions, engaging in settlement discussions, and — if the case is not disposed of on a motion or settled — preparing for or participating in trial.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
A single-plaintiff case is typically staffed with a partner, associate, and paralegal. More attorneys may be added to class or collective actions or cases with multiple plaintiffs, and an attorney who specializes in electronic discovery may also assist, depending on the circumstances. This lean staffing allows associates of all levels to work closely and directly with partners and gain plenty of experience running cases.

As far as clients, the sky’s the limit. Any person, company, or organization that has employees is an “employer,” and therefore a potential client, regardless of sector, industry, or size. This affords an L&E attorney the opportunity to work with all sorts of interesting clients, from mom-and-pop shops and Fortune 500 companies to government entities and non-profit organizations, and everything in between. Depending on how hands-on the partner is, associates often work directly with the client representative, who may be a human resources manager, in-house counsel, an owner or executive, or an individually named defendant (for example, the supervisor or co-worker of the individual bringing a lawsuit).

L&E attorneys also frequently work with insurance companies, as many cases are covered by employment practices liability insurance (EPLI).

3. What does a common career path look like?

The career goal of many associates is either to become partner (typically after 8 or more years of practice) or in-house employment counsel (sometimes after only a few years of practice). However, these are not the only career paths available. Some associates who enjoy practicing law but do not want business-generating responsibilities prefer to transition to an “of counsel” role at their firm. Other attorneys choose to hang their own shingle, often taking on plaintiff-side work. Of course, there are also related career paths outside the practice of law.

4. If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?

The spiciest. In fact, I would venture to say it’s the chilli pepper of practice areas. As previously discussed, there is no typical day, and learning about different clients’ operations and industries is always pretty interesting. Aside from the variation in tasks and clients, each case brings a unique set of facts and allegations that are never boring and often require keen and creative legal analysis. Cases and work assignments never feel overly routine or rote.

Adding to this variety is the wide assortment of legal areas within labor and employment law, including employment discrimination, workplace harassment, wage and hour, family and medical leave, traditional labor, non-compete agreements, and health and safety … to name just a few. These areas of law are constantly evolving at the federal, state, and local law level, so there are always plenty of legal developments to shake things up.

5. How much wear and tear?

This all depends on the expectations and culture of the firm or other workplace. There is some variation across firms regarding the amount of annual billable hours associates are expected to achieve, as well as the consequences for not meeting those hours. Different firms also have different structures for assigning new cases, which can impact how heavy an associate’s workload is. However, because of the nature of litigation and unanticipated client emergencies, there will always be times that are fast-paced and require long hours.

6. Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?

Hate is a strong word, but the same challenges and pressures that make this practice area so interesting and appealing can also be daunting at times. For example, the unpredictability can be exciting or frustrating, depending on the day or perspective. The emotional nature and contentiousness of some cases can also take its toll. Even when the cases are not high stakes from a monetary perspective, there are other important things at stake like people’s livelihoods and careers.

7. Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?

Many L&E attorneys love that this practice area is so relatable and people-oriented. Anyone who has had a job can relate to the issues an L&E attorney encounters on a daily basis.

8. Are there common avenues out of this practice area?

L&E practitioner to in-house counsel is a common career path. Many companies have one or more in-house employment counsel positions, which are coveted by those L&E associates looking to transition to an in-house role. Other companies have a general counsel who takes on employment law issues along with many other legal responsibilities (for which know-how beyond just employment law is likely required).

The litigation and substantive experience gained by an L&E attorney also lends itself to a variety of other roles outside of a law firm. Many L&E attorneys transition to human resources, employee relations, and other similar roles with companies. Other opportunities include consulting (for example, outside companies offering harassment and diversity training to employers), recruiting, publishing, and the public sector (for example, judicial clerkships or agencies like the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Department of Labor, or Department of Justice).

9. What are some market trends that impact this practice area?

Employment law issues are not going away. But with pressure on clients to be more and more cost-conscious, many law firms are exploring ways to increase efficiency and reduce legal costs. We can expect to see clients requesting and law firms offering more creative cost structures and alternative staffing models, including options like flat-fee billing for certain projects and streamlined case management systems with dedicated attorneys for certain administrative agency charges and single-plaintiff cases.

10. If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?

Many of the qualities that make for a successful L&E attorney are things that apply to all good lawyers: dedication, work ethic, intellectual curiosity, problem-solving skills, and professional responsibility. Another important quality for this specific practice area is effective people skills because, in the end, this area of law is all about people. Whether it’s interviewing a witness about a sensitive topic, taking the deposition of plaintiff, or delivering difficult advice to a client, the ability to listen and communicate, understand and empathize, interact respectfully, manage conflict, and build trust is paramount.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

You would think that when firms are a little slower, that’s when programs would proliferate, but I’ve found the opposite. Firms are not as eager to make sure associates are staying if they don’t want to play by the same rules, but in very busy times like we saw in 2021, firms will do things outside the box to try to attract people.

— Legal recruiter [Michelle Fivel](https://www.hhflegalsearch.com/michelle-fivel) of Hatch Henderson Fivel, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2024/01/22/should-u-s-law-firms-offer-20-less-pay-for-20-less-work/) on Biglaw firms’ tendency to introduce work-life balance programs and policies during their busiest times (i.e., when firms are least able to fulfill their promises and associates are least able to take advantage of them). Attorneys across the board seem to want reduced workloads and time away from their crushing billable hour expectations, but few firms are able to deliver the desired respite.

# Trump Lawyers Produce More Comically Bad Drafting

Donald Trump (by Michael Vadon via Wikimedia)

A couple weeks back, the media worked itself into a tizzy when word got out that Trump’s lawyers from Jones Day told a federal judge that Trump’s detractors had “no right” to protest. As we pointed out, Trump’s [probably right on that one](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/trumps-lawyers-are-right-campaigns-can-kick-out-protestors/), but the whole affair forced us to ask how a law firm — with edit after edit after edit — could file a motion with such obviously provocative language. A dry, staid “the law is well-settled that campaigns have the right to exclude dissenters from events” would have scored all the substantive points they needed without making the case a top news story.

Not to be outdone in the annals of piss-poor drafting, Morgan Lewis has penned a [doozy of a letter](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/trump-lawyers-produce-more-comically-bad-drafting/2/) ostensibly to clear Trump of mounting speculation that he’s Russia’s bargain basement Manchurian Candidate. This letter was ill-advised in any event, as it simultaneously manages to show Trump is defensive about his Russia ties and remind everyone that he’s never released his tax returns. But tax partners [Sheri Dillon](https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/sdillon) and [William F. Nelson](https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/williamnelson) can’t control what their manic client demands. They could, however, avoid dumb lines like this:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
With a few exceptions — detailed below your tax returns do not reflect (1) any income of any type from Russian sources….

And with a few exceptions, I’ve hooked up with every Victoria’s Secret model. What the hell were they thinking with this? Just say, “Your tax returns reflect a few, discrete deals involving Russian funds and we detail these below.” By framing the paragraph around “exceptions,” the whole story is going to be about the exceptions. These contortions just so they can string together the more definitive — yet false — phrase “any income of any type from Russian sources” just blew away any credibility behind the letter. By the way, Trump’s gotten over $100 million from Russian sources according to Morgan Lewis — that’s the amount that they clarify as not “income of any type.” It’s much more relevant to focus on the fact that all his money from Russia came in the course of two transactions that were both known to the public, but instead they’ve decided to focus on this myth that he’s not made any real money from Russia.

And the Internet reacted with [the swiftness one would expect](http://gizmodo.com/trumps-lawyer-inspires-an-instant-meme-with-few-except-1795161639):

The only thing we have to fear is fear itself, with few exceptions.

I continue to believe that Trump is a micromanaging client who makes absurd language demands that end up undermining his lawyers’ work. That’s got to be it, right? Because I have a hard time believing that attorneys for Jones Day or Morgan Lewis are really this clueless. I mean, they’re both high quality firms boasting highly competent individuals with years of experience.

With a few exceptions.

# Disney Lawyers Seem Honestly Shocked That Ron DeSantis Legal Team Is So Bad At This
## This is basic civil procedure. How is this guy so bad at it?

“When you wish upon a star,” as the Disney classic goes, “your dreams come true.” Though the attorneys representing the company couldn’t have imagined that their chosen star could possibly grant them such a chronically bumbling adversary. In a manufactured culture war designed to prop up an [already floundering presidential bid](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4007704-florida-democrats-win-mayors-race-in-jacksonville-dealing-blow-to-desantis/), Ron DeSantis took aim at Disney for the sin of offering a mild rebuke of his “Don’t Say Gay” initiative by using his control of the Florida government to hit Disney’s bottom line… despite the company being a major employer and tax revenue source for the state. Strategery!

After trying to abolish Disney’s special tax district — [only to learn that this would cost the state millions](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/harvard-laws-ron-desantis-flunks-disneys-contract-issue-spotter/) — he resolved to replace the whole board with his stooges — who then forgot to object as [the existing board entered legally binding contracts functionally eliminating the future board’s authority](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/disneys-lawyers-are-better-than-ron-desantiss-lawyers/). Outlawyered through the slimmest of effort, DeSantis and the legislature passed a law barring the board from complying with the prior executed contracts [in violation of explicit language in the Constitution](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/disney-desantis-lawsuit-filed/), consequently landing them in federal court.

Unhappy with the obvious and inevitable consequences of his own actions, DeSantis had the board file a competing lawsuit in state court that was already riddled with procedural problems before [these idiots rendered their own case moot](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/business/media/disney-world-ron-desantis-lawsuit.html).

But the company’s argument about why the district’s case should be tossed was less expected: Mr. DeSantis and his allies in the Legislature rendered the lawsuit moot with their subsequent actions, the filing said. By prohibiting the district from complying with the contracts, Mr. DeSantis and the Legislature made “any order this court could issue — in either party’s favor — legally irrelevant.”

“In short, any declaration about the contracts’ enforceability, voidness or validity — either way — would be an advisory opinion with no real-world consequence,” Disney added in the filing. “Trial courts in Florida are forbidden from issuing advisory opinions.” The company cited more than 40 court rulings in support of its argument.

By choosing to pass the unconstitutional performative hissy fit to void the prior board’s contracts, Florida Republicans obliterated the litigation argument that the board shouldn’t have to comply with the contracts. No matter how doomed the Florida law functionally canceling the contracts — despite the Constitution saying verbatim “No state shall pass any Law impairing the obligation of contracts” — the fact remains that right now the new board suffers no injury from these contracts because the state law says they aren’t bound by the contracts. And if they aren’t obligated to live by the contracts, there’s no basis for a lawsuit over the contracts.

Had the new board directly gone to state court on the first day they took over claiming that the last-minute contracts were improperly executed under Florida law, they might have been able to make that stick. But instead, Florida Republicans couldn’t act fast enough to ram through this dumb law — making a bunch of retaliatory comments along the way — opening the door for Disney to file first in federal court on Contracts Clause and free speech grounds that blocked off the state route.

Strategically, this is like litigating against a coke fiend on a 48-hour bender.

Biglaw attorneys rarely get saucy in legal filings, but the motion reads as though most of the editing process involved removing early draft phrases like, “In a shocking move of incompetence…” or “Look, we can’t believe they’re this stupid either.”

The motion to dismiss is available in full [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/disney-ron-desantis-state-court-moot/2/).

This is remedial civil procedure and Disney’s lawyers from O’Melveny, WilmerHale, and local counsel Adam Losey cannot believe their luck getting to tee off against this one.

Or maybe DeSantis is intentionally hurling roadblocks in the way of his own case, aiming to collect all the benefits of taking a doomed stand against some vague conception of wokeness while guaranteeing that one of the state’s biggest employers ultimately comes out unscathed.

We’ve previously acknowledged [Dorsey & Whitney](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/biglaw-firm-introduces-diversity-hours-that-count-toward-associate-billable-requirements/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/care-about-biglaw-diversity-well-now-you-can-bill-for-it/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/5-concrete-steps-law-firms-can-take-to-advance-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-offer-billable-diversity-hours-for-all-timekeepers/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-25-biglaw-firm-offers-bonus-eligible-diversity-inclusion-billable-hours/), [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-5-biglaw-firm-raises-the-bar-on-billable-diversity-inclusion-hours/), [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-biglaw-firm-offers-associates-100-billables-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), [Locke Lord](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/biglaw-firm-offers-associates-75-billable-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), [Foley Hoag](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firm-offers-associates-unlimited-billable-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), [K&L Gates](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/top-50-biglaw-firm-offers-associates-50-billable-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), and [Robinson+Cole](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaw-firm-affirms-its-commitment-to-diversity-inclusion-with-new-billable-hours-policy/) as firms where approved diversity and inclusion-related work will be billable for attorneys and will count toward bonus thresholds. We now have news that an additional firm will be introducing billable credit for attorneys who log time doing work to advance diversity within the legal profession.

Stoel Rives — a firm that brought in $259,328,000 gross revenue in 2020 — is putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to its commitment to diversity and inclusion with its new billable hours policy. From the firm’s press release:

Starting November 1, 2021, lawyers will receive billable credit for up to 50 hours of approved DE&I activities performed during each 12-month period covered by Stoel’s evaluation process. The firm’s definition of diversity includes racial/ethnic minorities, lawyers who identify as LGBTQ+, lawyers with disabilities, and women. Stoel’s approved DE&I activities include:

- Attending firm-sponsored affinity bar and community and client -sponsored events that promote DE&I
- Attending external conference or educational sessions related to DE&I
- Developing and delivering presentations or training programs on DE&I topics
- Active participation in a local or national affinity bar association, on a non-profit board, or in another diversity organization
- Serving on firm-wide or office DE&I committees, working groups, or subcommittees
- Organizing or attending DE&I Committee-sponsored events
- Participating in the firm’s internal affinity groups
- Participating in Stoel’s Move the Needle activities
- Participating in recruiting efforts of diverse candidates
- Participating in mentoring, coaching, or sponsorship activities of diverse talent
- Representing Stoel at client-facing diversity events or trainings

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This is a firm that truly cares about diversity. Last month, Stoel received Mansfield Rule 4.0 Plus Certification from the Diversity Lab, meaning that the firm considers at least 30 percent diverse lawyers for leadership and governance roles, equity partner promotions, formal client pitch opportunities, and senior lateral positions. At the time of publication, 50% of the firm’s lawyers are diverse and 54% of those in the firm’s top leadership roles are diverse.

Melissa Jones, the firm’s managing partner, said of the firm’s diversity initiatives: “We have a deep, firmwide commitment to enhancing diversity and fostering a culture of inclusion, and introducing DE&I billable credit hours encourages broad engagement in our diversity mission by rewarding our lawyers for their contributions in helping achieve our goals.”

With its new diversity hours policy, the firm is doubling its annual billable credit hours to 100 hours (the firm currently allows up to 50 hours of billable credit for pro bono work). Congratulations to Stoel Rives on its firm commitment to diversity in the legal profession. What is your firm doing to support DE&I within the legal profession? Please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) to let us know.

Recently, I was fortunate to have had a chance to conduct a written interview with a prominent IP attorney, David L. Hecht, co-head of the IP Group and New York office of Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price & Hecht LLP (“Pierce Bainbridge”). I have known David for a few years, having first met him while he was on the in-house team at Vringo, which was embroiled at the time in a high-stakes patent litigation using original Lycos search engine patents against Google. In addition to his in-house experience, David practiced in the IP groups of Jones Day, Quinn Emanuel, and Steptoe & Johnson, before jumping over to the self-styled “fastest growing law firm in the world.” At the tail-end of last year, David and his clients took over the news with the lawsuits they launched against the popular video games Fortnite and NBA2K, an effort immortalized on these pages with the paean to David’s talents recorded by his rapper client, 2 Milly.

I very much welcome to opportunity to share David’s insights with this audience. Both he and his firm are at the forefront of challenging Biglaw firms with a mix of marketing bravado, entrepreneurial gusto, and old-fashioned securing of litigation wins for their clients. A winning combination so far, and one that promises to lead to more noteworthy accomplishments going forward. As usual, I have added some brief commentary to David’s answers below, but have otherwise presented his answers as he provided them.

1) What is most exciting about leading the IP group at the “fastest-growing firm in the history of the world”?

DH: The unlimited potential is really the most exciting part of leading the IP group.  When Max Price and I first approached John Pierce about launching the New York office and the IP group, I saw great potential.  John’s vision was to assemble outstanding talent from the best firms and the best law schools and unshackle them. Without red tape or politics, brilliant, hungry lawyers could excel in ways that they could never even imagine at Biglaw.  John set forth 10 “commandments” for the firm that reflect his core values:

-  All for one, one for all.
-  We don’t try cases, we win them.
-  There are only two cardinal sins — disloyalty to one another and not giving your best.
-  Every case is the entire firm’s case and the case of every lawyer in it.
-  We never give up.  There is always a way.
-  We are global missionaries for the rule of law.
-  Everyone is a rainmaker.  Everyone is a service lawyer.
-  We gang tackle, swarm, and crowd-source.  The firm is a matrix.
-  Everyone has a special gift.  Here you get to use it.
-  No one gets left behind.  Ever.
These values resonated with me.  Many of them are the antithesis of the values and culture I found during my many years at Biglaw.  Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price & Hecht LLP was designed to support every one of its lawyers and unleash their full potential.

When we joined, it felt like a giant weight had been lifted from me.  I have been able to jump on opportunities more quickly and push cases forward more aggressively than at any other firm I’ve ever worked. As a result, the firm has been able to run circles around our adversaries.  It’s clear that we have intimidated those other firms with our agility and resourcefulness.

Since launching the IP group, we’ve been retained on dozens of really fantastic matters.  Our firm’s lawsuits against Epic for copyright infringement and misappropriation of likeness in Fornite are cases of the first impression widely covered by the popular media, from the [Today Show](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__mailtrack.io_trace_link_77ebc1f65d02c243323cdfb749bca10273a0ede1-3Furl-3Dhttps-253A-252F-252Fwww.today.com-252Fpopculture-252Ffresh-2Dprince-2Dstar-2Dalfonso-2Dribeiro-2Dsues-2Dfortnite-2Duse-2Dcarlton-2Ddance-2Dt145377-253Fcid-253Dsm-5Fnpd-5Ftd-5Ffb-5Fma-26userId-3D2075968-26signature-3D8ef8901a6d12ea99&d=DwMFaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=l29Drvod1EKsseGtnAJScXZkRPICdapoRBfzehmvUms&m=crrX2rLc-bm18nYgVL-a-U7e-1uqmoTkbrM5Xmg-Ubo&s=Bceptb9pXKv8_KgX52IjknWDl4qu6bTwUfAyLBoDORs&e=) to [The Washington Post](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__mailtrack.io_trace_link_8e13a2ab953718da0b7d0df62a9b4d75b4b778c9-3Furl-3Dhttps-253A-252F-252Fwashingtonpost.com-252Fnation-252F2018-252F12-252F06-252Fis-2Dfortnite-2Dstealing-2Dblack-2Ddance-2Dculture-2Dcreator-2Dmilly-2Drock-2Dargues-2Dyes-2Dnew-2Dlawsuit-252F-26userId-3D2075968-26signature-3D13a28af244441517&d=DwMFaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=l29Drvod1EKsseGtnAJScXZkRPICdapoRBfzehmvUms&m=crrX2rLc-bm18nYgVL-a-U7e-1uqmoTkbrM5Xmg-Ubo&s=DA4DCEDuf8iOrKB9ORe0E1ap3dSWAw1n_Y-EiznkH34&e=).  We’ve recently been retained to represent Social Technologies LLC against Apple in a trademark infringement case involving the mark MEMOJI, a registered trademark owned by our client.  We are also enforcing the “King of Bling” Chris Aire’s RED GOLD® trademark against the watch and jewelry industries (after settling one of Chris’s big cases in October, I received a [Chris Aire “Capitol Hill” custom timepiece](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__mailtrack.io_trace_link_3c6dbcbd0e25142f9af2587bcb82bb65056ee422-3Furl-3Dhttps-253A-252F-252Fchrisaire.com-252Fcollections-252Fcapitol-2Dhill-252Fproducts-252Faire-2Dcapitol-2Dhill-2Dwatch-26userId-3D2075968-26signature-3D3d13595f8af0e343&d=DwMFaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=l29Drvod1EKsseGtnAJScXZkRPICdapoRBfzehmvUms&m=crrX2rLc-bm18nYgVL-a-U7e-1uqmoTkbrM5Xmg-Ubo&s=-ST5q7ljBV2YABJqH3PkiNw--tPGZqHS9ahv4bjXo1w&e=) from the RED GOLD® collection — which helped me earn mad street cred with rappers like 2 Milly and another notable rapper who is about to file suit against Epic.)

We also represent former Philadelphia Eagles player Lenwood “Skip” Hamilton in another misappropriation of likeness case against both Epic Games and Microsoft.  On the patent side, we have several big patent infringement cases, including cases against Samsung, DJI, and Xiaomi.

We’ve also attracted top-tier talent to the firm.  The newest additions to our IP group are two former Kramer Levin senior partners: Brian Slater, our new Head of Life Sciences, and Greg Sephton.  Brian and Greg are first-chair patent litigators with phenomenal experience. It’s an honor to have them on the team. Our IP group now has talent and capability spanning the complete breadth of IP.

As our IP group has expanded to the point that we rival the size and capabilities of the most-respected IP groups in the country, Fortune 500 work has been steadily flowing to our firm.  Choosing Pierce Bainbridge is a no-brainer for GCs: we provide the same talent as they would find at our Biglaw competition (our firm consists of almost exclusively Biglaw expats), for drastically less cost.  Since we are fixated on world domination, we also want to ensure our clients keep coming back. So, we strive to provide the best possible services to our clients to ensure that they are not only happy with our rates but thrilled with the results we are obtaining for them.

GK: Hard to add much to the above, other than to say that David’s experience mirrors my own after leaving Biglaw to join an IP boutique. With the right moxie and dedication to client service, there really does not need to be a drop in the quality of matters one handles. In fact, the flexibility of a boutique environment can often be a catalyst for taking on higher-profile matters sooner.

2) How has your business background helped prepare you for your current role?

DH: My background in business is really what helped the most, both educationally and in practice.  Before law school, I pursued my MBA while working full-time as a network engineer. It was one of the best decisions I ever made.  Foundational business courses like accounting, marketing, and organizational behavior should really be required coursework for law students.  Those courses have certainly helped me in my role as co-head of the IP group at Pierce Bainbridge. They have also helped me relate to and understand my clients and their business requirements.  

But even those business courses can’t teach you everything you need to know.  Much of what I have learned over the years has come from the School of Hard Knocks.  I came from humble beginnings. My father was a public school teacher and my mother was a homemaker; we were always on a tight budget when I was growing up.  I became a lawyer because I was always fascinated with patent law: the intersection between science/engineering and the humanities. I was also led to believe that a smart lawyer who went to a great school and worked at a top firm would have some job security.  But that was wrong. I saw blood in the water during the Great Recession and watched as my former classmates were axed from even the most “elite” Biglaw firms.

At that point, I realized that I needed to look out for myself.  As I continued to scavenge for work at the firm I was working at, I also started leveraging my hefty Biglaw salary and began investing in real estate in my spare time, establishing a real estate investment company as other startups.  I created a safety net for myself and my family. Since I was lucky enough to find enough legal work and weathered the storm, I never left the practice of law and continued doing what I love the most: advocating for my clients and gearing up for the next trial.  But I will never forget the apprehension of potentially losing my job and possibly even my career.

My experiences sourcing and identifying deals, project managing, setting up financing, as well as hiring and delegating so that I could focus on high-level aspects of the businesses, directly impact my roles at the firm today.  The apprehension that led me to start-up my own businesses a decade ago never faded; the fear that tough times may be just around the corner now also what drives me to continuously hunt for new business opportunities at Pierce Bainbridge.

John Pierce and most of my partners are just as ravenous as I am.  That hunger is important to the mission.  We must be relentless and focused to overtake firms like Quinn Emanuel and the old guard. My focus is no longer on looking out for myself as I did a decade ago.  I am looking out for the firm and my colleagues; I am constantly seeking out lucrative cases and good clients.

Lawyers should realize that the practice of law is also a business; unfortunately, most firms are simply incapable of teaching young lawyers how to market themselves and seldom let anyone peek behind the curtain.  At Pierce Bainbridge, there are no secrets and there is no curtain. We bring in business through sheer force of will. Everyone who wants to become a rainmaker can do so.

GK: What shines through in David’s answer is the absolute lack of entitlement. As the saying goes, “hungry dogs run faster,” and nothing is as motivating as someone’s desire to provide for their family and gain some control over their financial destiny.

We will continue with David’s answer to question 3 next week.

# Biglaw Chair Dies After Taking Leave For Exhaustion
## Sad news.

Late last year, Baker McKenzie global chair Paul Rawlinson stepped away from his position at the firm to [take a leave of absence citing exhaustion](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/global-chair-of-biglaw-firm-taking-temporary-leave-due-to-exhaustion/). Sadly, [Rawlinson has passed away](https://www.law.com/2019/04/15/baker-mckenzie-global-chair-dies-405-35159/).

At the time of his leave, we focused on then-recent struggles at the firm with an inquiry into the firm’s handling of sexual harassment complaints and internal dissension over associate pay as aggravating factors in wearing down an attorney charged with managing one of the largest global firms. His stepping away forced us all to take a hard look at the [systemic pressures Biglaw places upon all attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/burnout-flame-out-or-timeout/) and especially those at the top.

With Rawlinson’s passing, it’s worth revisiting all of these concerns and reflecting on what can be done to make the Biglaw model a more hospitable work environment.

Jaime Trujillo Caicedo, based out of Colombia, has served as interim chair for the last several months and will remain in this role until a permanent successor is named.

Our deepest sympathies go out to Rawlinson’s loved ones and the Baker McKenzie family at large.

Judge Olu Stevens

* Judge Olu Stevens, who famously said he would not “check his First Amendment rights at the courthouse door,” will be dropping his suit against the Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission. He remains charged with six counts of misconduct related to public comments made about the exclusion of black jurors. [[WDRB](http://www.wdrb.com/story/32686255/louisville-judge-olu-stevens-drops-federal-lawsuit-against-state)]

* Four partners from Cadwalader — including Rick Rule, who serves as managing partner of the firm’s D.C. office, head of the firm’s antitrust practice, and chair of the firm’s litigation department — will be departing to join Paul Weiss. A start date has not been announced, but he’ll serve as co-chair of PW’s antitrust group. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/top-d-c-antitrust-lawyers-to-leave-cadwalader-source/)]

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

* The DOJ says it won’t make changes to the regulatory agreements governing music licensing giants ASCAP and BMI, but will require them to offer “100 percent licensing” of their songs, which could get messy for songs with multiple writers. The music industry has one year to comply with the new requirements. [[DealBook / New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/business/media/how-a-justice-department-ruling-could-affect-your-favorite-musician.html)]

* According to a ruling from the Eighth Circuit which overturned a lower court decision, the National Football League’s 2014 suspension of Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson for his involvement in a child abuse case was within the organization’s rights. The NFLPA disagrees with the decision, but won’t further appeal. [[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/nfl-peterson-idUSL1N1AL1CP)]

* Colton Harris-Moore, a man who is perhaps better known as the “Barefoot Bandit” for his cross-country crime spree involving the theft of boats, planes, and other luxury items, will soon be released from prison. What will he do when he gets out? He’ll be working part-time at his lawyer’s firm as a clerk as he looks for a full-time job.

# Fake Emergencies Are A Real Problem

 Thoughts: You have no idea how much I wanted to drop everything on my Sunday morning to take care of your fake emergency!

 Words: “No worries! How can I help you?”

 Every lawyer, definitely in-house lawyer, had this experience at least once!

‍ Educating your clients about the definition of “emergency” is a solid investment. I like starting with [Black’s Law Dictionary](https://thelawdictionary.org/emergency/).

 Stay strong. Do not carve out exceptions and exceptions to the exceptions. Resist the urge!

‍ That is how you don’t moonlight as a firefighter on your nights and weekend!

[](https://emojis.wiki/question-mark/) How do you respond, if at all, to that fake emergency call on Sunday morning?

Rankings season is upon us, and many publications are rolling out their best offerings for readers’ perusal in advance of the release of the 2023 U.S. News & World Report Law School Rankings.

For more than a decade, Law.com has published a list of the best law schools to go to if you want to work in Biglaw after graduation. Law.com refers to these institutions of higher education as the “go-to law schools,” and this year, they’re ranked by the percentage of 2021 graduates who took associate positions at the 100 largest law firms based on attorney head count.

Before we get to the list of the go-to law schools, it’s worthwhile to speak about the landscape for entry-level employment in the legal profession. Despite the pandemic, the class of 2021 actually did quite well when it came to securing Biglaw jobs. If you recall from our prior coverage, their success was [historic](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/biglaw-firms-score-with-historic-offer-and-acceptance-rates-for-summer-associate-recruitment/):

According to the latest recruiting figures from the National Association for Law Placement (NALP), offer rates from Biglaw summer programs remained close to historic highs, with 97% of second-year law students receiving offers for full-time employment as associates after graduation. Acceptances of those offers reached an all-time, historic high of 89%. What’s even more exciting is that this historic acceptance rate is significantly higher than acceptance rates measured before the Great Recession, which tended to hover between 73 to 77 percent.

That said, things are going great for the Top 10 Go-To Law Schools:

- Columbia: 64%
- Penn: 60%
- Cornell: 56%
- Northwestern: 52%
- Duke: 51%
- NYU: 51%
- UVA: 48%
- UC Berkeley: 45%
- U. Chicago: 45%
- Harvard: 41%

You can access the full list of the Top 50 Go-To Law Schools by clicking [here](https://www.law.com/2022/03/13/the-2022-top-50-go-to-law-schools/).

With 64 percent of its graduates heading to Biglaw firms after graduation, Columbia has ruled this ranking for the past nine years. The top five schools look a little different from last year’s ranking, in that there was a lot of flip-flopping among Northwestern, Penn, and Cornell, with Duke sneaking its way in by employing just a few more of its graduates in Biglaw than NYU (which slipped down to No. 6). It’s worth mentioning the fact that clerkship placements aren’t considered in this ranking, which is likely the reason why Stanford and Yale are both chilling at No. 20 and No. 23 on the list (both big drops from last year, down from No. 13 and No. 16, respectively).

Law.com also has a list of [“Firm Favorites,”](https://www.law.com/2022/03/13/2022-go-to-law-schools-firm-favorites/) noting the law schools that specific firms recruited most heavily from. Here are some highlights from that list:

Cravath: Columbia (17)
Davis Polk: Columbia (24)
Debevoise: Columbia; NYU (22 each)
Kirkland: U. Chicago (17)
Latham: Georgetown (17)
Ropes & Gray: Boston U. (29)
Skadden: Harvard (19)

Perhaps even more notable than these numbers are the tuition figures appended to this year’s rankings. Law school costs versus employment percentages can vary greatly. Unless you’re tied to a specific location, why pay ~$69,000 to go to a school that sends 40 percent of its graduates to Biglaw when you can spend ~$38,000 less to go to a school that sends about the same percentage of its graduates to Biglaw?

# Biglaw Firm Announces New Salaries, But Performance Evaluations Could Put A Damper On Raises
## Associates at this firm better hope they're up to snuff!

Yet another firm has hopped aboard the good ship DPW, with bountiful raises to share with associates — if they’re on track with billables and meeting performance expectations, of course.

This news comes from Hunton Andrews Kurth, a firm that landed at No. 61 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, with $743,100,000 gross revenue in 2020. It seems that the firm is in the middle of its annual evaluations, and is currently working with its prior salary scale to do so. Any salary adjustments for the review period will occur at the end of June, retroactive to April 1. Hunton will evaluate the new salary scale for further adjustments at the end of July, retroactive to July 1.

Here’s what the new salary scale looks like at Hunton:

# The Family Renovation Project: A Blueprint For Integrating Legal Teams In AI Initiatives
## Collaboration, communication, and a holistic approach to projects, whether in a family or corporate environment, yields winning results.

My family embarked on a comprehensive home renovation project a few summers ago. It was a massive undertaking that required the skills and input of every family member, each bringing their unique expertise to the table. This collective effort, filled with challenges and collaborations, became a powerful analogy for the importance of integrating legal teams into organization-wide AI projects.

The Home As An Organization, Family As The Legal Team

Understanding Each Room’s Role

Picture the home as an organization, with each room serving a specific function. Now, imagine the legal team ensuring that the renovation plans for each department are legally sound and practically feasible — like having a legal blueprint for every nook and cranny.

Balancing Aesthetics With Safety

Aesthetic charm combined with safety was our mantra for the home. Similarly, in AI projects, legal teams play the role of safety inspectors, ensuring compliance and risk management while the organization seeks aesthetic innovation.

Laying The Foundation: Preparing For Integration

Gathering Insights And Expectations

Like family meetings before a renovation, involving legal teams early in AI projects aligns everyone with organizational goals.

Identifying Risks And Compliance Needs

Renovating an old electrical system required understanding safety standards — similarly, the legal team identifies potential risks and compliance requirements in AI implementations.

Building Together: The Process Of Integration

Collaborative Design Sessions

Picture everyone huddled around a table with sketches — legal teams should be part of AI brainstorming sessions, offering insights on legal implications and risk assessment.

Regular Communication And Updates

Just as a smoothly run renovation requires constant updates, ongoing communication between the legal team and other departments ensures the seamless integration of AI technologies.

Adapting To Unforeseen Challenges

Unforeseen challenges are inevitable in renovations and AI projects alike. Legal teams play a vital role in navigating these challenges.

The Legal Team’s Unique Contributions

Ensuring Compliance And Ethical Standards

Like ensuring structural integrity in renovations, legal teams ensure adherence to legal and ethical standards in AI projects.

Risk Assessment And Mitigation

Legal teams’ expertise in risk assessment is like understanding the load-bearing walls in a renovation — crucial for the project’s overall safety and success.

Contractual Agreements With Vendors

Much like dealing with contractors and suppliers, legal teams manage contracts and agreements with AI technology vendors and partners.

Lessons Learned From The Renovation

The Value Of Diverse Perspectives

Our renovation thrived on diverse family perspectives, just like legal teams enrich AI projects with diverse insights.

Flexibility And Adaptability

Adapting our renovation plans was key, just as legal teams in AI projects must be flexible and adaptable.

Importance of a Shared Vision

A shared vision guided our renovation, like how a unified goal guides organization-wide AI initiatives.

The Impact On Our Home And Organization

A Home That Reflects All Of Us

The renovated home reflected each family member’s input and care — AI projects, with legal team involvement, result in innovative, compliant solutions that are aligned with organizational values.

Building A Blueprint For Future Projects

Our renovation gave us a blueprint for the future — integrating legal teams in AI projects sets a precedent for future technology initiatives.

A Model For Collaborative Innovation

In conclusion, like our family renovation project, integrating legal teams in organization-wide AI projects brings together different expertise and perspectives for a common goal. It’s about balancing innovation with compliance, risk management with operational efficiency, and technology with human insight.

This experience taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and a holistic approach to projects, whether in a family or corporate environment. It showed that when legal teams are involved in AI initiatives, they add value through their specialized knowledge and ensure that the projects are aligned with the organization’s broader objectives and ethical standards. In the end, just like a well-renovated home, a well-executed AI project, with the involvement of legal expertise, stands as a testament to the power of collaborative effort, foresight, and balanced decision-making.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Inside Look At Biglaw Diversity Efforts
## A look at what works, and what just doesn't.

In this episode, I speak with [Renauld Clarke](https://brownrudnick.com/people/renauld-clarke/), Director of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion at Brown Rudnick, about the biggest diversity challenges in Biglaw. Renauld discusses the most relevant benchmarks for diversity in the legal profession, and why he launched the Racial Justice Initiative. He also shares how he is approaching recruitment and retention given the intensity of the lateral market right now.



The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!


Kathryn Rubino is a Senior Editor at Above the Law, host of [The Jabot podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/1XC11QhFCWxWr4NQrk2sEA), and co-host of [Thinking Like A Lawyer](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/).

# Top 5 Reasons Senior Associates Should Consider 'Under Top Am Law 200 Firms'

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://bit.ly/2KxFPa6) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelallen/) is the CEO of Lateral Link. He is based in the Los Angeles office and focuses exclusively on Partner and General Counsel placements for top firms and companies. Prior to founding Lateral Link in 2006, he worked as an attorney at both Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Irell & Manella LLP. Michael graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, San Diego before earning his JD, cum laude, from Harvard Law School.

From cars and watches to wine and shoes, we are all brand conscious.   The same goes for law firms, which we rank in terms of profits, size, leverage, offices, and the like.  At some point, however, senior associates may want to really think about their next steps because they oftentimes face an important decision in this stage of their career that will shape the remainder lives as legal professionals.   The decision is usually threefold:  i) make a run for partner at my current mega firm (albeit outside your control); ii) look for partnership elsewhere (likely “under top Am Law 200 firms”); or iii) go in-house (which is a timely process, and you may not have all that much time remaining).

1. There is a Vibrant Market. There are approximately the same number of opportunities within the top “Am Law 200” and “under the Am Law 200.”   Courtesy of Leopard Solutions, here is the “Lateral Report” by practice area over the prior rolling 12 months for firms ranking under the Am Law 200.   As you can see, there is a lot movement in the firms ranking under the top Am Law 200.   Of importance, there were around 1,200 lateral partner moves.    My first point is that there is a market to explore.   The next several points address the why.

Practice Area	Associate	Partner	Counsel	Total
Total	4314	1468	1162	6944
BANKING	25	14	13	52
BANKRUPTCY	46	39	10	95
CORPORATE	342	177	130	649
ENERGY	44	12	16	72
ENVIRONMENT	42	25	15	82
ERISA-C&B	14	15	16	45
GENERAL PRACTICE	19	8	6	33
GOVERNMENT	60	30	40	130
HEALTHCARE	55	49	41	145
INSURANCE	153	30	23	206
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY	204	115	112	431
LABOR & EMPLOYMENT	341	91	73	505
LITIGATION	2532	668	472	3672
REAL ESTATE	251	111	88	450
TAX	57	27	38	122
TRANSPORTATION	7	4	6	17
TRUSTS & ESTATES	114	53	63	230
UNASSIGNED	8	0	0	8
Total	4314	1468	1162	6944
2. Bill Rate Flexibility. Firms are businesses, and the billable hour is their source of income (unless on contingency of course).   Firms expect their partners to remain productive, and by that, they want to see them bring in their own work and staff it with an associate or two when possible. Senior associates at mega firms who have rates above $800 / hour and who haven’t made partner have a great story to tell to their contacts if they go to a firm with lower and flexible rates.  g., say a Cravath senior associate isn’t going to make partner and he moves to a firm where he could bill out at $400 / hour.  That’s a great pitch to capture the clients who the Cravath-trained attorney did a great job on billion-dollar deals (and reposition their value to source the middle market work at a discount).

3. Referral Work. We see it all the time.   Senior associates who leave their Am Law 200 firm to go to a non-competitor oftentimes receive referral work from their former colleagues.   A lot of work gets turned away because either the client doesn’t want to pay the big rates for less complex work, or another way to say it, the firm prices itself out of the market.   And there are always conflict reasons too.    Either way, we see senior associates make this source of referral business a primary one to start their practice.   My advice: stay in the good graces of your former colleagues.   They will take care of you if you move to a firm seen as a non-competitor.   If you move to a peer firm, you shouldn’t expect much in terms of referral work from you former colleagues.

4. Lower Threshold to Earn the “Partner” Title.   Although titles aren’t everything, they are very important to generate business.   It’s a chicken and the egg dilemma.   At a major Am Law 100 firm, you shouldn’t just expect to make “partner” unless you’re in a good situation (such as hot practice area with few others in your class vying for the spot, succession planning, you brought in a big client or a major firm client really wants you on their work, your uncle is head of a sovereign wealth fund, and the like).   It’s an uphill battle for “senior associates” at major Am Law firms to win business given their title.   You have to explain away who else is supervising the work even though you’re likely the one who handling it.   A title matters in the legal profession. It signals credibility, recognition, and ability.

5. You Have No Choice. This last reason isn’t a bad one.  It’s just reality.   If you want to build your own practice, the best way to achieve success is out performing your peers in the market and maintaining a solid reputation (and all at a good value).   Say your firm no longer needs your services and you are asked to leave.   The next step is to figure out where to go: in-house or another firm that values your contribution.   Say you pitch yourself as a Cravath-trained attorney but now with a partner title and a LinkedIn bio that explains pedigree all at half the price from your former colleagues.  Most of the Am Law 200 firms understand who they are and their position in the market.     They look for talented senior associates with fire in the belly who have potential to bring in $500-750k in their first year or so and will make them partner.

My colleagues at Lateral Link are great at pinpointing opportunities and knowing where they exist for senior associates looking to make partner at firms under the Am Law 200.   It’s actually a great feeling when you can build a practice, control your career, and leverage all your prior achievements and experience to maintain a stable and profitable practice.    Feel free to reach out to one of my colleagues in your region to discuss strategy.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

The Biglaw firm of Fox Rothschild has been very busy, filing an astonishing 448 copyright lawsuits in the third quarter of 2018. [According to data collected by Lex Machina](https://www.law360.com/articles/1095489) and reported by Law360, the majority of those lawsuits have been illegal downloading cases filed on behalf of the adult film studio, Strike 3 Holdings. In fact, the firm has filed the most copyright cases in each of the last four quarters, usually with Strike 3 as their client.

As you might imagine, it is unusual to see a respected Biglaw firm top the list of attorneys filing copyright lawsuits, which are overwhelmingly suits against John Doe porn downloaders. This is particularly true after the scandal surrounding notorious porn troll, [Prenda Law](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/prenda-law/). The founder of that law firm [pleaded guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/porn-lawyer-pleads-guilty/) to a massive extortion scheme based on mass-filed copyright cases. And that case has hung over the work Fox Rothschild is doing:

In June, a Seattle federal judge asked Fox Rothschild attorneys why they shouldn’t face sanctions over their conduct in one Strike 3 case. The attorneys responded by addressing “the elephant in the room,” saying Strike Three is “the anti-Prenda” and that the company does not have a “litigation business model.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Still, the number of cases Strike 3 has filed in 2018 — 1,653 to be exact — has been staggering (the company has used Fox Rothschild as well as smaller firms as counsel in these suits). And it’s a far cry from the 228 lawsuits they filed in 2017.

What’s your firm doing during the COVID-19 crisis?

We’ve reported (extensively) on all the bad ish that’s happening (all the [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/), [furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-furloughs-associates-firm-hopeful-they-can-return-to-work-soon/), and [salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/associates-facing-25-percent-pay-cut-at-am-law-200-firm/) we know about), but we are also trying to make time for some of the bright spots — like [the assurances associates won’t be fired](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/biglaw-firm-assures-associates-they-will-not-cut-salaries-or-furlough-lawyers/). And when we let you know litigation boutique Hueston Hennigan was [handing out tech budgets](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/prestigious-firm-bucking-the-covid-19-austerity-trend-with-special-bonuses-and-tech-budgets/) to make sure this whole working from home thing went smoothly, Biglaw folks wanted to make sure we knew they weren’t the only ones.

Thus far tipsters from the following Biglaw firms have lets us know about the COVID-19 tech stipends:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Skadden:

In addition to not indicating any impending negative measures — at least not yet — they have initiated a firmwide technology reimbursement to set all attorneys up with tech for home offices.  The tech includes a new laptop, two monitors, wireless keyboard/mouse, and a printer (with toner and paper).  Pretty nice, especially considering the circumstances.

Fried Frank (payable to all special counsel, associates and staff):

[T]he Firm will be providing a one-time stipend of $350 to be paid in paychecks dated April 15, 2020. The stipend is non-taxable and is to be used for technology expenses associated with enabling employees to work from home, including the costs for monitors, printers, scanners, shredders and related supplies purchased on or after March 13, 2020

Debevoise:

Debevoise also gave a $500 tech allowance to associates payable on the first April check.

Willkie:

No tech stipend from Willkie, but they were proactive from day 1 offering to ship to associates any office tech – monitors, printers, keyboards, mouse, Cisco phones, and any other accessories – we’d need.

Milbank gave all associates and special counsel a $750 tech stipend to improve their home offices.

White & Case:

White and case has also been really proactive about getting people everything they need directly, plus a 250 tech stipend for anything that’s easier for you to source yourself. They have offices in a lot of hard hit locations and have been incredible about supporting attorneys and staff so far.

# Thanks To Biglaw's Hot Lateral Market, The End Of The 5-Day, In-Office Work Week Is Here
## Biglaw firms that want to stay on top need to offer more remote flexibility.

The end of the five-day, in-office work has finally arrived. Who would’ve thought that we’d have COVID to thank for it.

The pandemic has proven that a physical brick-and-mortar office is no longer an essential when it comes to the practice of law. Associates know it, and partners know it too, but they’ve got real estate leases to pay, so the office beckons as an absolute must for important things like mentorship and professional development. Another thing associates now know — especially highly in-demand midlevel associates — is that if they don’t like their firm’s in-office working policies, they can leave and head to a firm that has the remote or hybrid flexibilities they’re looking for in a snap.

The [Daily Business Review](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2021/10/29/competition-for-legal-talent-drives-nail-into-coffin-of-five-day-in-office-work-week/) provides a bird’s-eye on this new phenomenon:

According to South Florida legal recruiters like Joe Ankus of Ankus Consulting, law firms that can’t provide a compelling reason to ask everyone to show up five days per week are at a disadvantage—so, most aren’t.

“I would say at least half of the candidates I speak to either asked me whether remote work is an option when things return to normal, and the other half have said to me that they would prefer to be in the office three to four days per week,” Ankus said. “The remote option remains highly in favor among lawyers with three to seven years of experience.”

“I hear it every day from attorneys. Out of 10 [conversations], remote flexibility comes up at least six or seven times,” said Miami-based legal recruiter Chris Holtzhauer of Holtz & Bernard, during a chat with [DBR](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2021/10/29/competition-for-legal-talent-drives-nail-into-coffin-of-five-day-in-office-work-week/). “Some firms that are still hesitant to give that flexibility, who want people to be in-office because they’re fearful of how remote work affects their culture, those firms are having a tough time being competitive.”

If firms don’t want to have a “tough time being competitive,” they better be sure to put more remote work options on the table. After all, aside from more money, it’s what the midlevels they need really want most for their careers.

# Top 25 Biglaw Firm Makes Another Salary Move
## The firm knows how to keep associates happy.

Biglaw is in the middle of a hot lateral market. That means that firms have to be willing to pay the tippy top of market compensation ([plus other perks](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-firm-to-pick-up-the-tab-for-your-next-vacay/)) to recruit and retain the associates that keep the deals/cases moving.

Goodwin Procter — a firm making $1,486,263,000 in 2020 gross revenue, making it 23rd on the Am Law 100 — already announced raises [way back in January ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/good-news-for-associates-as-goodwin-matches-salary-hike/)when the Milbank scale was the top of the market. Of course, since then both Davis Polk and Cravath have taken a crack at raises, and now that higher Cravath scale is what’s holding sway. And now that the dust seems to have settled, Goodwin is raising salaries again.

The new scale at the firm is as follows:

Salary Class

Annual Base Salary Effective January 1, 2022
(Increases reflected in March 2022 Pay)

2021

$215,000

2020

$225,000

2019

$250,000

2018

$295,000

2017

$345,000

2016

$370,000

2015

$400,000

2014+

$415,000

 

These increases are also retroactive to January 1. You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/goodwin-re-raises-22/2/)

# Rescission Watch: Which Biglaw Firm Is Pulling Offers?
## Which firm is making its would-be associates scramble for new jobs? Could it be yours?

‘Why? Why?! Whyyyyyyyyy???!!!’

If you recall, back in the darkest days of the recession, we covered the topic of rescinded offers quite frequently. Now that things are looking brighter for the legal profession, it’s a rare occurrence.

But not today. That brings us to today’s Biglaw blind item.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Word on the street is that an international firm has decided to rescind offers of full-time employment for almost all of its incoming associates. The firm that’s left would-be associates in the lurch has sustained a slew of partner departures in its corporate ranks in recent weeks. While the Silver Circle firm said it expected to expand its offerings on the East Coast following those departures, we’re now hearing that external recruiters have been calling other Am Law 100 firms to ask if they’d be interested in hiring fall associates as offers have been withdrawn for almost all of the offending firm’s incoming first-years.

Which firm would dare to pull offers so late in the game?

We might do more about this — and even reveal the name of the firm in question — if we can obtain additional details and corroboration. If you have solid and specific information, please feel free to [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Rescinded%20Offers) or text us (646-820-8477). As regular readers know, we keep our sources anonymous. Thank you for any info you might be able to share on this firm that’s screwing young associates.

# Women Associates More Satisfied With Their Biglaw Jobs In Post-Pandemic World
## This is unexpected...

The coronavirus pandemic has changed the modern workplace as we know it, pushing lawyers into working from the safety of their homes instead of commuting to offices where they may contract an illness that’s caused more than 100,000 deaths in America thus far. Law firms themselves have had to adjust to this new reality, slashing pay, furloughing employees, and even conducting layoffs to come out on the other side of the virus alive.

You’d think that in this often hectic environment, Biglaw associates would be less satisfied with their jobs — especially given the fact that many of them are now working without any childcare whatsoever — but according to a new survey, women associates’ satisfaction has climbed to new heights. How could this be?

According to BTI Consulting, which interviewed and surveyed 369 law firm associates before and during the pandemic, women are responsible for a 12 percent uptick in overall associate job satisfaction, while men’s satisfaction remained unchanged.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being extremely satisfied and 1, representing you are ready to leave: 

Pre-Pandemic	Post-Pandemic
Overall Associate Satisfaction	7.4	7.9
Women Associates	7.0	7.9
Men Associates	7.9	7.9
What’s driving women’s newfound satisfaction with their jobs during the pandemic? According to the survey, Biglaw firms are showing more empathy to their employees, which is ranked higher by women in importance than men. Firms are also giving their associates some breathing room during these tumultuous times, giving them 10 to 15 percent wiggle room in their billable hour targets, which ranked higher for women associates than men. From the survey:

Law firms did a good job of delivering on associates’ high expectations for how they would be treated and how well-informed they would be. Men have the same concerns but value these behaviors differently than women associates – resulting in the surge.

Let’s see if law firms are able to keep these satisfaction rates up when it’s time for associates to head back to the office. For some reason, we have our doubts.

Today, we must report on some unfortunate news from California, where a partner of Sidley Austin’s Los Angeles office was found dead on Sunday. Authorities believe that the cause of death is suicide.

[Gabriel MacConaill](https://www.sidley.com/en/people/m/macconaill-gabriel-r), a 2005 graduate of the Dickinson Law School at Pennsylvania State University, was known as a restructuring expert and had recently secured a lead role in Mattress Firm’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner, MacConaill died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

A spokeswoman from the firm released this statement on MacConaills’s death:

Do you suffer from the curse of competence?

Be flattered, not frustrated.

Suppose you can write. There’s an outside chance that people will notice your skill. All of a sudden, you’ll be asked to write everything.

You’ll have briefs coming out of your ears. You’ll be ghost-writing articles for the senior guys. You’ll be asked to take a look at every policy, or procedure, or piece of pablum going out of the joint. You’ll be editing stuff that you didn’t know existed.

There will be a set of 1,000 cases. One will be heading to trial. You’ll have been working like a dog on those cases, and you’ll want to play a speaking role at trial. You’ll propose just that.

“No,” you’ll be told. “You can’t go to trial! You’re the only one who can write briefs. We can’t spare you! What would happen to all the motions and appeals if you spent three weeks pinned down at a trial site?”

You curse. You scratch your head. You wonder: “Am I being punished for being competent? I don’t simply write more clearly than the other folks at this joint. I also do better cross-examinations than the clowns who are attending the trial. But I’m being deprived of the good opportunity because the other folks are incompetent to handle brief-writing? Where’s the justice in that?”

You’re right — there is no justice in that.

You’re suffering from the curse of competence.

The curse of competence doesn’t afflict only good writers. It can also afflict, for example, the few people who actually do things.

“Do things”; I typed that right. If you’re asked to do something, you do it. Without complaining. On time. And more or less right.

Batten down the hatches! There’s rough weather ahead!

If you actually do things, on time and right, you’ve probably just set yourself apart from 95 percent of the rest of humanity. This will make you a very popular guy (or gal).

Does anything need doing? You’ll be the one!

No one is coordinating the 15 cases? Let’s ask the competent person to handle that. It may not be the role she prefers, but at least we’ll have someone we trust at the helm.

The document review is going poorly? Let’s ask the competent person to oversee it! Maybe she can fix things.

The computer crashed? The photocopier jammed? Someone spilled the coffee? Call the person who actually does things! That person will handle it!

This is the curse of competence. Work lands on your desk not because the work will challenge or interest you, but only because other folks trust you to handle it.

(Here’s a military analogy: During the Vietnam War, someone had to be the “[point man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_point),” taking the lead, and most exposed, position, as an infantry unit moved through the jungle. The point man would also often be the first person exposed to hostile fire. Vietnam vets have told me that they had to be very careful when serving on the point: You had to perform the duty sufficiently well to survive your stint, but not so impressively well that you’d be asked to do it again. If you performed the duty too well, you’d suffer the curse of competence: You’d be asked to take point again, which could shorten your time [from cradle to tomb](https://play.google.com/music/preview/Tbk65o733nv4fjvlno27fffj74q?lyrics=1&utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=lyrics&pcampaignid=kp-lyrics).)

Although I’ve made light of it here, the curse of competence is a real affliction. I’ve seen people suffer from it, and it’s a hard curse to exorcise. The competent person may be asked to do too much work, or too much tedious work, or too much of the same work, simply because everyone knows that the competent one will do it right. Why risk disaster when you can rely on the known quantity?

If you’re afflicted by the curse of competence, what can you do?

First, recognize this for what it is — the sincerest form of flattery. People may not tell you that they’re saddling you with work because they trust you, but they are. And being trusted is far better than simply being told that you’re trusted.

At the same time, gently cast out the demon. Mention to the person who’s unfairly burdening you that, although you’re delighted to help, you have many skills, and you’d like to use all of them, rather than the ones that are attracting attention. Explain that it’s not fair to leave you pinned down at home because you write great briefs, while the crappy brief-writers trot off to the trial site.

A supervisor who trusts you — and who demonstrates that trust in action, rather than words — will probably both understand your concern and fear losing you. (You are, after all, the competent one. That’s a scarce commodity, not easily replaced.) Once you point out the problem, the supervisor will probably come to your aid.

Do you suffer from the curse of competence? Be flattered!

But speak up. Folks may not realize what they’re unfairly doing to you. Once you point it out, your world may well improve.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It’s all-consuming. Student debt lives and breathes with you every day. Folks have been waiting for relief for so long, only to have the goal post moved.

— [Josephine Bahn](https://www.cozen.com/people/bios/bahn-josephine), an associate at Cozen O’Connor in Washington, D.C., who chairs the American Bar Association’s Young Lawyers Division, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/young-lawyers-hit-by-us-supreme-court-rejection-of-debt-relief) on the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan. In what she calls a “fight or flight decision,” Bahn recently decided to pay down her six-figure student debt instead of saving for retirement.

Happy spring! And despite our still-challenging times, there are things to celebrate.

A year ago today, I was still in the hospital with a severe case of COVID-19. This March was much, much better: my big news for the month is that I received both doses of Pfizer’s new COVID vaccine. I experienced some side effects – fatigue, aches, chills – but they’re much better than the alternative. I’m glad and grateful to be vaccinated, and I urge you to get vaccinated when you can if you haven’t been vaccinated already.

The sooner we all get vaccinated, the sooner we can return to some semblance of normalcy. And there are already signs that we’re starting to turn the corner. Law firms and in-house legal departments are making tentative plans to return to the office – and because so many of them are so busy, they’re ramping up their hiring. Here are just a few of the exciting opportunities that we’re handling here at [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/):

1. A remote business-side role. If you’re a lawyer or law school graduate looking to transition over to the business side while still making use of your legal education and experience, here’s a great opportunity. An innovative and rapidly growing ed tech company, a recognized leader in bringing digital learning to the legal industry, is looking for a Manager of Law School Engagement. This new role provides an exciting opportunity to use a range of skills – including relationship management, business strategy, and sales and marketing – to help the company grow, to help law students become more practice-ready, and to help law professors develop new methods of teaching that incorporate the company’s offerings.

The role offers the chance to make a big contribution to a growing business, a competitive salary, equity in a thriving company, top-notch health insurance, and a 401(k) with employer matching. A law degree is required, and experience at either a Biglaw firm or in sales and marketing is a plus. Because the company is remote, the candidate can sit anywhere in the country. This job search is being handled exclusively by Lateral Link.

2. An amazing appellate opportunity. One of the world’s top law firms is looking to hire a third- to fourth-year associate to join its Supreme Court and appellate practice. This role offers an incredible opportunity to work on premier appellate matters with one of the nation’s leading SCOTUS advocates, and it’s also geographically flexible. While D.C. would be preferred, the new hire could also sit in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and a number of other major markets – making this the rare opportunity to engage in Supreme Court and appellate practice without living in Washington.

Requirements: a stellar academic record in law school, a SCOTUS clerkship or a clerkship with a leading federal appellate judge, and class of 2017-2018. (I mentioned this opportunity in a prior newsletter. Since then, the group has hired one fairly senior associate, so it’s now looking at the more junior level – and there isn’t much flexibility here.)

3. A capital markets role with a decent lifestyle. If you’re a midlevel to senior capital markets associate, you have no shortage of opportunities right now. But because cap markets is so busy, most of those opportunities involve working extremely long hours. If you focus on capital markets/securities work for public companies but also want to have a life outside of work, we are currently working with an Am Law 200 firm that boasts interesting work, an international orientation, a highly collegial environment – and yes, reasonable hours.

4. A securities litigation boutique with stand-up opportunities. For litigation associates with three to four years of Biglaw experience, a plaintiff-side securities litigation boutique in New York is looking to hire. The work is interesting, dynamic, and fast-paced; you won’t be stuck on these giant Biglaw cases that drag on for five or 10 years. Expect to have stand-up opportunities, such as arguing motions, very soon after arriving. Prior securities experience or a demonstrated interest in securities work is strongly preferred.

5. Litigation boutiques more generally. Outside the securities space, a number of elite litigation boutiques seek associates with strong academic records from top schools, one or two federal clerkships, and one to two years of experience at a top Biglaw firm (but generally not more than that; the window for lateraling as a litigator is earlier than it used to be). Compared to their Biglaw counterparts, boutiques offer smaller and often more collegial environments, more responsibility at an earlier stage of your career, and enhanced partnership prospects. If you have the credentials discussed above, graduated from law school in 2017-2019, and might be interested in learning more about top boutiques, please contact us.

If any of these opportunities sound appealing, please feel free to reach out [to me](https://www.laterallink.com/team/david-lat/) or any of [my colleagues](https://www.laterallink.com/team/) to discuss possible opportunities. We look forward to hearing from you.

# Leading Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries For All U.S. Associates

Based off what [Covington & Burling has in store for its associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-salary-hike-not-all-offices-are-created-equal/) outside of New York City (i.e., nary a salary bump), you might have thought that law firms would start getting stingy with salary raises outside of New York. Thanks to the latest news we’ve received, we’re happy to let you know you were likely wrong.

A leading law firm that now finds itself on the [cutting edge for large law firm parental leave policies](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/biglaw-firm-makes-big-waves-with-gender-neutral-parental-leave-policy/) is now matching the Cravath base salary raise across all offices in America. Winston & Strawn, a Chicago-based firm with other offices in Charlotte, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Newark (NJ), San Francisco, Silicon Valley (Menlo Park, CA), and Washigton, D.C., will be improving associates’ wealth across the country.

Managing partner [Tom Fitzgerald](http://www.winston.com/en/who-we-are/attorneys/fitzgerald-thomas-p.html) and co-chairs [Jeffrey Kessler](http://www.winston.com/en/who-we-are/attorneys/kessler-jeffrey-l.html) and [Dan Webb](http://www.winston.com/en/who-we-are/attorneys/webb-dan-k.html) said the following in an email to associates announcing the good news this afternoon:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This increase in salaries recognizes the talent and hard work of our associates and their commitment to legal excellence and client service. Together with the firm’s parental leave benefits, this salary increase reflects our commitment to recruiting and maintaining a talented, diverse, and energetic team of associates and the next generation of leaders.

A thrilled associate had this to say of the firm’s generous pay raises: “In what I would consider a surprising (but exciting and very appreciated) move, Winston has matched Cravath for all U.S. offices! We are beyond excited but a bit surprised, because we don’t often consider Winston to be one of the trendsetters in such matters. This is a very welcome switch from the usually conservative approach to change.”

Congratulations to everyone at Winston & Strawn! Your firm is doing big things, and you should be proud to be a part of history in the making.

# Which Firms Offer Women The Most Power And Highest Pay? (2021)
## This list has shrunken in size since last year. What happened here?

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to put women attorneys on equal footing with their male counterparts, whether it be through hiring and retaining more women attorneys, promoting more women attorneys to equity partnership ranks, providing more leadership positions to women attorneys, or adopting more family-friendly policies to ensure that women attorneys are able to excel at their jobs while maintaining a stable work/life balance. Despite these continued assurances, and despite the fact that a number of firms have made great efforts to improve women’s stature in the law, there are only a few that offer women the chance to rise through the ranks to become major power players and to receive startlingly booming compensation.

Thanks to the Women in Law Empowerment Forum (WILEF), we have a way to find out which firms are on top when it comes to offering women attorneys the chance to perform on par with their male colleagues in terms of prestige and pay.

WILEF offers Biglaw firms with 300 or more lawyers practicing in the United States the chance to become Gold Standard certified, meaning that they must comply with four of six benchmarks that drive women lawyers to succeed in business development and leadership roles. Here are the criteria (two are mandatory):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- 25% of equity partners or, alternatively, 40% of the attorneys becoming equity partners during the past 12 months are women (mandatory)
- 10% of women equity partners are women of color or 4% of women equity partners are LGBT (mandatory)
- 20% of the firm and U.S. branch office heads are women
- 25% of the firm’s primary governance committee are women
- 25% of the firm’s compensation committee or its equivalent are women
- 20% of the top half of the firm’s equity partners in terms of compensation are women
This year, 29 firms made the cut, which is much lower than last year’s showing. What made the difference this year? WILEF increased the percentages necessary for firms to attain the first mandatory criteria (last year, 20% of equity partners or 33% of the attorneys becoming equity partners during the past 12 months had to be women; this is a difference of 5% and 7%, respecitvely). “At this time last year, we had 48 firms. It is obvious that upping the criteria made the difference. That said, upping the criteria was necessary as we move the needle forward,” said Elizabeth “Betiayn” Tursi, WILEF’s Global Chair. Biglaw firms continue to tout their commitment to women’s initiatives, yet this time, not even a third of the Am Law 100 appears on this list. Still more must be done when it comes to Biglaw firms raising the bar for their female attorneys.

Here are the 2021 recipients of Gold Standard certification (Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and Vinson & Elkins are both new to the list this year):

Although WILEF doesn’t tell us how the firms stack up against one another in terms of the criteria needed for certification, we do know that nine firms met all six benchmarks. Those firms are: Ballard Spahr; Freshfields; Hogan Lovells; Holland & Hart; Kutak Rock; Littler; Morgan Lewis & Bockius; Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart; and Sidley Austin.

It’s also worth noting that six of these firms have received Gold Standard certification every year since 2011, when WILEF first created this award. Those firms are: Ballard Spahr; Holland & Hart; Littler; Morrison & Foerster; Shook, Hardy & Bacon; and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.

Here are some interesting facts about how this year’s certified firms did overall:

- 2% of the firms met the criterion of 25% women among U.S. equity partners; 45.3% of the firms met the criteria of 40%
- The average was 31% of women as US branch heads
- Women constituted 38% of the members of the firms’ governance committees
- Women constituted 35% of their compensation committees
- 20.6% of women were in the top half of equity partners, in terms of compensation
- 6.5% of certified firms met or exceeded the 10% threshold for women of color and 3.8% met or exceeded the 4% threshold for LGBT women
Congratulations to all of the firms that were Gold Standard certified this year. You have our thanks for rising to the top of the Biglaw pack when it comes to women’s empowerment. We still have a way to go but these firms are making strides in the right direction. Thank you for helping women shine in legal practice.

# Lawyers Of Color Gears Up For Tenth Anniversary Promoting Diversity In The Legal Industry
## There's a lot planned for next year's campaign!

It’s hard to wrap my head around the fact that we’re about to hit the 10-year anniversary for [Lawyers of Color](https://lawyersofcolor.org/). The organization founded in 2013 to advance diversity in the legal industry has been a critical component of my coverage of legal industry diversity since I joined Above the Law.

As it happens, Above the Law had a role — not necessarily a positive one — in inspiring the non-profit. When Lawyers of Color president Yolanda Young got “laid off” after reporting an attorney using racial slurs, she [sued Covington & Burling](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/03/covington-and-its-staff-attorney-ghetto/). Her experience in the old Above the Law comment boards, where a small clique of sometimes virulent trolls lurked, helped bring Young realize “there needed to be a Black ATL!” Not just as a blog (though the now-dormant [On Being A Black Lawyer](http://onbeingablacklawyer.com/) certainly was that), but as a community.

Lawyers of Color replaced the daily blogging with putting out touchstone digital publications recognizing BIPOC legal professionals (unlike some accolades that we won’t mention by name, Lawyers of Color never requires a fee or sponsorship to be nominated or included in its publications either). Its [Black Student’s Guide To Law Schools & Firms](https://lawyersofcolor.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Black-Guide-2022-Low-Res.pdf) is a [tremendous resource](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/the-black-students-guide-to-law-schools-firms-is-up-to-date-and-right-on-time/) for students endeavoring to make this profession more representative and the [Law Firm Leaders](https://lawyersofcolor.org/law-firm-leaders-2022-2/) issue is “the first ever comprehensive listing of law firm decision makers who are of African, Asian, Hispanic, or Native American descent.” The upcoming calendar for 2023 promises another edition of those guides, as well as a comprehensive directory of BIPOC federal and state judges and law clerks, the hot list of junior and mid-level attorneys, and an issue honoring Capitol Hill staffers, lobbyists, and influencers.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
But Lawyers of Color could always use help. If your firm has lawyers who should be included in their guides, let them know! There’s no virtue in being shy when it comes to promoting visibility. Check out the [editorial calendar for 2023](https://lawyersofcolor.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Lawyers-of-Color-Editorial-Calendar.pdf), make note of the nominations deadlines, and reach out.

Congrats to Lawyers of Color on the upcoming anniversary!

# Gender Discrimination Lawsuit Against Jones Day Dropped -- Well, One Of Them At Least

Jones Day (Photo by David Lat)

Back in June of 2018, former Jones Day partner Wendy Moore [filed a gender discrimination lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/jones-day-hit-with-explosive-gender-discrimination-case/) against the firm. The complaint alleged “[f]emale attorneys are treated as second-class citizens. They are not, nor can they be, full members in the fraternity.” There were further allegations that the firm’s [infamous](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/?rf=1) black box compensation model “all but ensures that female attorneys are paid less than their male counterparts.”

But that juicy lawsuit is now over. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/06/17/former-jones-day-partner-drops-gender-discrimination-suit-against-firm/) Law.com, Moore gets back her capital contribution to the firm and in exchange, she has dropped the case:

A spokesman for Jones Day said Monday that Moore “has now dismissed all of her claims against Jones Day in exchange for return of the capital that she previously contributed to the Firm.”

Moore is now [a partner at Perkins Coie](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/wendy-l-moore.html).

Despite the resolution of this matter, Jones Day still faces [another lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/jones-day-facing-second-class-action-lawsuit-over-fraternity-culture-of-the-firm/) making similar allegations of a fraternity culture and unequal pay. This second lawsuit was filed by former associates, rather than a partner, for a total of [seven plaintiffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/gender-discrimination-lawsuit-against-jones-day-gets-yet-another-plaintiff/) — three named and four as Jane Doe plaintiffs, [at least for now](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/jones-day-wants-gender-discrimination-plaintiffs-to-reveal-themselves-to-the-public/) — and is a purported class action. And you can bet we’ll be following all of the twists and turns of that case as they develop.

# HR Departments Are Now Doing Any% Diversity Speed Runs

Has attending a diversity and inclusion lecture ever made you wish you could [press F to check your privilege](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtMzTGfs-fc)? Well, today is your lucky day. Companies are, quite literally, trying to game the system by using points, badges, discounts, and status indicators to encourage diversity, equality, and inclusion. Because you know, common decency isn’t enough on its own.

An examination of gamification as a whole, however, shows how it lends itself to addressing serious issues, and even encourages people to tackle topics they may have been reluctant to discuss. Rather than trivializing the seriousness of DEI, gamification drives the point home and changes how people view their own biases and the experiences of others.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As lofty as this may sound, I can think of at least one instance where game developers used a feature that could foster frank discussion of race. Like when South Park made being black activate [hard mode](https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/9/16435592/south-park-race-difficulty) for the game The Fractured But Whole. At least in theory (it didn’t actually change the difficulty). Maybe playing as a black character would have been what it took to get Gary from antitrust to stop asking his sun-kissed co-workers if they actually worked there during smoke breaks.

As diversity incentives gamify, one can only imagine the [dire consequences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGQx37dwnhM) that will be faced when some bright-eyed first-year associate slips out her first slur. Will the crisis that arises from discovering that half of the race-players are Team Xbox and other half are Team PC be a budgeting problem or an HR one? Will being forced to play games centered on race and inclusion lead to cries of “reverse discrimination” and be the next fatal step toward “be work or be unemployed” culture? ‘Cause I hope so. I never want to work with bigots again.

In all honesty, I pray to [Daigo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSGW7CwD5GM) that this goofy idea becomes a goofy reality. When some C-suite executive in a grey suit inevitably stands up to talk about how poggers having more minorities in the office is, please send the audio to tips@abovethelaw.com.

# Having Promised To Not Follow The Market, This Firm Is Trying To Quietly Pay A Lucky Few
## If you haven't gotten a raise, the firm might simply not value you.

Two months ago, when Biglaw raises were just a ray of Milbank’s magnanimity, Greenberg Traurig chairman Richard Rosenbaum [boldly proclaimed that the firm would not be following along](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/greenberg-traurig-explains-why-its-too-cheap-to-raise-associate-salaries/?rf=1). He declared the firm “wind proof” from the market forces of associate compensation.

Now that the market has fully moved and Greenberg Traurig associates can rightly claim to be among the most underpaid associates in Biglaw, the firm is in a tough spot. Do they admit that market forces… exist? Or do they stubbornly continue to make associates pay for the firm’s “culture.” Or is there a third way?

Tipsters report that Greenberg Traurig is quietly making raises for some associate class years in some markets and practice groups, but the raises are not across the board and are not to be publicized.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Without giving anybody away, it appears that valuable practice groups in major markets received a raise to market compensation. Some, but certainly not all, associates in these treasured practice groups also received the summer bonus. The news was communicated on a individual basis, and Greenberg isn’t telling its associates what the plan actually is or what you had to do, or have to do going forward, to receive market compensation.

Greenberg Traurig did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

This isn’t a bad strategy, especially if you think of your employees as a greedy labor force with no collective bargaining power, as opposed to trusted colleagues. Raising some associates, but not others, creates division. It engenders feelings of pride among the favored practice groups, while sowing doubt in the minds of those who didn’t get a raise that maybe they just aren’t good enough lawyers to merit one.

And, not for nothing, paying people differently based on where they work and what they work on is what most firms would do if the market wasn’t so collusive. If you were running a law and shirtwaists factory, you’d obviously pay the highly skilled labor in the major market more than the unskilled labor in a secondary market, and make intelligent distinctions for every classification of worker in between.

So the real difference between what Greenberg is doing and what a better run company would do is… transparency. People should be able to know that if that they’ll be paid below market in a secondary market, but at market in a major one. They should know which practice groups GT values most highly, if those practice groups can expect to be paid more than others. Lawyers are smart, they can make and accept their own decisions if you just give them enough information to make those decisions.

At the very least, the firm shouldn’t sacrifice transparency and honesty with its associates just so the chairman can save face in the press.

Announcing that the firm was immune to the market was probably a mistake. GT needs to admit that, take its medicine, and tell all of their associates what their compensation plan really is.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff.

Biglaw firms continue to be impacted by the market upheaval caused by the coronavirus crisis, and the way most law firms thus far have decided to steady their finances is through salary cuts. Today, we have news on a firm that’s chosen to “spread the burden as equitably as possible” with firmwide reductions.

Loeb & Loeb, a firm that’s well known for its entertainment practice group, will be slashing salaries across the board in an effort to “minimize layoffs and furloughs.” How deep are the firm’s temporary pay cuts? Here’s an excerpt from the memo that just went out (available on the next page):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


One source doesn’t feel like these cuts are very equitable, since Loeb & Loeb “didn’t even pay close to market to begin with.” Not for nothing, but now might not be the best time to complain about market salaries considering the fact that the firm is doing this to try to keep associates in their jobs. Hopefully the firm remains true to its word.

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Loeb & Loeb.)

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

‘We did it!’

You’ve beaten the odds, and obtained one of the relatively few, highly desirable offers to work at a Biglaw firm as a summer associate.  Congratulations!  Now, it’s important to understand [why the program exists](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/summer-associate-programs-part-i-why-they-exist-and-firms-different-approaches/), what you should [expect from the program](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/summer-associate-programs-part-ii-expectations-of-the-summer-associates-and-attorneys/), and what attorneys at Biglaw firms expect from you as a summer associate and how to succeed.

During my many years working in Am Law 100 law firms, as a partner, leader, and practice leader, including working on law school recruiting teams and with my firm’s recruiting committee, I was responsible for hiring, evaluating, and training numerous summer associates.  I’ve seen scores of summer associates come and go, and worked with summer associates from pretty much every law school that usually sends law students into Biglaw firms.  The summer associates have ranged from the unbelievable (in a bad way) to the exceptional.  Time and again, the exceptional and successful summer associates seem to do the same things.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

What are those things?  And how can you maximize the likelihood of success in your summer associate program (i.e., receiving a full-time job offer at the firm after law school graduation)?  Below are a few of those things and tips for success, some of which are excerpted from the book Big Law Confidential.

- Do Research in Advance. Sometimes a summer associate’s experience working with a practice group will materially and substantively differ from their experience working with that practice group as an associate, causing them great dissatisfaction as an associate. In other words, some practice groups are great at making a convincing sales pitch during the summer program, but once you “buy,” you find out you were duped. Law students should research the prospective firm and potential practice groups of interest before, or toward the beginning of, their summer program, and to focus their time and efforts on working with the “best” practice groups they think they’d most like to work in as an associate.  This research may (and ideally will) include speaking with 3Ls who were summer associates at the firm and junior associates in the firm/practice group(s) of interest.
- Remember that Quality Is WAY More Important Than Quantity. As one of my mentors was fond of saying, “right is better than fast — it’s most important to get the right answer and do good work, since no one cares how fast you can turn out wrong answers or crappy work.” This is something summer associates should always bear in mind.  Biglaw firms expect a lot of summer associates (and even more, of associates), including doing a high quantity of work, timely and efficiently.  But the most important thing is that any work that you do is of a very high quality.
- Get Work Done, but also Get Out from Behind the Desk. One of the main objectives of a summer associate program is to match each summer associate with the best-fitting practice group — ideally, a match that suits both sides. It’s often the social events and moments that happen away from the desk that allow the summer associate and attorneys to get to know each other and best determine practice group fit. Summer associates should plan to come to the office early and/or stay late as needed to complete their work, to have time to attend social events, informational lunches about practice groups, casual coffee chats, etc. Remember: people like to work with people they like, and people who are like them. Get your work done and then get out from behind the desk, to get to know your potential future colleagues and determine if you like them, and give them a chance to get to know and like you.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
- Always Be Prepared and Punctual. Never go anywhere within the firm without a paper notebook, two pens (in case one runs out of ink), and your work cell phone. Summer associates can receive assignments in hallways, elevators, while having coffee, etc.  If you’re invited to listen in on a call or participate in a meeting, be dialed in or present at least two to five minutes before the scheduled start time (and factor in time for potential elevator delays, getting lost, etc.) and be sure to show up prepared with any materials (e.g., copies of relevant documents), and to take notes.  I once worked with a summer associate who was never prepared and never took notes.  It made a poor impression with me and the other attorneys in our practice group, and resulted in them not getting a full-time job offer with our practice group.
- Dress for Success. There’s a saying: dress for the role you want. Summer associates want to receive an offer to join a Biglaw firm as an associate, so they should dress at least as professionally as most associates, as appropriate for each situation. Look to other attorneys at your firm for guidance, since each firm has its own culture and dress standards, on the spectrum from business casual to business formal, and follow the lead of the majority who seem to be well respected and dressed appropriately. If you’re in doubt about whether to wear something, don’t wear it and wear something else that is more conservative/classic.
- Act Professionally. Successful summer associates act like they’re already professionals (associates), whether inside or outside the firm, including with respect to social media usage, how they respond in emails, how they interact with colleagues and clients, and otherwise.  I once worked with a summer associate who responded to emails from partners with one-word “yep” responses, or emojis.  They received counseling on professionalism and did not receive a full-time job offer with our practice group.  The little things make an impression, and matter, when it comes to firms deciding whether to make full-time job offers.  Ensure that you’re remembered for positive things such as the quality of your work, the professional way you comport yourself, etc., and not as the “yep” guy.
- Display a Positive Attitude. Attorneys like working with other attorneys, summer associates, and staff who have positive attitudes. Displaying humility, a genuine desire to learn and understand, an eagerness to rise to the challenge, and a longing to help the team, can translate into greater credibility, influence, and in my experience, a greater likelihood of receiving a full-time job offer at the firm.
Best wishes to you for success with your summer associate program, and beyond!

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Is Taking Heat For Moving To DPW Salary Scale... In Brussels
## No one outside the firm is too thrilled about this money move.

I don’t understand the reasoning behind the salary hike. I don’t think anyone was asking for it. If people are really working day and night, you can always solve that by giving a very impressive bonus. Brussels is not the U.S. It has never been and never will be.

— the Brussels managing partner of a U.S. Biglaw firm, commenting anonymously on Wilson Sonini’s decision to [put associates and of counsel in its Brussels office on the Davis Polk salary scale](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/11/04/no-one-was-asking-for-this-brussels-lawyers-react-to-wilson-sonsinis-crazy-pay-hike-405-94054/) earlier this week. Other managing partners and senior attorneys at Brussels firms have described the salary increase as “absolutely crazy,” “unbelievable,” and “off the charts,” with one even noting that it “makes no business sense.” The anonymous Biglaw managing partner says he has no intention to match the new salaries, but expects that other firms may boost compensation — perhaps even to the heights reached by WSGR — as a “knee-jerk reaction” to the move.

These types of questions can slow you down, but they don’t have to. [Watch this webinar](http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5248165841&iu=/1006611/abovethelaw/newslettertracker) to get a firsthand look at the most advanced AI-based project Thomson Reuters has ever tackled: [Westlaw Edge Quick Check](http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5248165841&iu=/1006611/abovethelaw/newslettertracker). Quick Check goes beyond traditional research methods to uncover relevant authority that may have been missed.

Legal research will never be the same.

# Biglaw Holiday Party Turns Into COVID Outbreak
## The party isn't the problem... the culture is the problem.

Navigating this winter may present the biggest challenge firms have faced since the start of the pandemic. Early on, firms needed to pull the plug on in-person office work and develop a system to keep revenue churning during a lockdown. But now, firms have to make the call on when to return to the office, balancing the reality of fully vaccinated attorneys and staff with another COVID surge and a brand new, arguably more virulent variant.

Some firms have gone back in, others have pushed it off into the new year. But regardless of office policy, firms must also grapple with the holiday party conundrum. In a bid to build a winning culture, could firms finally bring everyone under one roof to meet and mingle? Or would it be another sad Zoom party?

There’s not a great answer either way. [We even asked folks in a survey to let us know their thoughts about parties](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/whats-going-on-with-this-years-holiday-parties/).

Unfortunately, a holiday get together for Latham’s New York Corporate Department has ended in a bit of an outbreak. The name of the HR department contact is redacted.



That’s not great. Tipsters say upwards of 10 associates have tested positive since the party (which is a lot for a population that’s 100 percent vaccinated by rule… ominously Omicron-ic). And yet, it’s hard to blame the firm for wanting a little bit of normal.

The firm wasn’t trying to “square peg round hole” its way back to normal like Tammy in Bumblyville refusing to wear a mask at the Trader Joe’s. [Latham got on board with a vaccine mandate](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/latham-vaccination/) for the express purpose of getting the firm back to normal safely, issuing the requirement even though almost everyone in the firm had voluntarily done the right thing. And if you have to take the drawbacks of trudging to the office occasionally, you should enjoy the advantage of being able to grab a drink with a colleague.

But, as many of us are learning, the vaccine doesn’t completely end the risk of contracting the virus. My vaccine held up after standing next to another breakthrough infection without a mask for hours in Las Vegas, but ultimately fell as I went about my daily life. The vaccine deserves all the credit for turning my bout into little more than a minor 24-hour cough, though.

So how does a firm negotiate the continued risk of contracting the virus with the benefits of vaccination in guarding against severe cases? Public health officials suggest that the virus may be with us forever at this point, and we may have to start approaching it as something “comparable to the flu” like many people falsely believed it was from the start.



While it sucks for Latham to be the first of what will inevitably be many firms to get stung by this outcome, the firm demonstrates the proper response here. Stay home and get tested if you think you’ve been exposed — even if you’re vaccinated.

Because the problem here isn’t the existence of a holiday party in a vaccinated world, it’s how the party is presented to employees. One tipster said junior associates were “strongly pressured” to attend. If that’s the case — and this sort of pressure can arise in law firms without superiors even realizing it — this is troubling and something that proper precautions and a cautious response can’t overcome.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Culturally, firms need to be prepared to excuse anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable taking the risks associated with a gathering right now. Because even if vaccines help the individual, they may have people in their lives that can’t get immunized yet and firms need to respect that. Partners need to actively police the passive-aggressive pressures that abound in law firms to make sure no one feels compelled to go to an in-person event right now. And this is a long-term issue for firms where partners don’t always grasp that parties can feel like “mandatory fun.” No one should feel like protecting their newborn or immunocompromised spouse is keeping them from networking and advancing their career.

Hopefully, everyone involved in this outbreak will recover swiftly and without further consequence. But it’s a reminder to firms to carefully weigh the demands they’re putting on associates right now because… this thing is still out there.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Litigation Powerhouse Announces Special Bonus Pool
## Bonuses on top of bonuses?! Associates must be thrilled!

The litigation powerhouse of Quinn Emanuel, one of the most formidable and financially successful firms in all of Biglaw, just announced a special bonus plan to attract and retain associates. According to our sources, there’s good news about the firm’s bonus bucks, but unfortunately, there’s also some bad news.

We’ll start off with the good news. Quinn Emanuel’s special bonuses come in addition to regular bonuses for second- through sixth-year associates, and will be tied to the performance of the firm. If Quinn Emanuel does well, associates will do well. This year, for example, the firm will be directing 1 percent of its profits to the special associate bonus pool.

What about the bad news? There’s a reason why the firm is calling this an “associate longevity bonus pool.” These special bonuses, which could very well be huge, take some time to vest. If associates want their money, they’re going to have to stick around for a while. How long? Three years. Here’s an example of how this works, taken from an email sent to associates from John Quinn:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A qualifying second year associate for 2017 will get a provisional award in March 2018. That award will be paid in March 2021 as long as the associate is still with the Firm at that time. The same associate will be eligible to receive an award in March 2019. That award would be paid in 2022. The same associate would also be eligible for an award in March 2020 which would be payable in March 2023, and so on until the associate’s 7th year at which point the associate is no longer eligible for new awards but can keep collecting old awards as long as the associate does not resign before an award is due to be paid.

If an associate leaves the firm at any time prior to the date the vesting period ends, that associate will lose out on any cash he could have earned from this special bonus pool. Basically, the only way that an associate will be able to collect this cash early is through death or disability (or involuntary termination without cause). Here’s some relevant language on that point from a memorandum that was attached to Quinn’s email (available in full on the next page):

Awards are considered provisional and unearned until completion of service for the entire vesting period and are earned only by continued service to the Firm for the entire vesting period. Unearned awards automatically terminate with no right to payment upon termination of employment.

But wait, there’s more. Not only are counsel and staff attorneys ineligible for the special bonus pool, but associates must have billed more than 2000 client hours (not including pro bono hours) to maintain their eligibility.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to an associate at he firm, the general feeling is that this news is “significant,” but no one has any idea how much they stand to earn. In the words of a source: “Certainly there are no complaints, but none of us have even the faintest notion of how much this will equate to come the first round of future bonuses in March.” As far as why the firm has chosen to make associates wait three years to cash in on these special bonuses, here’s what another tipster had to say: “They’ll do anything to tie people down at this point, even if the vesting period is a cruel length of time.” Is Quinn Emanuel having a problem with associate retention? If so, offering them what could be vast sums of money to make them stick around at the firm doesn’t seem like a bad idea.

In any event, congratulations to all second- through sixth-year associates at Quinn Emanuel! Bonuses on top of bonuses is nothing to complain about, no matter how long it takes for the money to land in your bank account. (Our opinion on this could change, of course, once March comes around and we find out the size of the future rewards associates will reap.)

And now, a brief word on Biglaw bonuses, generally. We’re happy to cover those announcements, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks!

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Is Law Practice Management Software Still A Sound Investment?

The U.S. economy has sure been a wild ride over the last four years. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, law firms were snapping up cloud-based law practice management software in record numbers.

But, as inflation settles in, is that still a good investment?

To figure it all out, we invited Joshua Hostilo of [Filevine](https://filevine.com/), Blake Roberts of [Lawmatics](https://lawmatics.com/), Marie Burgess of [Paradigm](https://joinparadigm.com/), and Igor Selizhuk of [SmartAdvocate](https://smartadvocate.com/) onto the Non-Eventcast podcast. 

The group addresses how law practice management software is effective for law firms in almost any economic environment, and how it can be used to help “recession-proof” your law firm (6:40). 

The team also attempts to pin down the future of case management software (14:42).  Everybody then weighs in on the spate of acquisitions in the legaltech space (24:29), before selecting their favorite reports (30:18) in, and software integrations (32:19) for case management software.

Law practice management software has been around for a long time, and for a good time – because it keeps getting better! Listen, to learn more.

Last year, [Winston & Strawn](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/winston-strawn-llp/) paid [New York City bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/associate-bonus-watch-omelveny-myers-winston-strawn-and-more-about-morrison-foerster/) (i.e., [Davis Polk bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/associate-bonus-watch-davis-polk-beats-simpson/)) to qualifying associates in NYC. This year, the firm is paying the New York scale (i.e, [Cravath bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/)) to qualifying associates in all of its U.S. offices.

We didn’t get a copy of the memo — if you happen to have it, please [send our way](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Winston%20and%20Strawn) — so we reached out to Winston for confirmation. The firm responded as follows:

Yes, this information is correct. In addition to the New York market (i.e., Cravath) scale in U.S. offices, the firm also paid additional bonuses (on top of the regular bonuses) to associates who met defined hours thresholds above 2,000 hours. The highest of those additional bonuses was $30,000.

Very nice. Congrats to Winston associates on these rewards for their hard work.

If you have bonus news that we have not yet covered — even if it’s a little old (Winston bonuses came out in early February) — please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus%20News) or text us (646-820-8477). As you know, we are trying to build as comprehensive a repository as possible of bonus information and memos. Thanks.

# Dissolving A Biglaw Firm Is Messy Business
## It isn't easy when your law firm collapses.

After finally confirming what many observers had long suspected — that the one-time Am Law 200 firm of LeClairRyan [was going out of business](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/biglaw-firm-finally-admits-its-closing/) — LeClairRyan has now officially embarked upon the process of winding down, and it’s turning into a real situation. The firm informed employees that their last day of employment will be August 30th, and many still left at the firm find themselves scrambling to get their affairs in order.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/08/14/rivals-scoop-up-leclairryan-lawyers-as-clock-ticks-on-dissolution-insurance-coverage/) Law.com, one area of concern for many is health insurance. Because LeClairRyan has a self-insured plan, when the firm is gone as of September 1, so is employees’ health insurance, and the firm is saying they don’t need to provide Cobra benefits:

The firm has told attorneys that it doesn’t have to provide Cobra benefits to extend their health insurance coverage because it uses a “self-insured” benefit plan and the firm itself is shutting down, according to a lawyer transitioning out of the firm.

“A lot of people are not very happy about it,” the lawyer said. “A lot of people have kids, so we’re going to have to find a catastrophe policy in case one of our kids develops cancer on September 1.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Many lawyers are also working to wrap up outstanding expenses, move their retirement fund, and send out collections, with accounts receivable reportedly being moved to the firm’s lenders:

LeClairRyan’s bank has taken control of the firm’s accounts receivable account, two sources said. LeClairRyan, in announcing its impending dissolution Aug. 7, stated it was “working in cooperation with its lender to ensure the continuity of client service” until its practice ceased.

Plus, they have to figure out what’s the next step in their legal careers. While part of what precipitated the firm’s demise was a drastic reduction in headcount as partners and senior lawyers departed the firm for greener pastures, not everyone was so lucky as to have their landing place locked down before LeClairRyan announced it was closing its doors. Clark Hill appears to be scooping up quite a few of soon-to-be former LeClairRyan attorneys — after previously hiring a labor and employment group from Los Angeles, they’re now reportedly poised to take on LeClairRyan lawyers in New York, New Haven, Connecticut, and Houston. Lewis Brisbois also looks like a winner in the process, announcing they are hiring 11 attorney, five of whom are partners, from the products liability group.

Best of luck to the LeClairRyan faithful, as they now try to move on from the failed firm.

# Paul Weiss's Bold Leadership On Coronavirus Pro Bono Efforts
## Damn. 2,500 pro bono hours a day. And it's still not enough.

Brad Karp

Terror is a feeling we’re all getting used to keeping at bay. The novel virus COVID-19 seems to be coming for us all, indiscriminately [afflicting friends](https://twitter.com/DavidLat/status/1239765732088479744?s=20) and [celebrities](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/idris-elba-tests-positive-coronavirus-1284878) with equal ease. And even for those privileged enough to assume they can survive the health impacts, the [economic downturn](https://dealbreaker.com/2020/03/icahn-coronavirus) is looming, the first harbinger of which are the slew of restaurant workers that have just been laid off. It’s enough to make anyone want to bury their head in the sand until the whole mess blows over.

That (albeit, understandable) approach is pretty much the opposite of what Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp did as the impacts of COVID-19 started to cascade. He’s decided to harness the awesome power of Biglaw to help those who are facing daunting economic realities. As officials on the federal, state and local levels are working to ameliorate those impacts, Karp is organizing pro bono efforts at Paul Weiss to help folks navigate those complicated waters. As he [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/03/16/paul-weiss-mobilizes-army-of-lawyers-to-help-navigate-coronavirus-relief/):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“As these programs are rolling out, I believe we’re going to be able to help these individuals access emergency resources that would otherwise be unavailable,” he said.

On Saturday afternoon, he sent a firmwide email looking for volunteers to build a “swat team” to make sense of these resources. Within two hours, over 350 attorneys at the firm had responded by pledging their assistance. Another 25 to 50 have volunteered since the start of the day Monday.

“I’ve been chair of this firm for 13 years,” Karp said. “There’s nothing I’ve seen that compares to this.”

Those lawyers are already at work. They’re researching federal programs, New York state programs, New York City programs, other state programs, and private and charitable organization programs. They’re drafting FAQs, templates and other forms. And they’ll be staffing a 24/7 hotline to answer questions about all the programs.

Karp anticipates the firm will spend 2,500 hours a day on the effort, but he doesn’t think that’ll be enough. He’s calling on other firms to join in the effort so that the full power of Biglaw can be thrown at the problem:

“I think in the U.S. we’re going to need thousands of lawyers to step up and work with us on this,” he said.
