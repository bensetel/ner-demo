Fresh off adopting a [“one-size-fits-all” office policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/top-biglaw-firm-adopts-one-size-fits-all-office-policy-where-partners-no-longer-rule-the-real-estate-roost/) for partners and associates alike, Freshfields has made another announcement to welcome New York attorneys to its new space at 3 World Trade Center: with the new turf will come a new hybrid work policy.

Come May 1, fee earners at Freshfields, including partners, associates, and legal assistants, among others, will be expected to spend four days working at the office each week. As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/27/freshfields-the-latest-to-move-to-4-days-in-us-offices/), the firm has not yet announced the specifics for what in-office schedules will look like for other staff and business services team members.

Freshfields — which took home $2,276,264,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 17 on the 2023 Global 100 — now joins the following firms that have announced four-day in-office work policies: Davis Polk; Ropes & Gray; Simpson Thacher; Skadden Arps; Vinson & Elkins; and Weil Gotshal.

# Layoffs Won't Stop This Am Law Top 20 Firm From Offering Bountiful Bonuses
## It's time for some happy news at this firm!

What a whirlwind of a month it’s been for Goodwin Procter. The top 20 Am Law firm kicked off the new year by announcing a [reduction in force](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/), letting go 90 or more attorneys (about 5% of its workforce). A short time later, the firm welcomed a number of health sciences partners and associates to its fold through a [group lateral move](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/sure-goodwin-just-laid-off-a-bunch-of-lawyers-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-going-to-stop-adding-laterals/) from Troutman Pepper. And now, Goodwin is closing out January by announcing bonuses for associates.

Even though the firm is fresh off a series of layoffs, it’s back to business as usual, because Goodwin is offering a market match when it comes to its 2022 year-end bonuses. Here’s the grid for bonuses at the firm (and if you’re interested, you can find the memo on the following page):

Salary Class	Bonus
2021	$20,000
2020	$30,000
2019	$57,500
2018	$75,000
2017	$90,000
2016	$105,000
2015+	$115,000
To be eligible to receive a bonus at Goodwin, associates must have billed 1,950 hours during the firm’s fiscal year, which concluded at the end of September. Those who billed hours that were “materially higher” than the eligibility threshold — as well as associates in their fourth year or above who received a distinctive rating — will receive additional bonus money from the firm. (And on a positive note, we’re hearing from sources who recently lost their jobs at the firm, and they received their bonuses today as well.)

Congratulations to everyone at Goodwin on their bonuses!

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Goodwin Procter.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Former Biglaw Chairman Dies In Fiery Blaze
## According to a colleague, he 'thought about the law as a noble calling, and not just as a business or a profession.'

This past weekend brought some incredibly unfortunate news to the Biglaw community after the former leader of one of the most prominent firms in the nation was identified as a victim in a deadly blaze at his Manhattan apartment.

[John Merow](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/JohnE-Merow/), 89, who led Sullivan & Cromwell in the 80s and 90s, was found alongside his wife, Mary, 85, after a fire broke out in their apartment at about 5 a.m. on January 12. According to police, Mary was pronounced dead at the scene with severe burns, while John later died at a hospital.

Merow, a graduate of Havard Law School, worked for Sullivan & Cromwell for 60 years. He first joined the firm in 1958, became a partner in 1964, became the firm’s vice chairman in 1986, and continued his leadership ascent to become the firm’s chairman and senior partner in 1987. Merow served as chair until 1994, but retained the senior partner title for more than two decades before his death.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Merow had a bigger impact on the firm than just his oversight of international expansion (Sullivan & Cromwell opened offices in Australia and Japan under his watch. From the [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/01/14/former-sullivan-cromwell-chair-and-wife-killed-in-apartment-fire/):

“John is probably the last of a generation of extraordinarily skillful lawyers and individuals who thought about the law as a noble calling, and not just as a business or a profession,” said former Sullivan & Cromwell chairman and now senior chairman H. Rodgin Cohen. …

“He had a clear grasp of the growing internationalization of the legal practice and I think was more responsible than any individual at the firm in catching that wave and understanding the ramifications,” Cohen said.

Cohen was reminded of a story about Merow’s admirable belief in judging people on their merits, as opposed to on their backgrounds. For example, in 1993, a professor from Merow’s alma mater alleged that firms like Sullivan & Cromwell “were closed to Jews,” so Merow wrote to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/business/l-a-law-firm-open-to-all-673893.html) with his comment: “This firm has never been ‘closed to Jews’ or, for that matter, to any religious or ethnic group. Quite to the contrary. Hiring and advancement always have been based on merit, nothing else.”

# For This Biglaw Firm First Comes Raises, Then Comes The Fine Print

It was just over a month ago when [Morgan Lewis & Bockius](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/morgan-lewis-bockius/), with its $2,001,000,000 in gross revenue for 2017, [announced associate base salary raises and special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/with-over-2-billion-in-revenue-of-course-this-firm-raised-associate-salaries/?rf=1) in line with the market standard. But now that the dust has settled and the euphoria of new money has died down, the firm has released certain conditions on the money everyone had been cheering.

According to tipsters at the firm, yesterday associates got practice group-specific voicemails letting them know that the extra money they thought they’d be getting for sure was actually contingent on a rating system in addition to any clear hours requirement. And sources there are already concerned about the lack of clarity:

Morgan Lewis just sent out a voicemail saying that not all associates will get the Milbank raise or bonus. The decisions will be based on nebulous criteria, apparently something additional to an objective billable hours requirement. It seems they advertised a match in name only to be included in the good press last month.

Another associate at the firm has a little more information about how they decision will be made, but still concedes there’s a ton of vagueness in the process:

That’s correct. The voicemail was quite vague, however we have a ratings system that shows you as either below, meeting or exceeding expectations. If your mid year review had you as below, my understanding is you will not be getting a summer bonus (nor would you get a year end at below expectations ratings). The hours requirement is 1900 and you just have to be on track we believe (nothing has been 100% specific here or detailing what happens if you aren’t on track but later make up the hours by year end).

And given none of these conditions were known last month when the firm made its initial compensation announcement, well, you can’t be surprised at the motivations sources are ascribing to the move:

[The previous announcement] was certainly an attempt to preserve candidates until a later date, since there are many mid-level positions open at the firm and OCI is just around the corner. Morgan Lewis has had shady bonus policies for years now, and despite keeping up appearances of changing that, it looks like we are back where we started in black box decision making.

# Firm Hands Out Massive Bonuses -- 150 Percent Cravath Scale For Many
## Big billers took home big bonuses at this law firm.

When you hear that a firm hands out individualized bonuses that associates don’t get to enjoy until February, that’s usually a bad sign. These “black box” bonuses ostensibly promote free-market principles by rewarding attorneys for individual initiative in contrast to the collectivist lockstep model, but in reality they usually just give firms cover to shortchange lawyers without the prying eyes of publications like this one.

Meanwhile, February bonuses are always an unwelcome stick in the eye that disrupts the lateral market where many associates choose to time their leap with their end-of-year bonus.

But there’s no need to lateral if your firm is blowing away the market scale like Cooley LLP.

Cooley is a black box bonus firm, meaning we can’t speak for the entire universe of bonuses, but associates learned their individualized bonus amounts during their recent personal reviews, and many have opened up about what they got to help provide the legal community with a better sense of Cooley’s compensation.

The consensus is that big billers got big bonuses:

Just a data point from Cooley. No bonus memo to forward (firm doesn’t have one), but was a high biller (over 2400) and got the firm max this year of 50% over Cravath. Pretty pleased.

A 50 percent bump over the Cravath scale amounts to serious cash, especially for senior attorneys:

Cooley senior associate here. Wanted to report that the firm smashed the market for high performing seniors (several tens of thousands above Cravath). We had an increasingly strong year and I want to applaud the partnership transferring some of that to the associate bonus pool.

But is that really more valuable than the [$10 Starbucks card that Brewer gave out as a bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/associate-bonus-watch-10-starbucks-cards-for-top-billers/)? I mean, law school debt comes and goes, but can you really put a price on the memories you’ll have reminiscing about that Pumpkin Spice Latte in 10 years?

The risk with any tale of generous bonuses for top billers is a corresponding disaster for the rest of the lawyer corps. Thankfully, all indications suggest Cooley’s rewards for hardworking seniors didn’t trade off with bringing good cheer to the rest of the firm — rumor has it that the bonus pool ended up being larger than if they were to have given everyone market bonuses. In addition to individualized meetings, the firm held a large meeting to explain, if generally, how they calibrated bonuses across the firm and so far everyone who has reached out to us sounds pleased.

Remember, we need your help when it comes to bonus news — [especially at firms that hand out individualized bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/bonus-season-isnt-over-its-just-getting-harder-to-decipher-without-your-help/).

# Associate Bonus Watch: The First Cravath Match Is Here!
## Which firm was first to copy market leader Cravath?

Well, that was quick! Cravath Swaine & Moore announced bonuses at about 3:20 p.m. (EST), and now, less than 30 minutes later, at 3:45 p.m., a top Biglaw firm has matched the CSM scale. Wow!

As usual, Milbank Tweed is the first firm to match market leader Cravath. This marks the third year in a row that Milbank has been one of the first to hop on the Cravath bonus bandwagon. Here’s what one rather displeased associate had to say about the firm’s bonus announcement: “We were previously told that all metrics of profitability were up year over year, so a bit of a disappointment. Hoping for a raise by DPW.” People are getting tired of receiving the same bonus year after year, and all eyes are apparently on Davis Polk to beat the market and toss life vests made of money to associates, just like the firm did [back in 2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/associate-bonus-watch-davis-polk-beats-simpson/).

Flip to the next page to see Milbank’s bonus memo. The Milbank bonuses will be paid “on or before” December 29, 2017. This date is slightly later than the Cravath payout date of December 15, which might be annoying from a holiday shopping perspective, but it’s not a huge difference. Plus, it’s before 2018, which is a new tax year — one that could have some pretty drastic effects on associates’ take-home pay.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Judge Calls DOJ 'Sons Of Bitches' On The Record

Judge Lynn Hughes

When Judge Lynn Hughes issued an opinion blasting attorneys from the Department of Justice [as “pretentious” and “inept,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/brutal-benchslap-tags-doj-prosecutors-as-pretentious-and-inept/) we thought it represented the pent-up — but likely justified — frustration of a federal judge tired of outside attorneys swooping into his jurisdiction and creating brush fires and delays like a screwball Jerry Lewis version of a lawyer. Sure it was over-the-top, but in the annals of Judge Hughes outbursts, this was hardly outrageous.

But hoo boy, the transcript. The transcript is a work of unprofessional art.

Upon being informed that a lawyer from the counterterrorism section of the DOJ in D.C. had filed a notice of appearance on the account of the local AUSA:



This is how the hearing starts. This is the first page of the record!

After this, Judge Hughes starts badgering the DOJ lawyer, Kashyap Patel, about his informal appearance owing to Patel having just arrived from Central Asia where he was doing more counterterrorism work. This is insufficient for Judge Hughes, who starts questioning Patel’s passport for not having time stamps even though time stamps are for f**king tourists and everyone who’s traveled internationally uses Global Entry in America.

One of the best Archer jokes involves Archer continuing to believe that a blimp (rigid airship!) would explode like the Hindenburg despite repeatedly being told that helium isn’t flammable. When asked what he isn’t getting about these warnings, he replies, “Obviously the core concept.” I mention that here because lest you think Judge Hughes is just missing the particulars of the Global Entry program:



He doesn’t get the core concept of the program. How is this guy qualified to hear a terrorism case in 2016 if he doesn’t even know how people enter and exit the country?

Then Judge Hughes enjoys a complete break and starts venting about his taxes. Yes, that’s actually what happens: a federal judge starts complaining about a federal prosecutor because… taxes.

Judge Hughes may be right that regional offices are more capable of prosecuting cases in their jurisdiction than any interloper from Washington and that interference from Main Justice only slows things down. But the thing with labeling plots by radical extremists part of a GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR™ is having to accept that there’s going to be a centralized approach — one sensitive to the overlapping and interlocking cases of multiple suspects in multiple districts (indeed, worldwide) — and that means respecting that the Department of Justice needs to quarterback everything. If Judge Hughes thinks a hotel room in Houston is too rich for his blood, wait until they tell him how much that Iraq thing cost.

There’s so much more in this transcript. Patel leaves the courtroom and Judge Hughes continues to kvetch about people from Washington staying home when it snows and his own confirmation hearing being held up over an agricultural bill. It’s an epic rant that helps solidify Judge Hughes as one of the loosest cannons on the bench.

# SPACs 101: Everything You Need to Know
## The legal landscape surrounding SPACs is constantly shifting.

Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) are one of the hottest topics in corporate and M&A law today. A SPAC is a company that is formed for the sole purpose of raising capital through an IPO or for acquiring or merging with existing companies. Due to existing safe harbor protections and a lack of regulations, SPACs have come to widely be known as “blank check” companies.

Accordingly, SPACs have recently come under increased SEC scrutiny, with the agency proposing a number of new policies and regulations that would require more stringent disclosures for companies being acquired, relating to conflicts of interest, future financial projections, and more, aimed at better protecting potential investors.

The legal landscape surrounding SPACs is constantly shifting. To help you understand more, PLI is offering a one-day program, [The SPAC Life Cycle: Business, Legal and Accounting Considerations Forum 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/the-spac-life-cycle-business-legal-and-accounting-considerations-forum?t=live?tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), which will outline the purpose of SPACs and address the important business, legal, SEC reporting, and accounting considerations that arise in each phase of the complex SPAC lifecycle.

The key things you need to understand when dealing with SPACs include:

- How SPAC transactions are used as a vehicle for private companies to raise capital and become privately traded 
- How SPACs differ from traditional IPOs, and the pros and cons of each
- The typical lifecycle of a SPAC, from formation through SEC registration and IPO, and related legal issues
- The SPAC IPO transaction process
- Accounting and SEC reporting considerations
- Identification of an acquisition target
- Accounting and reporting requirements after an acquisition is complete
- The major SEC enforcement and litigation developments relating to SPACs
As their use becomes more common, SPACs will continue to garner increased attention in the corporate and M&A spheres. In turn, we can expect to see even more attention and regulation from the SEC and other regulatory bodies in the future. [Sign up](https://www.pli.edu/programs/the-spac-life-cycle-business-legal-and-accounting-considerations-forum?t=live?tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) for the program today to gain a comprehensive introduction to this complex new area of law.

I know it’s only May 6th, but what with the COVID-19 global pandemic portending the end times (seriously, there are murder hornets now), February 13th seems like a lifetime ago, but it was only a few months ago. Back then, one of the big stories on Above the Law was the tale of[ Dennis Duffy, the butt-shaking Biglaw partner.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/biglaw-partners-alleged-butt-shaking-gets-him-in-hot-water/?rf=1)

For those of you who don’t remember (and honestly, I wrote the story about him and I barely recalled the details), Duffy was a partner in the Houston office of BakerHostetler and represented Chevron in an employment discrimination case. The plaintiff’s attorney in the case was Alfonso Kennard Jr. of Kennard Law PC. Kennard filed a motion for sanctions and disqualification for Duffy’s “intolerable conduct” during a mediation which allegedly included Duffy “shaking his behind” in front of Kennard. Additionally, the filing alleged Duffy mocked Kennard’s ponytail and intimated that because of the hairstyle, Kennard would want to have sex with Duffy.

Now U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal has [ruled on the motion](https://www.law.com/2020/05/05/butt-shaking-houston-lawyer-escapes-sanctions-but-is-no-longer-a-bakerhostetler-partner/) for sanctions, and erm, she isn’t happy about it, opening her decision with, “One of the sentences a judge does not imagine—much less welcome—writing includes the words ‘butt shaking’ in describing a lawyer’s alleged actions at a mediation. Sadly, those words fit here.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But ultimately Judge Rosenthal decided not to levy sanctions on Duffy. She noted that there was significant disagreement over what actually happened at the infamous mediation and said, “While Duffy’s behavior was clearly outside professional bounds, neither counsel was a role model of professional conduct.” She went on:

“No further or formal sanction is necessary at this point. Duffy has had to withdraw. Before he did so, he received national press coverage when the sanctions motion ‘went viral.’ Duffy’s professional reputation, and the closely related ability to attract new business, will no doubt suffer, and they should.”

And on the subject of Duffy’s professional consequences, he is no longer employed at BakerHostetler. As of last month, [he works at Kane Russell Coleman Logan](https://www.krcl.com/attorney/dennis-duffy/) in Houston.

You can read the judge’s full order below.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to data collected by Refinitiv, which Biglaw firm topped the legal industry with the most in total Mergers & Acquisitions deal value in 2022?

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Hint: The firm worked on over $516 billion in total deals in 2022, but that number was down from the 2021 total deal value of nearly $740 billion in 2021.

Paul Rawlinson

[Big news](https://www.thelawyer.com/bakers-chair-rawlinson-to-take-temporary-leave-due-to-exhaustion/) for those that follow the comings and goings in Biglaw management. The Global Chair of Biglaw firm Baker McKenzie,[ Paul Rawlinson](https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/people/r/rawlinson-paul), announced he’s taking temporary medical leave for issues caused by exhaustion. Taking over as Acting Chair is [Jaime Trujillo](https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/people/t/trujillo-caicedo-jaime-e), a partner in Mergers & Acquisitions and the firm’s Latin America Chair.

A spokesperson for the firm provided this statement:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Baker McKenzie Global Chair Paul Rawlinson has announced that he will be stepping back from his day-to-day responsibilities and taking temporary leave to focus on a personal medical issue.

Based on the advice of his doctor, in response to medical issues caused by exhaustion, Paul has decided to take a step back from Firm leadership and client responsibilities to make his health and recovery his immediate priority.

In the interim, Baker McKenzie has appointed Jaime Trujillo to serve as the Firm’s Acting Chair. Jaime will work closely with other members of Baker McKenzie’s Executive Committee to continue to guide the Firm forward. Jaime is Baker McKenzie’s Latin American Chair and is an M&A lawyer by background. He joined the Firm in 1985. Everyone at Baker McKenzie sends best wishes to Paul and his family for a quick and full recovery, and we look forward to welcoming him back soon.

Out of respect for Paul and his family, we are unable to provide any additional details at this time.

Rawlinson has had a lot to deal with over the last few months. Baker McKenzie had its [own #MeToo scandal](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-firm-under-investigation-for-failing-to-disclose-partners-alleged-sexual-assault-to-regulators/) when it was revealed the firm responded to an associate’s allegation of sexual assault against a partner by sanctioning, but not firing, the partner in question. The firm recently [released a report](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/biglaw-firm-admits-it-botched-handling-of-sexual-assault-allegation-against-a-partner/) on its handling of that allegation and the firm admitted to “a number of shortcomings… which we very much regret.”

The firm has also faced reports of sinking morale after a [retroactive policy change](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/associate-bonus-watch-biglaw-firm-retroactively-changes-bonus-rules-associates-left-with-50-to-80-percent-of-expected-bonus/) jacked bonuses for associates, and then they [doubled down by blaming associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/facing-mounting-pressure-over-shortchanging-attorneys-baker-mckenzie-doubles-down-and-blames-associates/).

Best wishes to Rawlinson for a speedy recovery.

# Biglaw Bonuses Blossom This Spring As Another Major Biglaw Firm Announces Special Bonuses
## More bonuses are sprouting up in Biglaw!

Leo Tolstoy may have said spring is the time of plans and projects, but in Biglaw — at least in 2021 — it’s also the time of bonuses.

Yes, another Biglaw firm has announced a second round of special bonuses ([last fall marked the first round](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/)) to thank associates for their hard work during the tumultuous season of COVID-19 — which has turned out to be pretty profitable for the top of the legal sector. Yesterday, Cleary Gottlieb announced they too would match the spring special bonus scale [set earlier this week by Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/).

Below is the schedule Cleary will use to hand out bonuses:

The pandemic has turned many people’s dining room tables into workplaces. Attorneys are no exception. What’s more, no one expects the legal industry to return to the pre-pandemic norm. A recent survey by the American Bar Association revealed that only 23 percent of the lawyers surveyed wanted to return to the office full time. The rest would like to see remote work or a hybrid situation become the new paradigm.

These survey results were shared by Prof. Ben Sachs of the University of Virginia School of Law at the [Practising Law Institute’s program, “Managing Remote and Hybrid Legal Teams: Tactics to Thrive and Lead in the New World of Work.”](https://www.pli.edu/programs/managing-remote-and-hybrid-legal-teams--tactics-to-thrive-and-lead-in-the-new-world-of-work?tCode=AMB1_ATL20&utm_source=ATL20&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=AMB1) Sachs, who is also president of the training and consulting firm The Landing Group, noted in the seminar that people are leaving their jobs at unprecedented rates.

“[O]ne of the things that’s driving those decisions is how much work-life balance they can get back,” Sachs said. “If you can have a great culture that supports hybrid and remote work, you’ve got an edge in recruiting. You’re going to have great happy teams and you’re going to deliver better work to clients, but there are some costs.”

The ABA survey showed that employees put in nearly an extra day of work per week after going remote. Also, women were 46 percent more likely to say the pandemic made it harder to keep work separate from home life. 

“So, there’s a real burnout risk. If not handled properly, we can create real problems for our firms,” Sachs said.

With good planning, however, these costs can be mitigated. He grouped the techniques he presented under three headings: be intentional, build documentation, and evaluate regularly. 

Be Intentional

When everyone worked in the office, Sachs explained, firms often relied on serendipity to resolve problems. If there was an email miscommunication, it could be resolved by running into someone by the coffee machine. A “distributed” work team (which can be fully remote or hybrid) can’t rely on chance encounters.

“We’ve got to be more intentional,” Sachs said.

This means deciding the culture you want and thinking structurally about how you’re going to implement that culture. This process will yield benefits even if everyone eventually goes back into the office. “If you do this right, your team will be more productive than they ever were.” 

The first item on the “be intentional” checklist is to make sure you address the career growth of employees, so they remain invested in the work and the firm.

“On most of the teams I worked with . . . that happened through casual conversations,” Sachs said. Remote work gives you the chance to set up a mechanism where this happens deliberately, to ensure no one is overlooked and everyone is heard. He suggested meetings dedicated to career growth every one to two quarters.

Sachs said this time should be scheduled separately from everything else, so it doesn’t devolve into a discussion of the latest brief. He provided prompts to help structure the conversation. 

Being intentional about how leaders divide work also ensures balance across the team. “Keep an actual spreadsheet of who’s doing what. Use project management software, if you can. And when you think about assigning new tasks, go back to that and make sure you’re doing so evenly,” he said.

Finally, Sachs cited the importance of advocacy in remote work environments. Although there is a tendency to remind employees to advocate for themselves, Sachs emphasized the importance of advocating for others to ensure no one falls through the cracks.

Advocacy builds empathy among co-workers, as does social interaction. While opportunities to socialize are challenging when people aren’t in the office regularly, Sachs said it’s crucial.

“It turns out data have shown [that social interactions] make our teams better in every way,” Sachs said. “People are more engaged in their jobs. They’re more productive in their work. They do higher-quality work. They stay at the firm or on the team longer, which is a huge benefit to everybody. And they require less time off for illness or stress. That last one really got me. They require less time off due to illness, meaning they either get sick less or get over it faster if you foster social connections and social support systems.”

Sachs offered techniques for incorporating social conversations into existing meetings, such as intentionally leaving space for small talk before getting to business during a Zoom meeting or carving out the first few minutes of weekly team meetings for people to share highlights and low-lights from their week. He also suggested remote meetings scheduled specifically for social activities like games. Sachs said that while these “remote social” activities may seem silly at first, they are effective. They create personal bonds.

The last suggestion Sachs offered, especially for teams with little or no time in the office: hold larger in-person events two to four times per year, pandemic permitting. Like traditional offsite events, these events can bring remote team members together for both bonding and bigger-picture work.

Another thing a hybrid team is likely to appreciate is cutting back on useless meetings. If a team can resolve an issue by email, do it. If a meeting is necessary, make sure the person attending remotely isn’t an afterthought. And while Sachs thinks that meetings are best with cameras to build that sense of connection, he also noted that Zoom fatigue is a real physiological phenomenon.

In addition, Zoom meetings can induce what is called mirror anxiety. “Studies show that 60-plus percent of the time you’re staring at yourself in a meeting, and that creates anxiety,” Sachs said. Allowing some “off-camera” breaks or having entire meetings off camera can help offset these effects, although these should be the exceptions, he counseled. 

Finally, firms should be intentional about using the right tools for remote meetings. 

“The worst thing you can do is go up to a whiteboard,” Sachs said, “and then try to point a laptop camera at the whiteboard for the remote participants. Please don’t do that. Go digital.”

Digital technology gives us tools to help with these problems, Sachs added. Digital whiteboards allow users to drag and drop-boxes similar to PowerPoint and project management software can organize information for your teams and allow them to share documents.

Build Documentation

Sachs asked a fundamental question: “Why do we make ‘osmosis’ the way we learn [how to work with] a team?” A new employee may need to learn the existence and location of templates, information about managers, the way to communicate vacation plans, and expectations for weekend work availability. 

Law firms could take a tip from the military, Sachs said. It has protocols for everything, so when a new team comes together, its members can more easily begin to work because expectations are clear.

Easy access to information is especially important during onboarding, Sachs continued, describing a “hybrid-team handbook” — a set of resources in a central destination, such as a folder on a shared drive.

“That first week when someone’s onboarding a new team, they’re drinking from the fire hose,” he said. “You’ve told them a lot of things they will never remember. When we document it, they’re way more likely to go back to this resource and find what they need.”

Another important thing a firm can do for hybrid and remote workers is to create team bios. “I don’t just mean a list of names and emails,” Sachs said. “There’s a lot more to it than that.” Sachs described a “Working with Me” page as a tool to help team members navigate each other’s working styles. It can answer questions like — what are your typical hours at your desk? Pet peeves? Do you prefer chat, phone, or text for quick questions? As well as other questions about our typical ways of working.

Sachs explained that rather than making team members learn these things slowly by trial and error, they can share working styles transparently from day one. “Just put it in the handbook, and now everyone has access to the same information.” 

Evaluate Regularly

Of course, all this documentation will accomplish nothing unless you keep an eye on effectiveness. One of the challenges with a remote or hybrid team is knowing when it needs help. Taking the temperature is much easier when everyone is in the office, so hybrid teams need different tools.

Sachs urged watching for signs like a lack of accountability, a lack of productive conflict (such as challenging each other’s ideas), people failing to feel ownership of their work, and a lack of trust. If allowed to fester, these weaknesses slowly “eat away at the system,” Sachs said. 

The challenge, Sachs said, is how to ensure these problems are brought to the surface early, especially in remote and hybrid environments where leaders may not have visibility into the day-to-day frustrations of the team. He suggested periodic short surveys “to identify pain points around remote work and hybrid work.”

Next, he described “retros,” team discussions focused on what has and has not been effective on a given project after the project has been completed.

Once the issues have been brought to the surface, Sachs suggested trying different problem-solving approaches than those typically employed at law firms. “Hackathons” are an idea Sachs borrowed from the tech world. These are something akin to brainstorming sessions — trying to come up with solutions in a short time. 

“Instead of saying, ‘Let’s assign a committee,’ and have that committee meet for one hour a week for the next six weeks,” Sachs suggested trying accelerated timeframes, such as clearing the schedule for eight hours so that the team can build uninterrupted momentum and end the day with more progress than a length committee process might yield. 

Sachs’s final suggestion to ensure ongoing evaluation is to assign a task force to oversee all these processes, an evergreen committee that can last for months or years, with different people cycling in and out. 

“Junior associates are great for this,” Sachs said, adding that it’s in the interest of any person engaged in remote or hybrid work to focus on making it better. However, he believes managing all this is going to get harder before it gets better as firms navigate the transition.

As a parting comment, Sachs urged people to remember that “remote work brings out an organization’s lack of organization. If you’re thoughtful about how you build your team, you’re going to build a great team regardless of where they work.”

# Legal Sector Loses 1,100 Jobs In October
## How much should you freak out?

On Friday the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its jobs numbers for October. Though the overall outlook was fairly rosy with reported job gains in the U.S. and a slight decrease in the national unemployment rate. But that isn’t what happened in the legal sector. Legal jobs were down 1,100 for the month.

Now if you’re in law school or on the hunt for a job as an attorney, how much should you freak out? Well, as the BLS defines the legal services sector it includes paralegals, legal secretaries and other members of a law firm’s staff. As Law.com [points out](http://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/03/110317jobs/), there’s been a spate of Biglaw staff reductions recently that are likely driving the numbers:

October’s employment figures follow reports of staff reductions at large law firms over the past few months. Those reports include a cut of 17 administrative staff confirmed in July by Stoel Rives, a Portland, Oregon-based Am Law 200 firm that said at the time it was embarking on a strategic revamp of its operations.

Hogan Lovells, which was also reducing jobs in the U.K., recently offered voluntary retirement packages to about 400 business staff in the United States. The firm later confirmed that as much as 12 percent of its staff accepted those packages, meaning about 45 employees were impacted, according to the National Law Journal. In September, reports emerged that Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy was offering buyout packages to legal secretaries ahead of the firm’s plan to move its New York office to Hudson Yards, a real estate development on Manhattan’s west side.

BLS also made a downward adjustment to its legal services job numbers for September and August.

Law firms are increasingly looking for ways to reduce overhead and streamline their services. Buyouts and [layoffs for legal staff](https://abovethelaw.com/staff-layoffs/) have long been a part of that trend, and it doesn’t look like that will change any time soon.

Digging into which firms’ M&A departments had the best 2017 is the motivation behind [Big Law Business’s annual ranking](https://biglawbusiness.com/cleary-doubles-market-share-in-2017-ma-rankings/) of law firms by M&A deal volume. In the latest edition of the ranking, there was a good deal of reshuffling at the top of the list, but by far the biggest move was made by Cleary Gottlieb, which doubled its market share in 2017:

But one of the most striking moves came from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, which doubled its market share to claim spot 3 with a slew of big-dollar deals. The firm advised principals on just 85 deals with a total value of $259 billion.

“2017, from our perspective, was a year where a lot of companies did arguably their most important transactions in a long time, and that plays into our strength,” partner Ethan Klingsberg told Big Law Business.

These rankings only include the work done for the corporations buying a target or selling to a buyer — no credit is given for a firm that just advised a bank or investment firm in those transactions. Even Bloomberg — the creator of the ranking — recognizes the limitations of the methodology:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Of course, the year-to-year rankings of law firms provide a snapshot of their M&A performance and should be taken with a grain of salt. For example, some firms may have been quite busy in 2017 working on large deals that won’t be announced until this year, or they may have spent significant resources helping clients ward off a takeover. They could be billing significant hours on these matters, but it won’t get them on the league tables.

Still, the data provides a clear metric to rank the firms by — and who doesn’t like a good old fashioned ranking? So, without further ado, the Top 10 Law Firms by M&A Deal Volume in 2017:

Law Firms By M&A Deal Volume (2017)
Rank	Firm	Market Share (%)	Volume USD (Mln)
1	Skadden	17.5	$429,983
2	Simpson Thacher	10.7	$263,012
3	Cleary Gottlieb	10.5	$259,385
4	Allen & Overy	9.4	$232,019
5	Kirkland & Ellis	9.0	$220,729
6	Davis Polk	8.6	$211,600
7	Freshfields	7.9	$195,227
8	Wachtell	7.8	$193,241
9	Blake Cassels	7.4	$181,859
10	Sullivan & Cromwell	7.4	$181,098
The good news for law firms is that 2018 is also shaping up to be a banner year:

# The Biglaw Firms That Keep Opposing Counsel Running Scared In Litigation (2021)
## These cutthroat firms strike fear into the hearts of their opponents.

If you’re working in-house and dealing with bet-the-company litigation, you want the very best litigators in the world to be on your side. You want a firm with litigators so strong that opponents gasp in fear at the very mention of its name. You want a firm that is known internationally for going for the jugular and coming out on top.

But how can you ensure that you’ve picked the right firm? BTI Consulting Group just made it a little easier with the release of its annual ranking of the firms most likely to trigger dread in opposing counsel, as determined by a poll of in-house counsel. After reviewing all responses, BTI named the “Fearsome Foursome,” the most-feared litigation firms in the country.

So, which firms are being [honored this year](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/21-law-firms-clients-fear-most-in-litigation-post-pandemic) for their ability to strike fear in their opponents’ hearts and minds?

# Stat Of The Week: Commercial Chapter 11s Spike
## Bankruptcy lawyers can stop reading here and get back to work.

Bankruptcy lawyers who are living at work while working from home will likely remain swamped for the foreseeable future, according to data released this week. 

The legal services firm Epiq reported on Monday that in September 2020, new commercial Chapter 11 filings increased 78% versus September 2019, and that the first nine months of 2020 had one-third more filings than there were in the same period of the prior year. 

Epiq’s managing director of corporate restructuring, Deirdre O’Connor, adds some context in a statement:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“After a slower August, we see an increase in Chapter 11 filings in September both month over month and year over year. These commercial filings are primarily small businesses that do not have access to capital or stimulus. Unfortunately, those bankruptcies will continue to rise in the current economic environment. For the largest companies, opportunistic investors are providing much needed capital to supplement the lending capabilities of more constrained traditional banks. However, the most over-leveraged distressed companies could succumb to a formal restructuring due to lack of credit support and overall sector decline.”

Monday also saw the launch of the [Leopard Law Firm Index](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/index.php/leopard-law-firm-index/), a law firm rating tool that provides some insight into lateral hiring and other trends in practice areas including bankruptcy.

As law firms compete for this prized talent pool, the Leopard Index reveals that Cozen O’Connor is leading the Am Law 200 in one key metric, bringing on eight bankruptcy lateral partners in the past 12 months. 

It’s probably safe to say the new additions have hit the ground running.

# Let Them Eat Cake: An Inside Look At Women’s Attrition 
## For many women lawyers, myself included, at a certain point in life, the desire to pursue new challenges intersects with the courage to depart the steady track of the risk-averse Biglaw train.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on motherhood in the legal profession, in partnership with our friends at [MothersEsquire](https://www.mothersesquire.com/). Welcome Amy Bowen to our pages.

A few years ago, I assumed a label I’d previously shunned at all costs: quitter. After twelve years in Biglaw, I made the uncharacteristic decision to abandon the pie-eating contest before the final countdown.

The day I quit, I became part of a bothersome statistic: the number of women lawyers who never make it to the equity partner ranks. Around half of law firm associates are female, but [the percentage declines](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/gender%20equality/women%20in%20law%20firms/women-in-law-firms-final-103017.ashx) significantly at the nonequity partner level, and falls off the cliff to around 20% at the equity partner level.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Despite concerted efforts, the number of women [breaking the glass ceiling](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bonniemarcus/2018/06/15/forget-the-glass-ceiling-female-attorneys-now-face-a-concrete-wall/#189710df38f3) at law firms has barely budged in the past 20 years. 

Being part of this statistic stings, especially because the prevailing assumption is that women leave law firms because they can’t handle the stress or the workload. It’s not easy being a Biglaw lawyer, and it becomes even harder when you add children to the mix. I came very close to quitting after my umpteenth nervous breakdown, but if dealing with challenging time requirements and living in a perpetual state of overstress were dealbreakers, I would have resigned far, far earlier than I did.

And it’s often postulated that gender bias, lack of female leadership, and discrimination are contributors to the dearth of women at the top of the legal profession. I worked at one of the most “[female-friendly](https://ylw.yale.edu/history/)” law firms, and even there, these factors were inescapable.

But the creepy senior partner with the wandering eye (you know there’s one in every office!) did not deter me. Nor did the stark reality that I was one of a handful of women in a sea of men at my office’s monthly partner meetings, or the mortifying conversations I endured when navigating how to pump in the office upon returning from maternity leave.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Gender bias is most definitely at play in our profession. It’s a significant issue that we can’t ignore. But most women lawyers share a strong sense of obligation to do our part to break down biases. In all but extreme cases, it’s a factor that makes us want to dig in more than it sends us packing.

So what was my real reason for quitting? In vague terms, I felt compelled to leave because I wanted more.

As one [scholar](https://www.lawpracticetoday.org/article/what-women-want-law-firms/) of the attrition issue has aptly articulated, “a female attorney will leave her workplace — even one in which she thrives financially and professionally — if she cannot align her practice with her values and aspirations.” For many women lawyers, myself included, at a certain point in life, the desire to pursue new challenges intersects with the courage to depart the steady track of the risk-averse Biglaw train. I believe this quest for authenticity and alignment underlies a significant portion of the attrition statistics.

The [mindset shift](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/well/family/reframing-mommy-brain.html) that occurs when you become a mother isn’t all about deprioritizing work in favor of caring for children. At some point, it culminates in a broader world view and a desire for more — whether it’s more success, more balance, more autonomy, more progress, or more of something you can’t quite pinpoint when you’re in the thick of it. Moms are tough, uncompromising, and fearless.

And lawyer moms are all about efficiency. As much as they care about helping break the glass ceiling, they know that it isn’t necessary when they can fly in another direction.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When I made the decision to give up my Biglaw career, I could sense that there was more to the world than the treadmill I’d been on for what was becoming a substantial portion of my life. I knew, even before it was my reality, that I could “give up everything” and still survive — maybe even thrive.

Personally, I think the question should not be why women leave, but why more men don’t leave.

I suspect many men are trapped by persistent societal expectations surrounding gender roles. [Toxic masculinity](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-fight-toxic-masculinity/) runs rampant in the law firm environment. But in the same way some men not-so-secretly resent when women have children and gain an excuse to leave the office at 5 p.m. every day, I suspect they may (in many cases subconsciously) feel a tinge of jealousy when they see women walk out the door. [Emotional intelligence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-brain-and-emotional-intelligence/201104/are-women-more-emotionally-intelligent-men) empowers women to abandon the “safe” path — an action that men are, deep down, often too scared to take.

Looking behind the numbers to examine the deeper reasons for attrition is an important step in the discourse surrounding Biglaw’s gender divide. And it might just make things better for everyone involved.

To effectuate change, firms have to [delve into the dynamics of gender imbalance](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/women/walkoutdoor_online_042320.pdf) by addressing the cultural shifts necessary to foster intangibles like authentic connection, a sense of inspiration and empowerment, and acceptance of a broader set of goals and desires. 

I can vouch that “life on the other side” is easier — but I’ve pulled all-nighters in Biglaw, as a solo, and in my newest role as in-house counsel. None of it’s a [piece of cake](https://www.goldbelly.com/sugarees/15018-rainbow-cake). But at least it isn’t … more pie.

I’m still finding my way to whatever the highly driven part of my psyche will consider “success,” but in the meantime, the fulfillment I gain from the mindset of knowing I can start over, control my reality, and craft a career that comports with my, well, life — is something I’ll never give up.

[Amy Bowen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-bowen-340ba627/)[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-bowen-340ba627/) spent twelve years in the real estate group at Holland & Knight LLP before leaving to start a solo practice in 2017. Today, she balances her role as general counsel for [Builtech](https://builtechllc.com/), a national general contractor, with parenting two children, freelance commercial leasing work, and writing.

# Don't Hate Your Adversary For Making Your Life Harder
## Lawyers should not hold grudges against other lawyers, even when those other lawyers advance positions that create difficulties.

As many attorneys can attest, litigation is usually a very adversarial process. Oftentimes, litigation is a zero-sum game, and anything adversaries can gain for their clients is something that is taken away from your clients. Adversaries usually need to take hard and sometimes annoying positions in order to secure every advantage for clients. Although lawyers should not be easily forgiven for failing to extend simple courtesies, lawyers should not be too hard on their adversaries for taking positions that might make it more difficult for them or their clients.

Sometimes, lawyers need to make litigation more difficult so that the other side will see all of the resources that must be spent litigating a case and might be more willing to settle a matter. Settlement decisions are often business decisions that weigh all of the resources, time, and brain space that need to be devoted to a matter. Of course, lawyers cannot commit a course of action that has no other purpose than to harass the other side or delay litigation, but this does not mean that lawyers cannot pursue voluminous document production, additional depositions, and other discovery in the hopes that more information will be uncovered, and the other side will need to devote more resources to a matter.

Earlier in my career, I had a case in which my deponent was out of the country, and the deponent did not want to travel back in order to be deposed. Even before COVID-19, it was not uncommon for international deponents to give testimony virtually rather than travel long distances to be deposed. I asked my adversary if he would be willing to consent to depositions occurring virtually, and I offered him the option to conduct the deposition of his deponent virtually, so everyone was on an even playing field.

However, this attorney was insistent that the deposition occur in person. The other lawyer said that it is easier to handle exhibits and comprehend nonverbal cues if depositions occur in person. Even though this was the argument the lawyer was making, I understood that the lawyer also wanted to make the litigation harder on my deponent. If the deponent needed to spend a substantial amount of time and resources flying in order to be deposed, my client would be more likely to settle the case.

Initially, I was kind of peeved that the lawyer made us argue the issue in front of the court rather than just agree to a virtual deposition. After a while, I just accepted that the lawyer was doing what was probably best for his client, and I should not hold this against him. Although the episode did not help us promote courtesy in the litigation, I could understand where this lawyer was coming from.

Another situation in which lawyers sometimes make it harder on other lawyers is with document demands. Often, in litigation, lawyers demand an exceptionally large amount of documents that the other side needs to produce to each party to a case. Naturally, the expectations about what should be produced are never satisfied, because documents are not kept due to the passage of time, or they never existed in the first place. Even if a lawyer conducts extensive searches, the attorney may not find responsive documents even if a client should reasonably be expected to keep such records.

Earlier in my career, I was tasked with producing documents in a case, and I did everything I could to hunt down materials. I called my client and sent them the document demands so that they were familiar with the materials that needed to be produced. Then, I made several visits to my client’s office and personally conducted a search for the materials. After all of this work, I was able to produce thousands of pages of materials, and my client assured me that no other materials existed.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
However, my adversary was not satisfied with my production. Even after I explained all of the steps I had taken to secure the materials, he continued to insist that I was not being forthcoming with materials and he would go to the court and ask for preclusion orders or other relief. At first, I was peeved that the lawyer did not recognize all of the work I had done to secure the materials I produced.

However, I later thought that my adversary was just doing his job in opposing the quality and quantity of my document production. Indeed, a lawyer should rarely be satisfied with a document production since holes in a document production can form the basis of powerful relief issued by the court. In the end, I accepted that I did the best I could with the document production, and I was fine if the lawyer submitted the issue to the court.

As lawyers, it is beat into us that we should not dislike attorneys who represent unsavory clients because everyone needs a defense. Lawyers should also not hold grudges against lawyers who advance positions that make their lives more difficult. Often, adversaries are just advancing positions that give their clients the most advantages, and we are all probably guilty of making arguments that burden our adversaries.

# How Data Analytics Could Bring Home Appellate Victories
## How would you proceed in this hypothetical case?

The legal industry is filled with buzz about how the latest tech can help manage a firm more efficiently and more profitably. 

But what about legal tech specifically built to help your firm win big, appellate-level cases?

Why Data Matters

At the beginning of a recent webinar titled “Want To Get An Edge On Appeals? This Data Can Help,” Anne Wise Kann, project manager at legal analytics firm Lex Machina, presents viewers with a scenario: 

“In our hypothetical, I’m an attorney and I’ve been hired by a big box electronic store. My client is being sued in the Northern District of Georgia because the plaintiff claimed a big box fell on them in the Atlanta store. And, the district court has already found that our client was negligent and has ordered a damage award in favor of the plaintiff. Now the client wants to figure out our next move. Should we appeal this ruling?”

There are a myriad of factors to consider here, but they’re tied to a search for clues as to how the appellate court might respond to an appeal.

Answering that question is where data-based investigations can give attorneys an edge when it comes to making potentially high-risk decisions.

What Appellate Analytics Can Do for You

Wise Kann demonstrates the capabilities of Appellate Analytics, describing how it might assist the attorney in the scenario above and noting the types of information the program can provide. 

Users may access a vast amount of information, including comparisons of the reversal rates of judges in a particular circuit or even data related to cases that originated somewhere other than a traditional district court before moving to the appellate courts.

Fill out the form to view this webinar on-demand.

# ‘Legally Mocktail’ Your Holiday Event (With Recipies)
## Fun non-alcoholic drinks to add to your holiday party menu.

It’s that time of the year again. Holiday Parties. Spiked eggnog and lampshades against the backdrop of a legal profession replete with problem drinkers. Along with with that, the increased holiday risk of impaired driving, sexual misconduct, and the general, alcohol-fueled stupidity that ‘spikes’ each holiday season.

It makes sense now, more than ever, to re-evaluate how holiday parties are implemented from Biglaw to small law. Balance is crucial. The good news is that equilibrium can be established in a way that adds to the festivities, rather than “grinching it” with a limited alternative selection of a few liters of soft drinks and bottled water. Think hard about “Mocktailing” your upcoming event. To provide a “blueprint” for your new, incredible, mocktail bar, I reached out to Tanya Pitch, a long-time Dallas, event bartender. Here is her take with recipes!

Mocktails, or zero-proof cocktails, are gaining quite the following these days. Many restaurants are finding that their patrons prefer more options than just mundane sodas, juices, and water. Mocktails also are making their way into the private party scene as well. There is a misconception that nondrinkers are such a minority group that it isn’t worth the effort/investment to create viable options for them.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Providing a mocktail bar at your next party is an opportunity to surprise and delight your audience while making you the BEST host this holiday season. The easiest way to build your holiday party bar is to create a cocktail menu with the catering company you’ve hired.

Don’t assume that guests who want a non-alcoholic beverage have unsophisticated palates. Ask the catering company you hired to help you get creative when it comes to both drink menus. It’s usually best to build the cocktail and mocktail menus off of one another. This will cut down on costs because the ingredients can be used in both the non-alcoholic and alcoholic drink recipes.
If you stock your bar properly, the experienced bartenders will be able to make some unique off-menu drinks as well.

Also, please don’t skimp on glassware. Oftentimes, non-alcoholic drinks are served in flimsy plastic cups, while other guests enjoying their martinis sip out of polished glassware. Without even trying, your holiday party could make the non-drinkers feel like outliers of the crowd. But if you create a full bar just for them, that includes nice glassware, the feeling of inclusion will abound. Holding a drink in a plastic cup may make one feel like a kid at an adult party. But holding a drink in nice stemware that looks different than everyone else’s can give your guests an automatic conversation starter that could help their networking game, as well as lead to interesting discussions about alcohol in general.

A few other additional costs you may possibly incur while providing a separate mocktail bar, besides glassware, are: additional bar staff, extra ice, additional table/bar rentals and, extra linens. The zero-proof/mocktail bar is a great tool to encourage responsible drinking while still participating in the cocktail culture. After all, why should alcohol have all of the fun?  Here are a few potential legally themed recipe options for your upcoming holiday bash. They are yours to use. Feel free to create your own fun drink names!

# Are You Languishing?
## 'Meh' is the perfect word to describe that kind of nether world in which we find ourselves these days.

So, how you do feel these days? Ready to go back into the office? Prefer working from home for the foreseeable future? [Some firms have already](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/skadden-reopening-plan/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=129400037&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--BdUrPZyY0D4BbeD9_yGEGl2LvoQKghdMuC5N44mT4CN-9HZxmbilzn7uIgPloQsysji1Xk9y898ZgmNCpmYFZ_PpQ9w&utm_content=129400037&utm_source=hs_email) announced plans to reopen. Others have not finalized plans. It’s anyone’s guess how the return to work will roll out.

How are you feeling emotionally? If you are at all like so many of us, your answer would probably be “meh.” Not terrible, but not great. I think “meh” is the perfect word to describe that kind of nether world in which we find ourselves these days. “Blah” could also be another descriptive word right now.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Adam Grant is an organizational psychologist at Wharton and his term for what most, if not all, of us are feeling now is “[languishing](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html?searchResultPosition=1).” He says it’s a feeling of stagnation and emptiness. I think “stagnation” is certainly an appropriate word, given that most of us are totally over Zoom usage, and the last thing we want to do to is spend even one more minute on it. “Emptiness,” a sense perhaps that there is “no there there,” is also understandable. We feel a kind of joylessness and aimlessness.

We all know that we’re feeling that way. We’re tired, depleted, and weary.

Grant says that languishing is the middle stage between depression and flourishing. It would be no surprise at all if there are more mental health issues (at long last we are paying attention to them) in the post-pandemic, return to work world.

Languishing is not firing on all cylinders, it’s a lack of ability to concentrate and creates a sense of dullness of purpose, a going through the motions rather than being energized about what you are doing. None of this should be any surprise to any of us. Languishing is brain fog, the inability to see clearly, the lack of interest in people and things that have mattered to you in the past.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Grant says that one antidote to languishing is the concept of flow, that you become so immersed in a project or activity or, yes, even work, that you forget all sense of time, that hours pass, and you [don’t even know it](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3SRXTYW895E78&dchild=1&keywords=flow&qid=1621902190&s=books&sprefix=flow%2Caps%2C394&sr=1-1).

If you have never read the book “Flow,” do so. I think it’s an essential book to understand and use flow in your lives, both personal and professional, especially now in these pretty-close-to-post-pandemic times. I took a class from the author, [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi), more than 20 years ago at Claremont Graduate University.

Reading his book and taking his class were two of the most memorable educational experiences I have ever had. Grant has reminded me that it’s time for me reread Csikszentmihalyi’s book.

What flow does is take you out of yourself. You become so absorbed in whatever interests you, that makes you happy, content, or joyful at what you are doing that time flies without realizing that it has flown. I don’t think anyone would say that the past 15 or 16 months have been happy, contented, or joyous for anyone, and I think that Grant’s point is that it’s time to find flow.

One of the issues that we have all faced in the past year or so is the fragmentation of our attention: concern about loved ones near and far whom we couldn’t see and, in some cases, not even talk to. Giving children the attention, they needed and deserved while trying to keep them educated as they lost a whole year of social interaction and educational instruction. Trying to keep an even keel at your job (if you had one) while refraining from telling managers that you were not on call 24/7 even if working from home.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
How to handle all this?  Grant has some ideas:

- Set uninterrupted blocks of time. That is a way to get our attention, to do work that needs to be done, and that can create a sense of flow. Concentrate on whatever it is you are doing to the exclusion of the world around you.
- Focus on small goals. It doesn’t have to be a small professional goal; it can just as easily be a personal one, like writing that essay that you’ve been thinking about, finishing that book that you promised to return to your neighbor, or practicing a musical instrument. Take satisfaction in little things. Sounds a little New Age-y? So what?
Many of us have been living lives of “quiet despair” as Grant, paraphrasing Thoreau, calls it. So, it’s not about just the physical return to work, but the mental aspect as well. Physical presence is one thing, but what about mental presence? As Grant says, “As we head into our new post-pandemic reality, it’s time to rethink our understanding of mental health and well-being. ‘Not depressed’ doesn’t mean you’re not struggling. ‘Not burned out’ doesn’t mean you’re fired up.”

These pandemic times have much to teach us about mental health, how people use their coping mechanisms to survive difficult times now. Everyone has them, some more successful than others. We lawyers pride ourselves on our mental toughness, but perhaps our guard needs to be relaxed, even if just a little.

What’s especially important now is to acknowledge that you may well be languishing, and that’s okay. There’s been grief, heartbreak, frustration, anxiety, you name it, people have experienced it. Even if you have been lucky enough to avoid a bout of COVID-19, there’s still the emotional long haul that we’ve all been through. It’s a form of PTSD.

If there’s anything positive in all this, it’s that now, finally, people (and I include lawyers as people although some would disagree) are starting to take mental health issues seriously, that they shouldn’t be stigmatized any longer because just about everyone has been languishing. We need to regain our sense of equilibrium, but that doesn’t happen overnight.

# New Tulane 1L Is An Advocate, A Writer, And A Murderer
## You have probably never heard of Charles Russell, but he was a professor who was murdered in 1992. His attacker served 12 years in prison and admits his guilt. The man who killed Professor Russell is named Bruce Reilly. And after a lot of work, he was accepted into the Tulane Law School for the class of 2014. Does that sound like an amazing success story about a guy who has turned his life around? Well, you haven't heard Tulane Law students tell it....

[](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/09/new-tulane-1l-is-an-advocate-a-writer-and-a-murderer/tulane-law-logo/)Which of the nouns in the headline caught your attention? If you are a student at [Tulane Law School](https://abovethelaw.com/tulane-law-school/), I’m sure it was the murderer part.

Most of you have probably never heard of Charles Russell, but he was a professor at the Community College of Rhode Island who was [murdered in 1992](http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8246191.html). His attacker served 12 years in prison and admits his guilt.

The man who killed Professor Russell is named Bruce Reilly. After serving his time, Reilly turned his life around and became an advocate for criminal rights and prisoners’ rights. He worked for a group called [DARE – Direct Action for Rights and Equality](http://www.daretowin.org/). He is respected by colleagues. He has testified before the Rhode Island statehouse with the credibility of an expert. He wrote an award-winning screenplay. And after a lot of work, he was accepted into the Tulane Law School for the class of 2014.

Does that sound like an amazing success story about a guy who has turned his life around? Well, you haven’t heard Tulane Law students tell it.

Continue reading for statements from Tulane’s dean, Tulane Law students, friends of Bruce Reilly, and Bruce Reilly himself….


Reilly has thus far been pretty open with the Tulane Law community about his prior conviction. In fact, it appears his main problem with his fellow students is that they tend to gossip and talk about him behind his back, instead of directly asking him about what happened.

I know this because Reilly wrote a blog post to that effect. From his website, [Unprison](http://unprison.com/2011/09/11/google-criminal-records-and-cultural-disenfranchisement/):

Some of you may be reading this article subsequent to a Google search, and I strategically tagged it with metadata so you will be directed here. Perhaps you are the person whose Friend Request I ignored, as you may have tried that route to know me: look at all my photos, read my info, check my Wall, and know me as if we were tight since grade school. We live in a passive-aggressive culture of curiosity and fear. The former is an admirable trait, while the latter is what allows us to be controlled. Specific fear can save one’s life in a given circumstance, but generalized fear strips one of their independence. It tends towards “herd” mentality, and a devolution to the lowest common denominator. Fear is the feast of fascism.

Lets cut to the chase: I killed a man 19 years ago.

The post has some additional details about the murder, and far, far more details about how someone deals with having “murderer” as part of his Google footprint. For “art” on the post, Reilly chose a t-shirt that says: “F**k Google, ask me.”

Meet your new classmate, Tulane Law!

Reilly linked to that post on the Tulane Wall 1L Facebook page, and many of his classmates took the only reasonable next step to find out more information: they emailed Above the Law.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Now, don’t blame Tulane Law students. Sitting here thousands of miles away from Louisiana, I was more than comfortable asking Reilly a couple of questions to flesh this story out. But if I had been a Tulane 1L when I read Reilly’s post, I think the [Samuel L. Jackson voice](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/quotes?qt0447099) would have started playing in my head. And regardless of what Reilly wrote, I would have heard, “You wanna know if I killed a motherf**cker, you really wanna know? Ask me. I dare you, I double dare you, ask me if I killed someone one more goddamn time.”

The emails we received from Tulane Law students reflected a deep concern in the student body about their security at law school. Remember, we’re living in a world where somebody killed a recent [Mercer Law grad](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/lauren-giddings/) and a former classmate is the [prime suspect](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/08/more-on-stephen-mcdaniel-a-missing-bar-prep-session-and-possible-fiber-evidence/). This email from a Tulane 1L is indicative of many of the emails we received:

Are the students (such as myself) correct in being offended he was judged against us (and others) in the admissions process? Are students correct in being offended that he (allegedly) received a considerable amount of scholarship to offset the cost of the law school process? Are the students correct in being worried that, when placed in one of the most stress-inducing environments in the United States, Mr. Reilly will reach his tipping point and live up to his violent past, pulling a Virginia Tech-esque move and harming fellow students? I feel that the answer to each of these questions is in the affirmative.

However, I am sure the law school in question had none of these concerns in mind when admitting the convicted murderer. Instead, they granted him admission, and (once again, allegedly) encouraged him to attend by offering a substantial scholarship, which is aided by the scholarship provided by the NAACP. Furthermore, it is of the opinion of this writer, as well as other students, the school was in the opinion that they would be hailed as being on the cutting edge of legal education, admitting convicted murderers (deemed as a “psychopathic master manipulator” by the state of Rhode Island) into their school, to be in close proximity not only with other law students, but also the undergraduates on campus.

Lastly, I would like to stress that it is simply unconscionable that the law school would admit such a student, knowing he would never be allowed to sit for the bar in any state. With the economy suffering in the way it is, as well as current graduates having a hard time finding it impossible to sit for the bar due to parking tickets, bad credit and the like, is it admissible for a law school to admit a student on the basis they can pay tuition, knowing their options as an attorney are extremely limited, at best?

As you can see, there is a lot going on here. The fear is obvious. And there are all the usual concerns about the tight job market and the reputation of a law school that admits, well, convicted murderers.

Some of these concerns are certainly legitimate. For instance, we are talking about a person who killed a professor (I haven’t seen anything that goes to motive), and we are talking about a particularly stressful educational environment.

The first thing you have to ask is, why would Tulane take this risk? Lawyers are risk-averse by nature. Law students are stressed enough without a convicted murderer on campus. As one Tulane student gchatted to me: “I think felons should get a second chance, but why at Tulane? What are we, the law school for murderers and footwear thieves?”

The last line refers to [Tulane’s glorious history](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/10/tulane-law-school-showing-mr-rogers-how-they-roll-in-mr-robinsons-neighborhood/) on Above the Law. Let’s just say that Tulane seems to admit students with some, well, personality.

I asked Tulane Law Dean [David Meyer](http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsabout/index.aspx?id=1138) many of these questions (not so much about the school’s glorious history). He wasn’t able to address the Reilly situation specifically, but here’s what he had to say:

In our admissions process, we take seriously the task of evaluating applicants as individuals, taking into account all available information bearing on each applicant’s character, life story, talents, and future ambitions. Our process insists on evidence that applicants, whatever their background, have demonstrated a commitment to fulfilling the ideals of the legal profession. It also allows for the possibility of redemption even in exceptional circumstances of tragedy and hardship. In all cases, we admit candidates only if we are confident that they will genuinely enrich our community and hold high promise of success as lawyers. I am extremely proud of the Tulane Law Class of 2014 and have high expectations of their future achievements.

Best wishes,
David Meyer

Let us know if Dean Meyer updates the student body in any way after this post goes live. We’ll be happy to include additional thoughts from the administration in this post.

Fundamentally, the Dean’s response has to be viewed as supportive of Bruce Reilly. That support was made a little more vocal by the people who know him. I spoke with a couple of people who worked with Reilly, and they were firmly in his corner.

One friend said that Reilly is “the nicest guy you’ll ever meet,” as well as “the best, most articulate person to testify. He is good at crystallizing arguments.”

That sounds like a recipe for a good law student.

This friend went on to to say that he had absolutely no safety concerns, ever, while working with Reilly. “He has an adorable daughter… I’ve been to his house!”

Another person who worked with Reilly said simply: “Take all s**t talk from people who haven’t met a guy with a pound of salt.” This friend believes that Reilly, through his work with [DARE](http://www.daretowin.org/), really found his path.

By the time I caught up with Reilly, I had one question that stood out above all the others. It’s probably the same question that most lawyers had since reading the title of this post (and something Dean Meyer declined to address): How, in the hell, can this guy pass a character and fitness exam?

Here was Reilly’s response to that:

By the time I apply to a state or federal bar, my last criminal activity will be as a teenager, and over two decades passed. I will be presenting a model case for rehabilitation, an impressive résumé, and a substantial list of esteemed supporters. I have found that a majority of our society believes in forgiveness and second chances, and all I can do is keep doing what I’m doing. I made it this far, so I have no reason to believe that I will be denied in the future. Whether I pass the bar or not, I will put my degree to good use.

Oh, and it’s not like Reilly let Tulane off the hook in any way. Dean Meyer is going to have to own this admission, for better or worse:

Anyone who applies to an ABA-accredited law school is required to provide detailed accounts of any criminal convictions. Omissions will likely eliminate any chances of passing the bar, and should surely earn an eviction from law school. Similarly, a guy working at Home Depot who doesn’t divulge their marijuana possession will be fired if the manager does a background check later on. To suggest I wasn’t forthcoming with Tulane is ludicrous.

Reilly’s full email to ATL is reprinted below. I must admit that I’m rooting for Reilly. I mean, what is the point of having a prison system that ever lets people out if those EX-convicts are not to be allowed to try and succeed on the outside? If I am forced to watch Michael Vick prance around every Sunday getting praised and getting rich, why can’t a murderer turn his life around and go to law school?

Here’s Reilly’s response when I asked if him what he would say to the classmates who are worried about going to school with a convicted murderer:

History teaches us that the greatest fear has always been of “the unknown.” I understand that some of my classmates have probably never had any known interactions with people who have committed a violent crime or been imprisoned. Our perceptions of violence are often skewed by what is sanctioned, and what is not. Are they more in danger from me, or someone who recently was given a medal for a violent act they were commanded to commit, yet who is also in heavy counseling (and possibly self-medicating) over it?

Okay, Bruce, I’m not sure if you are familiar with the movie Ghostbusters, but if someone asks if you are a danger to you colleagues, you say “No!” Not “Am I more dangerous than a Marine?? [pregnant pause] ?? [answer not found].” Seriously man, I think we all get the existential “what is danger” point you were trying to make, but you have to understand that you are now in school with some mad uptight people.

That’s really the story here. It’s probably still a tragedy for Charles Russell’s survivors (whom I did not contact for this story on the thought that if they don’t know about this, they don’t need to know). For good or ill, it speaks to Tulane Law’s reputation. But the unknown that is about to happen right now is that you are about to throw a person with a completely non-traditional set of experiences into a law student community.

Reilly wants to make existential points about being on the ass end of the criminal justice system; the girl sitting next to him is thinking, “I don’t want to get stabbed.” One guy is concerned about how it’ll look to have a J.D. from Tulane College of Convicts; Reilly is wondering whether his J.D. will be the capstone on his rebuilt life. Reilly isn’t even speaking the same language as his fellow classmates.

Then again, maybe there is common ground Reilly can find with others at Tulane Law. Reilly said, “Whether I pass the bar or not, I will put my degree to good use.”

So, see, he hasn’t figured that the point of law school is to get a law job, just like most of the rest of the 1Ls.

BRUCE REILLY — STATEMENT ON LAW SCHOOL

I decided to go to law school because my advocacy work often reaches a bump in the road when I need to find a pro bono lawyer. Having been working in the law for nearly two decades with only myself for a teacher, I am excited for the opportunity to glean from an historic institution like Tulane. I have many colleagues and connections around the country who are excited and inspired by my work thus far, and this is yet another opportunity for society to learn that we need everybody involved if we are truly going to build a strong and equitable community.

History teaches us that the greatest fear has always been of “the unknown.” I understand that some of my classmates have probably never had any known interactions with people who have committed a violent crime or been imprisoned. Our perceptions of violence are often skewed by what is sanctioned, and what is not. Are they more in danger from me, or someone who recently was given a medal for a violent act they were commanded to commit, yet who is also in heavy counseling (and possibly self-medicating) over it?

It is worth noting that they are entering a field where it is common to interact with people who have committed crimes. My presence may serve as a valuable experience for them. My best suggestion is they speak to those who do not fear me, and ask how they process the situation. New Orleans has 22,000 people currently on probation, and hundreds more on parole, yet more crimes will be committed by those not within the system. Lack of awareness regarding life in the big city does not make someone safe, it merely massages their perception.

By the time I apply to a state or federal bar, my last criminal activity will be as a teenager, and over two decades passed. I will be presenting a model case for rehabilitation, an impressive resume, and a substantial list of esteemed supporters. I have found that a majority of our society believes in forgiveness and second chances, and all I can do is keep doing what I’m doing. I made it this far, so I have no reason to believe that I will be denied in the future. Whether I pass the bar or not, I will put my degree to good use.

Anyone who applies to an ABA accredited law school is required to provide detailed accounts of any criminal convictions. Omissions will likely eliminate any chances of passing the bar, and should surely earn an eviction from law school. Similarly, a guy working at Home Depot who doesn’t divulge their marijuana possession will be fired if the manager does a background check later on. To suggest I wasn’t forthcoming with Tulane is ludicrous.

It’s been a busy week for Republican Speakers of the House. Paul Ryan announced that he will retire from Congress at the end of his term before he can get tagged with the massive deficit he created, John Boehner is a full-throated supporter of marijuana legalization after the industry paid him a metric ton of cash to whore for them engaging in deep reflection on the tragedy of non-violent drug offender convictions, and Dennis Hastert wondered if any cable news network would reach out and book him for an expert opinion on paying hush money. Not wanting to be left out of the action, former Speaker Newt Gingrich has leapt into the headlines with news that he’ll be leaving Dentons.

Gingrich, who is not a lawyer, worked with Dentons for three years as — functionally if not formally — a lobbyist [NOTE: A spokesperson for Gingrich wrote to confirm that the former Speaker explicitly informed clients that he was not serving as a lobbyist (e.g. he would not be making phone calls on their behalf). That’s the purpose of the word “functionally” above — we understand that he never registered as a lobbyist, but he was working with a group that provided public policy and regulatory advice, the skills sought from a Biglaw “small-l” lobbying group.] Ryan Lovelace of the National Law Journal reports:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“The firm and Speaker Gingrich have concluded a formal three year relationship. We thank Speaker Gingrich for his contributions to the Firm’s client service,” the firm said in a statement.

Mike McNamara, Dentons’ CEO in the U.S., delivered the news to the firm’s U.S. partnership in an internal email early Monday that also directed people on how to best address pending matters involving Gingrich.

Whether Dentons forced the issue or Gingrich decided to quit of his own accord is unknown, but in either event, Paul Ryan’s decision to step away from politics certainly played a role. Once you skirt past the platitudes about “spending more time with my family,” Ryan’s announcement basically let every lingering doubter know that they expect to lose control of the House, rendering Gingrich next to useless as a lobbyist someone giving public policy advice to clients on how to deal with government. Boehner’s turn as a hippie at least gives him some bi-partisan credibility. Pending a comparably dramatic turn, Gingrich has nothing to bring to the table.

Until then, Gingrich can look forward to a starring role in “explain why this isn’t impeachable yet a blow job was?” his recurring tour de force performance on cable news.

“Super Bowl goals / My wife in the crib feeding my kids liquid gold / we in a whole different mode.” — [Jay-Z](https://genius.com/Jay-z-family-feud-lyrics)

Last week, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) revealed some [surprising statistics](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2017/people-organization-behavior-culture-getting-the-most-from-diversity-dollars.aspx) from its most recent research regarding gender diversity in the workplace.

BCG surveyed roughly 17,500 employees and interviewed more than 200 senior executives at companies in various industries across 21 countries, seeking their perspective on 39 specific diversity initiatives.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
For law firms seeking to [stretch their diversity spending and generate a higher ROI](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2017/people-organization-behavior-culture-getting-the-most-from-diversity-dollars.aspx), BCG’s findings lead to three specific conclusions:

- Law firms need to know which measures are the most effective in addressing diversity and inclusion problems. BCG refers to underestimated measures that lead to significant results as “Hidden Gems.”
- Law firms need to understand their particular underlying issues. In many cases, senior leaders (particularly men) and the women who work for them have dramatically different perspectives on diversity and inclusion issues.
- Law firms need to test the ROI of programs and impose a minimum bar for new ideas. BCG’s report “is a call to action for companies to run diversity programs with the same rigor that they would apply to any other major commercial priority.” In other words, implementation is critical.
In its report, BCG delineated gender diversity initiatives into four clusters: Hidden Gems, Proven Measures, Baseline Measures, and Overrated Measures.

I found the “Overrated Measures” category quite interesting. Here, men rank the effectiveness of these measures as “high,” but women rate the effectiveness of these measures as “low.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“These initiatives appear promising on paper, tend to be fairly easy to launch, and often involve short-term bouts of focused effort,” according to BCG. Overrated Measures include:

- Holding one-time-only training sessions – too frequently outsourced and isolated events, and not enough to reshape an organizational culture.
- Establishing grievance systems – necessary for egregious actions, but typically insufficient to change women’s daily experience.
- Incentivizing senior leaders – usually gets lost among long list of leadership targets.
- Recruiting senior role models – not a quick fix for failure of the organic pyramid.
The “Proven Measures” category consists of known measures with proven ROI. According to [BCG’s Global Gender Diversity Survey 2017](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2017/people-organization-behavior-culture-getting-the-most-from-diversity-dollars.aspx), the top five strategies for improving gender diversity are:

- Formal Flexible Work Policies.
- Anti-Discrimination Policies.
- Role Model Visibility.
- Public Commitment.
- Informal Flexibility.
Does your law firm currently have any of these policies in place? If not, BCG has provided a compelling business case to initiate such an intervention.

The first half of 2017 has now passed. Is your law firm making headway in its diversity and inclusion goals? Or has 2017 thus far served as a reminder of more of the same?

Business as usual can no longer be an excuse for sticking with the [status quo](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/can-millennials-disrupt-the-biglaw-status-quo-bias-toward-diversity/).

If BCG’s report is truly a call to action for organizations to run diversity programs with the same rigor that they would apply to any other major priority, then law firms will need to comprehend that diversity is more than a buzzword—it is essential to running a [successful business](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/5-takeaways-from-mckinseys-diversity-matters-report-for-the-legal-profession/).

Ulf Johannemann, the once Global Head of Tax at the Biglaw firm Freshfields, has been sentenced to three and a half years in jail by a German court.

At issue was tax advice Johannemann provided to his client Maple Bank. He devised a mechanism for the company to claim a tax credit they hadn’t paid. According to prosecutors, Johannemann’s advice gave the scheme a “supposedly legal appearance.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The ex-tax chief was in court in connection with expert opinions he gave from 2006-09 endorsing the so-called ‘Cum Ex’ trading scheme to a client, Maple Bank (now-defunct). The tax arrangement involved treating a share as having two owners, so that both parties could receive a refund of capital gains tax which only one of them had actually paid.

The Cum Ex tax-dodge, signed off by Johannemann, enabled Maple Bank to reclaim EUR383 million in tax which it never paid. When German authorities decided the scheme was unlawful they closed down the German arm of Maple bank. The bank’s administrators sued the firm, and Freshfields (or its insurers) paid out EUR50 million to settle the claim. Freshfields also paid a voluntary EUR10 million to the German tax authority in 2021, in a deal to avoid any prosecution over its advice to Maple Bank.

The firm has attempt to distance themselves from their former partner — Johannemann left the firm in 2019, shortly before his arrest. A firm spokesperson made the following statement:

“Freshfields was not a party to these proceedings and will not be commenting on the outcome. We continue to work with the authorities, within the boundaries of our professional obligations, in an effort to learn from and draw a line under these matters.”

Johannemann can appeal the sentence.

# Gibson Dunn Second Biglaw Firm To Cower From Threatened Affirmative Action Suit

Knew we could count on you!

The SFFA v. Harvard decision restricted universities and colleges’ use of affirmative action to build more diverse student bodies. Immediately after, Republican groups began using it as a cudgel against law firms, med schools, and law students trying to write papers for their journals. The Blum group is itching for a test case to broaden the score of anti-affirmative action outcomes. After targeting Morrison Foerster, the firm folded. The next to give up is Gibson Dunn. From [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/gibson-dunn-changes-diversity-award-criteria-as-firms-face-suits):

Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher changed the eligibility criteria for its diversity scholarships, becoming at least the second major law firm to take the step as rivals face lawsuits targeting similar programs.

The firm’s $50,000 diversity and inclusion scholarship goes to students “who have demonstrated resilience and excellence on their path toward a career in law,” under the new language, which is a change from “students who identify with an underrepresented group,” according to the archival Wayback Machine website.

The changed language, cookie cutter as it is, is still preferable to the libertarians “[thought diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/biglaw-caves-morrison-foerster-changes-diversity-fellowship-criteria-following-lawsuit/)” candidates the MoFo language change seems catered toward. Both quitters have chosen to use the word resilience in their lawsuit-evading language.

The Blum groups behind these suits might be dumb, but they’re not that dumb. It doesn’t take much peering between the lines to see that the word resilience is functioning as the new Black. It’s probably more accurate to say that resilience is the new white woman [as they’re the greatest beneficiaries of affirmative action programs](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/06/29/affirmative-action-who-benefits-white-women/70371219007/), but you see my point. The exact wording of these diversity initiatives doesn’t matter nearly as much as the outcomes. Either the programs will result in all white male cohorts which will [thwart all manner of meaningful connections and positions people of color can occupy down the line](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/georgias-southern-district-has-yet-to-have-a-black-judge-things-dont-look-better-after-getting-rid-of-affirmative-action/), or the admittance of any minority will still set off the pro-SFFA types who will threaten to sue – regardless of the applicant’s credentials. Trump nominated a slew of judges [that even the ABA wouldn’t co-sign](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/467345-senate-confirms-trump-judicial-pick-labeled-not-qualified-by-american-bar/) and a [little experienced](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/10/amy-coney-barrett-is-the-least-experienced-supreme-court-nominee-in-30-years/#:~:text=Barrett%20has%20never%20tried%20a,work%2C%20even%20during%20law%20school.) jurist [who couldn’t remember the First Amendment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfclKXPhILc) to fill Ginsburg’s seat while Biden’s judicial nominees have to be [the next Learned Hand](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/03/tucker-carlson-ketanji-brown-jackson) to be even worthy of consideration.

If there is going to be any teeth to them, some firm is going to have to step up and fight the disparate discrimination claim that these diversity scholarships will bring about. We know it won’t be MoFo or Gibson. Perkins Coie has promised to “vigorously” defend against such suits and I hope that they win. Because if it’s not them, it definitely won’t be Jones Day.

# Amended Gender Discrimination Case Brings The Real Scoop On Jones Day Compensation
## Gender discrimination case against Jones Day gets even bigger. (Yes, AGAIN.)

It may seem like we spend an inordinate amount of time piling on Jones Day; I mean, we’ve written eight stories (and counting) about allegations of gender bias at the firm. But the initial complaint was juicy, alleging a “fraternity culture” at the firm and unequal pay behind the firm’s notorious “[black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/)” compensation system, and so much has been happening in the case with more women being added as named plaintiffs and/or opting into the class action that we simply had to write more stories.

On Monday, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against the Biglaw giant. In addition to named plaintiffs Nilab Rahyar Tolton and Andrea Mazingo, who were identified in the earlier version of the complaint, three of the four anonymous Jane Doe plaintiffs have chosen to reveal themselves. Meredith Williams and Jaclyn Stahl were associates in the firm’s Irvine office, while Saira Draper worked for Jones Day in Atlanta. The decision to publicly identify themselves has been a fraught one, with[ Jones Day pushing](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/jones-day-wants-gender-discrimination-plaintiffs-to-reveal-themselves-to-the-public/) for the names of the plaintiffs to become public. In a [statement](https://sanfordheisler.com/statement-of-the-plaintiffs-tolton-et-al-v-jones-day/) about the complaint, the plaintiffs say they were bolstered by others coming forward:

“It is time to do away with the stigmatization of women who challenge discrimination and harassment in their workplaces. We will not stay silent; we will not be bullied. And we are empowered by our solidarity.”

One plaintiff, Jane Doe 4, has maintained her anonymity. In previous filings, plaintiffs analogized their position to that of a whistleblower.

Additionally, plaintiffs formally picked up former New York associate, [Katrina Henderson](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/jones-day-gender-discrimination-case-spreads-to-new-york/?rf=1), as a named plaintiff. Another woman, Jessica Jardine Wilkes, was the first non-named plaintiff to opt-in to the lawsuit earlier this month.

The amended complaint alleges the firm’s notorious “[black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/)” compensation system is used to pay women less than men at the firm. And,[ as reported](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/06/25/jones-day-bias-claims-spread-to-atlanta-new-york-as-more-accusers-go-public/) by Law.com, the amended complaint brings receipts:

The seven women now on the complaint also provided details of their salaries and bonuses during their time at the firm, illustrating that their pay did not compare with the Cravath scale. They said Jones Day’s “black box” system of compensation allows the firm to depart from its stated commitment to reward top performers with pay that matches market leaders.

So, just how much does compensation at Jones Day diverge from the Cravath scale? Well, the complaint provides helpful charts to show just how underpaid plaintiffs were at Jones Day.







 While all plaintiffs were paid below market all the years they were at the firm, you can see the issue gets more pronounced the more senior the associate. This isn’t surprising as the firm has historically enjoyed the ability to say it at least meets the market for first-year associates (never mind those pesky bonuses) in its recruitment efforts, and once the associate is ensconced in the firm, the salary crunch is on.

Regardless of what happens on the merits of the case, in publicly revealing their salary information, plaintiffs have dramatically increased the transparency of Jones Day. Something anyone considering working at the firm should be appreciative of.

# Biglaw Partner Gets Thrown Under The Bus By Her Firm
## This is a warning for other Biglaw partners eager to get on TV by spouting unsubstantiated talking points.

Remember Mercedes Colwin? The managing partner of Gordon & Rees’s New York office who’s a Fox News talking head went on Sean Hannity’s show last week to [tell the world that women who speak out about sexual harassment and assault are usually doing so for money](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/this-biglaw-partners-insulting-appearance-on-fox-news/?rf=1) and women who are victims of predators are “very few and far between.”

Yes, that really happened.

And when [Jordan Weissmann of Slate](https://slate.com/business/2017/11/mercedes-colwin-tells-hannity-women-lie-about-harassment-for-money.html) reached out for comment, she declined to walk back on her assertion that real victims were rare, but claimed to be “sympathetic” to them — whenever they exist.

Mercedes Colwin

Now Gordon & Rees has come forward with their statement from [Dion Cominos](https://www.gordonrees.com/lawyers/d/dion-n-cominos), firmwide managing partner, on the incident. To say they’re trying to distance themselves from one of their partners is an understatement. Here’s the key graph where they call out Colwin’s “very few and far between” claim as inaccurate, turning the phrase against her:

[T]he organization in no way endorses or agrees with any statements which could even remotely be interpreted as minimizing or trivializing the seriousness and gravity of sexual harassment or similarly predatory behaviors, and we renounce them in the strongest possible terms – in fact, contrary to what may have been inferred from what was said during the telecast, the sad reality is that the number of women who likely have not been exposed to such repugnant conduct over the course of their personal or professional lives is, unfortunately, few and far between.

Hope Colwin likes the view from under the bus.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Oh, and she is out of firm management:

The partner in question has voluntarily stepped down from all management roles within the firm and she is committed to rectifying the hurtful impressions created by her remarks.

Well, that’s a pretty strong statement. I’m sure there are some people who’d like to see Colwin removed from the firm entirely — and I feel you on that one — but removing a partner is a lot more complicated than some at-will employee. Cominos’s statement makes clear the firm’s priorities, and serves as a warning for any other Biglaw partners eager to get TV time by spouting unsubstantiated talking points.

Read the firm’s full statement below.

# 5 Diversity Action Items For Law Firms
## Diversifying the legal profession literally requires changing the face of your workforce.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://bit.ly/2KxFPa6) team of expert contributors. [Linda Maria Wayner](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/team/linda-maria-wayner/) is Senior Director of Diversity Initiatives, and she works with law firms and in-house legal departments looking to promote equity and inclusion within their organizations. Linda previously worked as a litigator at Skadden, then as Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s counsel for international affairs, and most recently as a diversity professional with several private and non-profit institutions. She is a graduate of the University of Michigan (JD) and Baylor University (BA and MA).

The perennial debate on diversity within the legal profession emerged again recently when over [170 general counsels signed an open ultimatum](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/01/27/170-gcs-pen-open-letter-to-law-firms-improve-on-diversity-or-lose-our-business/) to the Biglaw community:  show us statistical progress or prepare for extinction.  Law firms no longer have the luxury of asking why they should propel women, attorneys of color, and LGBTQ+ lawyers toward success.  It is presumed every sophisticated business leader has [read the research](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/gpsolo/publications/gp_solo/2012/september_october/diversity_practice_law_how_far_have_we_come/) and understands the underlying business rational and moral imperative.  As a former Biglaw associate, minority bar association leader, and diversity professional, I offer here five ideas for law firms that are sincerely ready to improve.  To preface, nothing here is particularly revolutionary. These are just a few common-sense tips to help move your firm beyond its demographic plateaus, and enhance your firm’s prospects for success.

1) Identify a specific diversity narrative.  Just about every law firm website includes boilerplate language about the organization’s commitment to diversity. Discerning candidates know to probe beyond marketing puffery.  What success has your organization enjoyed with women, attorneys of color, or the LGBT legal community? Perhaps your firm goes [above and beyond](https://www.workingmother.com/best-law-firms-for-women-2018) to support mothers on the partnership track.  Or, does your firm encourage associates to become affinity bar association leaders by granting billable credit for those activities?  A personalized narrative (with facts to back it up) tells a much more compelling story than generic platitudes. If, after deep searching, there is nothing unique about your firm’s diversity strategy, it may be time to consider whether your firm’s ideological commitment is translating into measurable positive impact.

2) Broaden your hiring specifications. If you take away anything from this article, let it be this: It is numerically impossible to improve diversity at law firms if hiring partners fail to consider strong candidates from a wide variety of law schools. The Law School Admissions Council [bluntly states](https://www.lsac.org/discover-law/diversity-law-school/raciallyethnically-diverse-applicants) that the current population of law school students across our country does not yet reflect societal demographics.  We also know that racial minorities are far more likely to incur [staggering law school debt](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/minority-lawyers-hanging-from-their-own-bootstraps-how-law-schools-fail-those-who-seek-justice_us_5b17f63ce4b00229eba3c6f3), so they quite reasonably consider financial aid just as important as a law school’s rank (if not more so).  If minority students are economically induced to attend second- and third-tier schools, and we know there are insufficient diverse law students nationwide to start with, law firms cannot bypass all but 14 schools and realistically improve diversity.  Recruiters who tell you otherwise are either inexperienced in the diversity space, or unwilling to break from antiquated habits.

3) Get serious about employee retention. Imagine a partner reading a client email that says, “I am considering alternative firms that will be more responsive to my particular needs.”  Most partners would immediately jump to address specific problems before that client goes elsewhere.  Now, instead of a client, picture a diverse midlevel associate articulating the identical statement to that same partner.  How many rainmakers and practice group leaders would go to the same lengths to keep that associate? If firms want to keep diverse associates as potential long-term leaders, they must treat them as important assets because that is what they are.  And remember, the savvy diverse candidates you are (or should be) courting will take a hard look at your firm’s midlevel and senior associate ranks as a predictor of their own prospects for success. Retention begets recruitment.

4) Call the bosses to action.  Law firm diversity efforts often fall disproportionately on the shoulders of diverse associates.   How many of your law firm partners (diverse and non-diverse) serve on the board of a national affinity bar association? Are any regularly investing their time (in addition to their checkbook) with the non-profits and law schools devoted to innovative diversity programming?  I know firsthand that groups such as the [Hispanic National Bar Association](https://hnba.com/), the [Institute for Legal Inclusion in the Legal Profession](http://www.theiilp.com/), and [Pipeline to Practice](https://pipelinetopractice.org/) (whose board I recently joined) all welcome sincere attention from law firm leaders.  Not only would such efforts broadcast a genuine interest in diversity within the profession, they have a decent shot at improving cultural competence among leaders within your organization.

5) Stop staring inward.  I would wager my last paycheck that after last month’s general counsel letter, law firms across the nation began convening internal Diversity Committee meetings to (1) identify which of their clients signed the letter; and (2) formulate a public relations response to anxiously highlight their own progress on the diversity front.  Don Prophete of Constangy, Brooks, Smith & Prophete decided to [publicly respond](https://www.law.com/2019/01/30/a-black-partner-responds-to-gcs-on-law-firm-diversity/), not on behalf of his firm, but to offer his own testimony as the first black lawyer to become a name partner at an Am Law 250 firm.  He instantly became the most credible voice on this topic by taking a risk and engaging candidly in the national conversation. Creating internal task forces and subcommittees will not yield this type of powerful impact. Diversifying the legal profession literally requires changing the face of your workforce, so looking beyond your firm for advice and expertise is essential.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It may not seem like a big thing, but we have to recognize that younger lawyers feel more connected through chats and text chains. We as teachers and mentors have to, in some ways, not just expect everyone to adapt to our style but also adapt to their style. So that is one challenge.

— Paul Schmidt, chair of BakerHostetler, [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2023/08/30/what-law-firms-can-do-to-upgrade-their-zoom-associates/) about some of the generational challenges facing Biglaw. He noted that using technology that associates are comfortable with is one way to bridge that gap.

Now, on to the news.

Lawyer Of The Week: New York State Senator Brad Hoylman

The obvious picks for LOTW honors would be the lawyers involved in the Trump impeachment trial — the [nine house managers](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/us/politics/house-impeachment-managers-.html), all lawyers; their outside advisors, including [Barry Berke and Joshua Matz](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/01/15/new-impeachment-same-lawyers-house-judiciary-rehires-barry-berke-joshua-matz-for-trumps-2nd-trial/); and Donald Trump’s [defense team](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/us/politics/trump-impeachment-lawyers.html), including [Bruce Castor and David Schoen](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/02/05/trumps-lawyers-are-sloppy-and-mediocre-so-what/). But you don’t read Judicial Notice to learn about the obvious.

So I’m going in a different direction and naming New York State Senator [Brad Hoylman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Hoylman), a Rhodes Scholar and Harvard Law School graduate, as Lawyer of the Week. Hoylman, Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, [just secured the repeal](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/nyregion/walking-while-trans-ban.html) of New York’s notorious “walking while trans” law — an overbroad anti-loitering statute that gave rise over the years to police abuse and harassment, especially of women of color, many of them transgender. Hoylman — a Democrat who represents the 27th District, and a [member of the LGBTQ community](https://twitter.com/bradhoylman/status/1008441619069140995) himself — was lead sponsor of the bill, which was sponsored by Amy Paulin in the Assembly.

As you might expect from a lawyer, Hoylman looks out for the legal profession as well. He’s also the lead sponsor of [Senate Bill S8682A](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s8682), which would create a form of diploma privilege in New York State, sparing thousands of law school graduates from having to take the bar exam in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic — an [increasingly popular option](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/08/18/the-test-is-being-prioritized-over-graduates-new-yorks-bar-plan-slammed-by-examinees-and-lawmakers/) given the challenges of administering a bar exam during a global public health crisis.

Good luck, Zachary!

Judge Of The Week: Judge Lynn Hughes

Judge [Lynn Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Hughes) (S.D. Tex.) strikes (out) again. As reported by [Alison Frankel](https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-otc-hughes/houston-judge-lynn-hughes-is-pulled-off-another-case-as-5th-circuit-revives-profs-discrimination-claim-idUSKBN2A13T3) of Reuters (via [Howard Bashman of How Appealing](https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/2021/02/01/#144632)), the frequently reversed Judge Hughes just got benchslapped yet again by the Fifth Circuit, this time in [Miller v. University of Houston](https://static.reuters.com/resources/media/editorial/20210201/millervsamhouston--5thcircuit.pdf). These tweets, by Raffi Melkonian and Orin Kerr, say it all:

You can read the full opinion [here](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/19/19-20753-CV0.pdf) (also via [Howard](https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/2021/01/29/#144359)). It’s a doozy.

Runners-up: Judge Juliet Howard and Judge Norma Jennings, both of New York City Housing Court. When Judge Howard takes the bench later this month, they will become the first married same-sex couple appointed to the same court in New York, [according to](https://www.law.com/2021/02/03/an-historic-moment-brooklyn-judge-set-to-join-her-wife-on-housing-court-bench/) the Richard C. Failla LGBTQ Commission of NY Courts. Matthew Skinner, executive director of the Commission, commented that the duo “really add something wonderful to the bench in New York City.” Congratulations, Your Honors!

Ruling Of The Week: Tsao v. Captiva MVP Restaurant Partners LLC

The Supreme Court issued some [interesting rulings](https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/2021/02/03/#144734) this past week. It gave California churches [partial relief from COVID-19 restrictions](https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/2021/02/06/#145028), ruled in favor of Germany in a [closely watched case over Nazi-era art](https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/2021/02/04/#144881), and held that [federal courts can review](https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/2021/02/03/#144842) an administrative board’s refusal to reopen a case denying disability benefits to a railroad worker. That third case, Salinas v. U.S. Railroad, was the first 5-4 ruling in an argued case this Term, and the line-up was interesting; Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh [joined the three liberal justices](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/02/03/roberts-and-kavanaugh-split-from-conservatives-in-terms-first-5-4-ruling/) to rule for the plaintiff.

But big-ticket rulings from SCOTUS are obvious. And, as noted, you don’t come here for the obvious.

So for Ruling of the Week, I’m actually going with the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in [Tsao v. Captiva MVP Restaurant Partners LLC](https://www.law.com/2021/02/05/11th-circuit-identity-theft-alone-is-not-enough-to-gain-standing-in-litigation/), which I’d file under “seemingly boring but actually important.” The case presented two questions. First, did plaintiff Tsao, patron of a fast-casual restaurant chain whose information was stolen in a data breach, have standing to sue because of exposure to the future risk of identity theft, absent any actual misuse of his information? Second, were Tsao’s efforts to mitigate the risk of future identity theft, such as canceling a compromised credit card (and losing out on reward points), a concrete injury sufficient to establish standing?

Judge Gerald Bard Tjoflat, writing on behalf of himself and Judge William B. Traxler (4th Cir.), answered no to both questions. Judge Adalberto Jordan concurred in the judgment, ending his concurrence by all but begging SCOTUS to get involved: “Hopefully the Supreme Court will soon grant certiorari in a case presenting the question of Article III standing in a data breach case.”

I believe that the Court will — and should — take such a case. As practicing litigators know, standing, which might seem dry and boring, is actually of critical importance. And as data breaches become increasingly common, the issue of who can sue over a breach and when will only grow in significance.

Litigation Of The Week: State Attorneys General Versus McKinsey

McKinsey & Company, the Cravath of management consulting, just announced a massive [$573 million settlement](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/business/mckinsey-opioids-settlement.html) with the attorneys general of 47 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories. The settlement resolves investigations into McKinsey’s role in helping its clients “[turbocharge](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/purdue-pharma-mckinsey-oxycontin-opiods.html)” their opioid sales, which fueled the opioid epidemic in the United States. The company also struck separate deals with Washington State, for $13 million, and West Virginia, for $10 million. (Nevada has not settled and continues to pursue its own opioid investigation.)

As noted by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/business/mckinsey-opioids-settlement.html), the settlement is striking because it’s rare to see McKinsey held accountable for its work on behalf of clients — clients who, McKinsey likes to stress, receive McKinsey advice but ultimately make their own decisions. The terms of the settlement are also noteworthy: although McKinsey admits no wrongdoing, which is standard for such deals, it agreed to abide by court-ordered restrictions on its work with certain addictive narcotics, to retain emails for five years, to disclose potential conflicts of interest when bidding for state contracts, and to put tens of thousands of pages of documents about its opioid work onto a publicly available database.

This settlement, while sizable and sweeping, does not represent the end of McKinsey’s legal woes. It doesn’t preclude local governments from suing the consulting giant, nor does it bind the federal government — so stay tuned to see whether the Biden administration takes action.

Speaking of the Biden administration, my first runner-up for Litigation of the Week is the Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Yale University, challenging the school’s affirmative action policy as discriminating against white and Asian-American applicants — a lawsuit the new administration [just dropped](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/us/yale-admissions-affirmative-action.html). Keep an eye out for similar shifts in government positions over the weeks and months ahead.

Second runner-up: election technology maker Smartmatic’s [$2.7 billion lawsuit](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/business/media/smartmatic-fox-news-lawsuit.html) against Fox News and three of its anchors, Maria Bartiromo, Jeanine Pirro, and Lou Dobbs (now a [former](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/business/lou-dobbs-fox.html) Fox anchor). The 276-page [complaint](https://www.smartmatic.com/uploads/Smartmatic_Complaint_Against_Fox_Corporation.pdf) was [filed on Smartmatic’s behalf](https://www.smartmatic.com/us/media/article/smartmatic-files-27-billion-defamation-lawsuit-against-fox-corporation/) by [J. Erik Connolly](https://www.beneschlaw.com/people/j-erik-connolly.html) of Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan & Aronoff LLP. (In case you’re wondering why Smartmatic filed in New York Supreme Court rather than in a federal court, it’s because Smartmatic and Fox News, both Delaware corporations, [lack diversity](https://www.smartmatic.com/us/media/article/faq-defamation-lawsuit-against-fox-corporation/).)

Deal Of The Week: Stone Point Capital And Insight Partners Buying CoreLogic

On Thursday, a pair of private equity firms, Stone Point Capital LLC and Insight Partners, announced their [purchase of real estate-data provider CoreLogic Inc.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/stone-point-capital-insight-partners-near-deal-to-buy-corelogic-11612447821) for $6 billion — a handsome 51 percent premium to CoreLogic’s share price last summer, which is when shareholder activists showed up on the scene and started [making noise](https://investor.cannaeholdings.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cannae-holdings-and-senator-investment-group-propose-nine).

Congratulations to the three law firms advising the principals: Skadden Arps for Corelogic, Kirkland & Ellis for Stone Point, and Willkie Farr for Insight. But note that the deal isn’t quite done yet. Rival bidder CoStar Group Inc., another player in the real estate-data space, is reviewing its options — which could include a new bid or a proxy fight. So more work for law firms might still be on the way.

Runner-up: Bayer AG’s [$2 billion settlement](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bayer-glyphosate-idUSKBN2A32MX) of future claims that its widely used weedkiller, Roundup, causes cancer. Settlements of litigations are, of course, deals — and sometimes the dollar amounts involved can dwarf those of M&A or capital markets transactions.

Law Firm Of The Week: Kaplan Hecker & Fink

This week, whenever there was some interesting legal matter in the news, lawyers from Kaplan Hecker & Fink — the elite New York boutique led by Robbie Kaplan, Sean Hecker, and Julie Fink — were there.

On Tuesday, the House impeachment managers delivered their [77-page brief](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/02/us/politics/impeachment-manager-brief.html) laying out their case against former President Donald Trump. Although former KHF partner Joshua Matz is mentioned only in the final footnote thanking him for his “invaluable assistance,” Matz — who, along with Professor Laurence Tribe, literally [wrote the book on impeachment](https://amzn.to/36O5jvL) — surely played a major role in this effort. (Matz is working on the impeachment trial in his personal capacity — just as he did when he worked on Trump’s first impeachment trial, he resigned from Kaplan Hecker & Fink before going to help out the House managers — but don’t be surprised if he returns to the firm yet again when this is all over.)

Also on Tuesday, Pornhub [issued a statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A6PHfBOIqCnHPoNyMHDfb0ahX7iJ_bU9/view) announcing what it described as “a series of industry-leading safety and security policies,” which it enacted in the wake of a scathing [New York Times expose](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html) alleging that the online porn purveyor essentially turned a blind eye to the proliferation of illegal content on its platform. The new policies and procedures reflect the results of KHF’s [independent review](https://knowtechie.com/pornhubs-new-trust-and-safety-policies-include-biometric-tech/) of Pornhub’s moderation procedures and other safety protocols. Some might find representing a porn platform to be distasteful — but like it or not, porn isn’t going away anytime soon, so it’s important to make sure that what’s out there is legal and consensually produced.

On Wednesday, Judge Norman Moon (W.D. Va.) [set an October 25 trial date](https://www.integrityfirstforamerica.org/newsroom/ifa-s-landmark-charlottesville-lawsuit-set-for-trial-this-october-holding-account) for Sines v. Kessler, the landmark litigation brought by KHF against the neo-Nazis and white supremacists responsible for the August 2017 [Charlottesville car attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville_car_attack) that killed Heather Heyer and injured 19 others. The lawsuit, first filed [back in 2017](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/10/two-new-lawsuits-against-the-organizers-of-charlottesvilles-unite-the-right-rally.html) by Robbie Kaplan and Karen Dunn (then of Boies Schiller Flexner), raises the interesting and important issue of where to draw the line between protected free speech and illegal incitement to violence.

When I [interviewed](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/a-history-making-litigator-leaves-biglaw-to-launch-a-boutique/) Robbie Kaplan back in 2017 about the launch of her new firm, she spoke about her desire “to fuse together a private commercial practice with a public interest practice for the mutual benefit of both.” Almost four years into the venture, it looks like she and her team are doing just that.

Lateral Move Of The Week: Biglaw Spawning Boutiques

We’re still in the first quarter, so not surprisingly, [lateral movement remains brisk](https://www.law.com/2021/02/05/hire-up-the-week-big-law-built-boutiques-broke-new-ground/). The intellectual property space was [especially active](https://www.law.com/2021/02/05/jenner-block-poaches-from-2-firms-to-start-itc-group-should-i-be-stayed-or-should-i-go-from-the-wd-texas-another-showdown-at-the-alsup-corral/). Jenner & Block hired three partners — Mark Davis and Ron Pabis from Goodwin Procter, and Alex Hadjis from Oblon, McClelland, Maier & Neustadt — to launch an International Trade Commission (ITC) practice group. And two former administrative patent judges of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) [found new gigs](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/02/04/former-pto-judges-find-new-roles-at-biotech-startup-ropes-gray/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_content=20210205&utm_campaign=skilledintheart&utm_term=law): Phil Hoffmann joined Ropes & Gray as a senior attorney, and Scott Kamholz left Covington & Burling, where he had been of counsel, to join Flagship Pioneering’s Tessera Therapeutics as vice president of intellectual property.

There were also a number of notable office openings, fueled by partner poaching. K&L Gates [launched in Nashville](https://www.reuters.com/article/kl-nashville/kl-gates-cannonballs-into-nashville-legal-market-with-27-lawyers-idUSL1N2K93GM#:~:text=K%26L%20Gates%20cannonballs%20into%20Nashville%20legal%20market%20with%2027%20lawyers,-By%20David%20Thomas&text=K%26L%20Gates%20is%20looking%20to,poached%20from%20four%20different%20firms.), after hiring 27 attorneys from area firms Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, Butler Snow, Dickinson Wright, and Bass, Berry & Sims; Quinn Emanuel [launched in Atlanta](https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2021/02/01/quinn-emanuel-launches-in-atlanta-its-second-new-city-this-year/#:~:text=Just%20weeks%20after%20launching%20in,foothold%E2%80%9D%20in%20the%20coming%20years.), after hiring antitrust partner Debra Bernstein from Alston & Bird; and Holland & Knight [launched in Orange County](https://www.hklaw.com/en/news/pressreleases/2021/02/holland-knight-opens-orange-county-office#:~:text=IRVINE%2C%20Calif.,and%20founding%20shareholder%20of%20ECG.), California, after hiring seven litigators previously with the Enterprise Counsel Group.

But I think the biggest moves of the week were three groups breaking away from Biglaw to launch boutiques. This continues what I see as a decade-long trend of partners leaving large firms in search of more autonomy, more collegiality, fewer conflicts, less overhead, and — at least in some cases — more money. Specifically:

- Eight partners, including international arbitration practice founder and head Emmanuel Gaillard, [left Shearman & Sterling](https://www.law.com/2021/02/05/hire-up-the-week-big-law-built-boutiques-broke-new-ground/) to form Gaillard Banifatemi Shelbaya Disputes. The new firm, which will have offices in Paris, London, and New York, will reportedly take with it some $30 million to $40 million in revenue, as well as 30 or so associates. (They seem to be leaving on good terms; Shearman even [issued a press release](https://www.shearman.com/news-and-events/news/2021/02/announcement-regarding-the-establishment-of-a-new-international-arbitration-firm) about the departures.)
- Seven partners — Andrew Glenn, Lyn Agre, Jed Bergman, Trevor Welch, Olga Fuentes, Michael Bowen, and Marissa Miller — [left Kasowitz Benson](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/02/02/7-kasowitz-partners-spin-off-to-new-boutique-subleasing-2-boies-schiller-offices/) to form [Glenn Agre Bergman & Fuentes](https://glennagre.com/). The new firm is subletting space from Boies Schiller Flexner in New York and San Francisco, and Glenn Agre and Boies Schiller plan to work on cases together as well. (Name partner Olga Fuentes is married to Boies Schiller partner Peter Skinner.)
- Former Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller [left Baker Botts](https://www.law.com/2021/02/02/baker-botts-supreme-court-practice-head-leaves-to-start-boutique-firm/?kw=Baker%20Botts%27%20Supreme%20Court%20Practice%20Head%20Leaves%20to%20Start%20Boutique%20Firm&utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_campaign=litdailymorningupdate&utm_content=20210204&utm_term=tal), where he served as head of the firm’s Supreme Court practice, to form [Lehotsky Keller](https://www.lehotskykeller.com/) with Steven Lehotsky, who left his role as chief litigation counsel at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Both former Supreme Court clerks (Keller for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and Lehotsky for Justice Antonin Scalia), they will focus on complex litigation, including practice before the Supreme Court and challenges to federal and state laws and regulations.
Congratulations to these three exciting new firms. Several developments over the past decade or so, including improvements in ediscovery technology and the rise of vendors and alternative legal service providers who focus on large-scale discovery, have made high-end litigation much easier to handle without all the bodies of Biglaw. You just need the brainpower — which is why I’m betting on boutiques as the future of high-end, cutting-edge litigation.

# Am Law 200 Firm's Austerity Measures Include The Dreaded Layoffs
## More bad news from the Biglaw trenches.

Another day, more COVID-19 austerity measures.

The latest firm Above the Law can report is making cost-cutting moves amid the global pandemic is Vedder Price. The firm made $257,000,000 in 2018 gross revenue making it [121st on the Am Law 200](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=312&name=Vedder-Price), but as we’ve seen time and again, a history of high revenue numbers doesn’t stop the new coronavirus reality.

According to tipsters, the firm made a 4 percent reduction of force, and attorneys, staff, and paralegals all found themselves out of work. Partners also took a 20 percent cut on their draws, the summer program has been shortened, and the new associate class slated to start at the firm in the fall has been pushed back until January 2021.

When reached for comment, a spokesperson provided the following:

Vedder Price has taken measures in response to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. We reduced our workforce by 4% in areas where utilization was most impacted by the remote work environment, and provided each affected person with severance plus healthcare coverage through September. The Firm’s shareholders/owners also proactively reduced their current pay by 20% to bear the financial brunt of the crisis. Finally, we shortened the duration of our 2020 summer program and deferred the start date of our incoming 2020 first year associate class to January 2021.

Best of luck to those laid off during these tough times.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Biglaw Firm Tells Associates They Can Afford To Raise Salaries... But They're Still Not Going To

Back in 2016, Fish & Richardson [raised salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/boston-based-law-firm-raises-salaries-for-all-offices/) across its offices to match the $180K scale, making its silence during the current wave of raises all the more deafening. Early on in this cycle, we noted that any firm that raised in 2016 and didn’t offer this raise — which amounts to basically a cost-of-living adjustment — would signal to the entire market that they felt they [overreached in trying to play with the elite firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-the-milbank-raise-is-not-that-big-of-a-deal-and-why-it-is/).

Today, Fish & Richardson declared that it is comfortable sliding into that niche of sub-elite firms. That’s not necessarily a mark of shame… some clients need a firm below Cravath-level. But it does force a recalibration among associates and law students considering where they want to work this year and beyond.

For its part, Fish & Richardson announced the news via a business hours email — a format that [should be reserved for full matches](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/new-global-law-firm-touts-itself-as-big-player-gives-out-paltry-raises-anyway/) — and, hooboy, what an email it was!

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
After informing associates that, no, they would not be seeing any change to their compensation, the firm decided they had to actively brag about how much money they’re making. It’s the mentality of an adolescent getting publicly dumped and telling everyone they know about how much sex they’ve been having with a girl you don’t know from another school:

Fish has maintained its associate salary scale at the top of the market for many years, responding to and matching each scale increase. As is the case with all firms, doing so has involved assessing the financial impact, electing to match, and then absorbing the impact…. We have never been stronger than we are today, by every measure – we have strong and well managed finances, no long term debt, recent historically robust economic performance, and a very busy and promising 2018 and beyond, with an enviable and enormously valuable brand, clientele, and market position, and the best legal talent in our practice areas.

“These are the Glengarry leads. And to you they’re gold, and you don’t get them.” Some may think this was a tasteless move for a top 50 PPP firm to write in a compensation email, but you’ve got to respect their commitment. If they’re going to functionally tell their associates to look elsewhere, might as well put an exclamation point on it.

For their part, management did offer some justifications for their decision.

1. Billable hours expectations. Our business is built on a 1900 billable hour expectation for our associates and principals. This is important to us and we don’t want it to change. We build our annual budgets and measure our expectations and success based on this organizing principle of our firm economics. We value the very strong work ethic of our associates and principals, and we celebrate and reward it (see below), but our budgets, compensation and bonus systems, and our culture are based on a true 1900 hour expectation…. With a 1900 billable hour expectation, we can do these things while leaving time for a fulfilling life outside of work.

One of the very best reasons to not raise associate salaries is maintaining a lower billable hour target. Unfortunately, multiple tipsters say that’s not what happened here:

- One final thing about our bonus system – the firm likes to brag about our 1900 hour requirement but if any associate actually works only 1900 hours we don’t get paid anywhere close to “market.” To receive a market bonus the firm requires we bill 2100 hours. So now we have to bill 2100 hours to receive a bonus commensurate with market bonus, and our salary is still lower.
- Specifically, the firm does not have a true 1900 billable hour expectation in the way that actual top-tier firms do.  In other words, you absolutely do not get market (Cravath) bonuses at the 1900 mark.  To get market bonuses in line with “peer” firms (though it’s fair to say that Fish cannot fairly claim to be a top tier firm anymore), you have to bill at least 2100 hours.  Even if you fall just a few hours short of 2100, they will dock at least 50-60% of the market bonus.  Recruits should know this.
UPDATE: But in fairness, one tipster wrote acknowledging that the firm does use a black box for bonuses but that they know of another associate who got market bonuses despite not exceeding 1900 hours most years. So there are a plethora of takes here.

The reasoning doesn’t get much better.

2. “One firm” culture. A guiding principle of the firm’s growth from one small office in Boston into a national IP powerhouse with eleven offices from coast to coast and a Munich office (along with our upcoming expansion into China) is that Fish is one firm. This means, among other things, that we have a single associate salary scale across all of our US offices, rather than one that varies by geography or practice group. Continuing to follow the herd by matching scale increases would put a great deal of pressure on our system, to the detriment of this positive and valuable aspect of our culture.

That’s stupid. Most of the firms matching this scale are doing it in all of their offices, which is also stupid. There’s no need to pay an attorney in some mid-tier market the same as an attorney in a major market. It’s not a commentary on “how hard” they work, it’s a factor of the marginal value of associates to the firm in different offices and a cost of living assessment that an attorney in bumblef**k at 80 percent salary is living a life equivalent to a New York associate. A decade ago, that wasn’t a controversial statement. It shouldn’t be again. #MakeAmericaUnderstandGeographicalRealitiesAgain.

3. Principalship track. We are not an “up or out” firm. We invest in the careers and development of our associates, and we hire associates we genuinely believe can progress to principalship. This works for us, as evidenced by the quality and retention of our outstanding group of principals. We see a relationship between our investment in our people, our commitment to provide meaningful opportunities early, the culture around our 1900 billable hour expectation, and our intent for our associates to progress to principalship.

First of all, see above about that 1900 hour requirement. Second, as one tipster held a dim view of the training culture, saying that “most of the principals eschew their responsibility to train new associates, and will instead attempt to poach associates trained by principals who actually care.”

4. Bonus system.

Yeah, this one was entirely a non-starter for the tipsters, pointing out that Fish basically requires elite hours to get a market bonus. Meaning the firm is functionally admitting that they aren’t matching base salaries so they can continue to match bonuses. In other words… they can’t match actual compensation.

5. Our clients. Our clients, their success, and our role in serving them successfully as their partners are the foundation of our business. Many things are changing and evolving in our industry, but there is none more important than the fact that our clients are ever more focused on the value they are receiving from their law firms.

Evidently, Fish is depending on clients to balk at hiring the Biglaw elite firms.

They are probably going to be waiting for a while.

Imagine you’re a law firm partner. You’ve got amazing colleagues, a solid work-life balance, and make great money. But you’ve always felt like something was missing. Because while practicing law is fine, it doesn’t feel like that’s what you were meant to do.

At the same time, you know you’ve got a pretty good deal. I mean, you’re a freaking law firm partner. So you ignore those thoughts about possibly doing something else. Right?

Well, not if you’re Karen Vladeck.

Today, Karen is a [managing director at Whistler Partners](https://www.whistlerpartners.com/team/karen-vladeck), a legal recruiting firm. To the surprise of exactly no one, she’s been absolutely crushing it ever since she left her law firm partnership. That’s because Karen has tapped into her unique superpower — the thing she’s always felt that she was meant to do.

“I’ve always been a connector,” she said. “Always had lots of friends, and built lots of relationships. And while I loved being a partner, it just wasn’t the highest and best use of my skills. I wanted to focus on the business side of the law 100% of the time.”

Karen’s knack with people is obvious to everyone who’s ever known her. For years, she would help lots of people land jobs at great firms, just through her network. Friends suggested that she consider a career in recruiting. “You should be paid for this,” they said. “Just think about how many people you’ve already placed!”

Recruiting did seem like a great fit. She’d be able to focus on what she enjoyed most — connecting with people, which she has always stressed should not feel like an awkward, forced occurrence. “I don’t really consider ‘networking’ to be part of business development and maybe that’s why I have never shied away from it,” Karen explained. “I consider ‘networking’ being out in the world and making friends.”

At some point, Karen realized that she was more interested in the business of building relationships between and among lawyers and clients than she was in the actual practice of law itself, which is when she decided to make the jump.

I asked Karen what it was like to walk away from the partnership. I remembered what it was like for me to leave the practice of law years ago. But I mean, [the circumstances were different](https://itsofftherecord.substack.com/p/how-i-found-my-first-legal-tech-job). I wasn’t a partner who was doing well. I wondered what pivoting felt like for someone who was thriving at her law job.

“Ever since I was in college, I wanted to be a lawyer,” Karen said. “Was I really going to take a job that anyone could do without a law degree? So much of my identity since I was 22 had been tied up in being a lawyer. Losing that part of my identity felt extremely scary.”

That’s the toughest part about doing something different. Because for many of us, the upside of finding something better always seems to be outweighed by the risk of walking away from something that’s so wrapped up in our identity. It feels like we’re giving up part of who we are. But at the same time, taking that risk could lead to something even better.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
For Karen, the biggest change is that she gets to focus 100% on building relationships. She can spend all her time on what she loves doing the most. Plus, one unexpected benefit is that now that she’s no longer a law firm partner, she has even more freedom to post whatever she wants on social media.

That’s partly because her new boss — [Sean Burke](https://www.whistlerpartners.com/team/sean-burke), the outspoken founder of Whistler Partners who once [bragged on LinkedIn about beating me in a game of one-on-one ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seanburkewp_hoopdreams-whitemancantjump-whistlerpartners-activity-6891948089222258688-06ne?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web)— is a fervent believer in the power of social media. “When I met Sean, I realized he was even more out there than I am, the stuff he posts on LinkedIn and just how he presents his genuine self at all times,” Karen recounted. “I felt like this was someone who was going to change the course of my life, and his energy and passion for this field got me very excited.”

Karen’s social media activity has been an incredible force multiplier on her ability to build relationships. She now has over 30,000 followers across [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ksvesq) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-shafrir-vladeck-b3b4973a/). She co-hosts a podcast about parenting and lawyering called [In Loco Parent(i)s](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/in-loco-parent-i-s/id1544196195), with her law professor husband [Steve Vladeck](https://twitter.com/steve_vladeck). She’s even made a series of TikToks (see [here](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTdoAfppA/?k=1), [here](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTdoASLgh/?k=1), [here](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTdoAamYV/?k=1), and [here](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTdoAfQEk/?k=1)) collabs with me, which have received over 4 million views.

The impact of all this online content can’t be overstated. In her first three months, Karen has placed as many candidates as most recruiters place over the course of an entire year. She’s now on track to earn far more than she ever did as a law firm partner. Which is incredibly inspiring because many of us believe that “doing work you’re meant to do” involves financial sacrifice.

But all this is more than just about money. Karen told me she wants to change the reputation of slimy legal recruiters who just want to move a candidate at all costs. Her goal is to genuinely help people in their careers and lives by helping connect them with the position that is right for them.

I asked if Karen had any advice for others who might be looking for their breakout role. How do you know if the opportunity in front of you is the right one?

“It’s not like someone’s going to hit you over the head and tell you that ‘this is a moment that’s gonna change your life,’” she explained. “It’s never going to be that obvious. It’s more subtle than that. Even now, when I talk to candidates for recruiting, they’re not happy where they are — but they don’t even want to take a meeting. I see my role as a good recruiter to meet people where they are in their job search journey but to also encourage candidates that they need to always be open to new opportunities in order to better their careers.”

To me, that’s the most important part of the story. You’ve got to keep an open mind. Yes, Karen experienced a lot of success in a traditional legal career through her unique combination of her intelligence, work ethic, and personality. But even so, her talents were not fully utilized in that kind of environment. So she kept an open mind.

You could probably imagine what someone might have said to Karen while she was considering the pivot. “Other people would kill to be where you are right now. Why on earth would you walk away from the partnership? Are you really going to throw it all away to just be a recruiter?”

Now I know it’s still early. We don’t know what will happen with Karen’s recruiting career, and a lot can change in the next few years. But here’s my take: Even if recruiting *doesn’t* work out — Karen’s not going to walk away empty-handed. She’s already made good money and grown her network significantly. She also has a deep understanding of how her natural talent can be combined with social media to generate a huge impact in the real world. That’s no small thing.

And if this recruiting thing does end up working out?

The sky’s the limit.

In the end, that’s what I wish for all of you. To keep an open mind about doing something different. Maybe you’re not unhappy at your job, and maybe you’re just curious about whether there’s something better out there. If that’s the case, I hope you remember Karen’s story. I want you to remember at least one example of how walking away from something that feels comfortable and safe might lead to something extraordinary.

So keep an open mind. You never know what could happen.

# Blue Cross Blue Shield Plans To Settle For $2.7B... And That's Not The Most Important Relief

With 2020 unleashing horrible twists and turns upon America every day, it’s de rigueur to expect the unexpected. A worldwide pandemic? Raging wild fires? Locusts? [Sure, why the hell not](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/06/14/876002404/locusts-are-a-plague-of-biblical-scope-in-2020-why-and-what-are-they-exactly)? But amidst all the bad news, 2020 has apparently brought us an unexpected return worth welcoming. [Blue Cross Blue Shield has agreed to a $2.7 billion settlement](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blue-health-insurers-reach-tentative-antitrust-settlement-for-2-7-billion-11600967231) that will, more importantly, bring injunctive relief that should trigger big changes to the health insurance market around the country. It’s 2020 and the Sherman Antitrust Act lives!

Technically the Act never went away, but surveying the landscape of American business one would be hard pressed to know it. Whether it’s a function of apathy or complicity, the government doesn’t bring antitrust cases with anywhere near the frequency that John Sherman would’ve envisioned.

And that’s a problem since mounting a viable private antitrust action is a mammoth undertaking. It’s a brutal, document intensive uphill slog. Once in a while a private action will pique the interest of the government who can come in and perform some heavy lifting, but if the government is going to look the other way it’s immensely difficult to keep a case going. Thankfully, some folks are willing to go out there and invest the time and effort to get the ball rolling.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

The last big ticket antitrust case most of us can remember was the Microsoft case in the late-90s. So it brings us full circle to find David Boies, who prosecuted the Microsoft case as hired counsel for the government, at the heart of the BCBS case as well.

Over 30 defendants, some 50 firms, and over 1000 lawyers got into this. David Boies recounts that the first mediation on the settlement agreement required finding a room big enough to fit 100 lawyers and capable of providing everyone a microphone. He told me that some meetings in hotel ballrooms required abandoning the big table and placing all the lawyers in rows like a standard seminar. It’s been a wild seven years for this case.

“It was like a soap opera,” I said. “It was! It was,” Boies replied. “But also very high stakes. The amount of money is obviously substantial — and probably what the headlines will focus on — but the injunctive relief was even more important…. If we’d only gotten the money it would’ve been historic — one of largest antitrust awards and probably the largest without government involvement — but it would not have made nearly as much difference for our clients.”

The lawsuit began over seven years ago when Boies Schiller brought claims on behalf of insureds arguing that BCBS acted as a cartel in requiring insurance carriers within its network to agree to geographic non-compete clauses and cap the share of revenue they can make from selling non-BCBS products. In a nutshell, BSBS said one of its member carriers would act as, say, “BCBS of Alabama” and no other BCBS carrier was allowed to compete for businesses headquartered in Alabama. And there’s a certain logic to that from a trademark perspective, but the plaintiffs noted that the insurance agreements went further to say that a BCBS member from outside the jurisdiction couldn’t enter the Alabama market even to sell non-BCBS plans. The proposition was basically “if you want to sell the BCBS brand anywhere, you have to agree to never enter the market of any other BCBS brand… oh and on top of all that you can’t have more than a third of your revenue from other brands.”

The implications of something like this should be obvious. The market power of BCBS — which provides health insurance to almost a third of the country — would convince players to steer clear of competing in defined markets for fear of losing BCBS plans in their own territories and consequently driving up prices for consumers. When Boies first brought the case, BCBS responded by noting that they’ve been doing this for 30 years and the DOJ has never complained, deploying the classic “it can’t be illegal if I’ve never been caught” defense. But, as Boies said, “that’s not a legal defense, but it’s a powerful atmospheric: ‘If experts from the Justice Department didn’t bring this, then why would you believe these plaintiffs?'” It’s a mindset that makes pursuing these cases that much harder, especially for private actors, but the stakes in the health insurance market are too high to keep letting it slide. “This shouldn’t have been left to us to do. The government should have done this,” Boies said.

For whatever reason, the government didn’t. One reason might be the fact that the BCBS system covers many underserved communities around the country, allowing them to claim that their business model is necessary to provide health care to many. “We said, ‘we’re not trying to break you up, we’re just saying you can’t use this as excuse not to compete,'” Boies told me. BCBS is made up of a number of separate companies forming a network to provide a unified product. “That’s obviously a good thing. But they said they wouldn’t compete with even different trademarks. In our view, that’s a per se unlawful restraint.” It’s also an argument that doesn’t make much sense. If competing in that area with a non-BCBS product wasn’t profitable then they wouldn’t compete there and nothing would change.

Even assuming the settlement is approved by all the defendant member companies and Judge David Proctor — who you may remember [scolded the parties to the case via GIF](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/federal-judge-vents-frustration-in-gif-form/) in one of this saga’s lighter moments — the case goes on for BCBS. The Boies clients were the insureds arguing that the BCBS model artificially drove up prices, but the other half of the consolidated case came from health providers arguing that the model allowed BCBS to exert improperly inflated leverage in negotiations with providers. It made for a weird marriage at times with both groups working in concert to prove the existence of antitrust behavior, while fundamentally conflicting on the recovery. After all, the existence of a national BCBS product created by the network actually helps the insureds keep premiums down. Basically one side said the behavior kept prices too high and the other said it kept them too low — an unusual spot for cooperating counsel to find themselves in. The provider claims are ongoing.

Working on one case for over seven years can be a serious grind. We overuse the Bleak House reference sometimes but when you’re in a room discussing settlement with over 100 attorneys it’s hard not to jump to the Dickens classic. But for the insureds represented by Boies Schiller, this case may soon be over and the impact that the injunctive relief will have on the health insurance market should be monumental.

# Former Biglaw Associate Accused Of Being 'Serial Bank Robber'
## He allegedly robbed -- or tried to rob -- five banks.

Typically, when someone says “you got robbed” when referring to a lawyer, they’re talking about a case that went poorly or a huge bill. After a series of bank robberies in South Florida, one former Biglaw associate is allegedly bringing a whole new meaning to the phrase.

Earlier this week, the FBI arrested [Aaron Honaker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-honaker-a23a7310/), 41, on suspicion of robbing, and attempting to rob, five banks. Honaker’s alleged crimes happened between September 30 and October 15 at four banks in Coral Gables (Citibank, Wells Fargo, Chase Bank, and HSBC Bank) and one bank in Aventura (Chase Bank).

Is this guy trying to become the next [Shon Hopwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shon_Hopwood)?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In interviews with [Local 10 News](https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/10/21/man-41-faces-charges-for-several-bank-robberies-in-miami-dade/), Honaker’s colleagues described him as a “highly intelligent” and “brilliant” attorney. “I have no explanation as to how he got to this point,” a former colleague said.

Honaker claims to be a graduate of Duke University and Duke Law on his LinkedIn profile, but the elite school says it has no record of him ever attending. Instead, it seems that he’s a graduate of Wake Forest University and [Wake Forest Law](https://alumnius.net/wake_forest_universi-8805-27#id38471931). Honaker began his legal career as an associate at Greenberg Traurig, where he practiced business reorganization and financial restructuring. According to the FBI, he’s now allegedly involved in a different kind of financial restructuring.

The [Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article246607993.html) has the details on Honaker’s alleged robbery attempts:


Aaron Honaker (Image via Miami-Dade Corrections)

▪ Sept. 30 — Citibank, 396 Alhambra Circle, Coral Gables.

The criminal complaint says Honaker, described as a 6-foot white male in his 30s, sat in the lobby for 15 minutes. He eventually handed a handwritten note to a teller warning against touching the alarm or calling the police while he asked for $10,000.

The teller said she told him she “didn’t have the money; it is in the machine.” Honaker left the bank with only his note.

▪ Oct. 3 — Chase, 20880 Biscayne Blvd., Aventura.

The complaint says Honaker told the teller he wanted to make a withdrawal, but lacked his debit card. He said, however, this note he was handing her would have instructions on how to help him withdraw cash. This time, the note requested all the $50 bills and $100 bills in the teller’s drawer be put in an envelope.

The teller did as asked. Honaker left with his note and $1,050.

▪ Oct. 5 — Wells Fargo, 2555 Ponce De Leon Blvd., Coral Gables.

This time, the complaint says, Honaker donned “a floppy hat and a blue, short-sleeved shirt” but kept a similar note. This one said, “Keep calm and give me all the money in the drawer. I have a gun.”

The teller feigned trouble with English, giving her an excuse to talk with her manager. While she informed her manager that the guy in the floppy hat was trying to rob them, Honaker backed away, appeared to get on his phone, then left the bank.

▪ Oct. 10 — Chase, 355 Alhambra Circle, Coral Gables.

The complaint says Honaker went back to asking for “$50s and $100s.” And he walked out with $800.

▪ Thursday, Oct. 15 — HSBC, 2222 Ponce De Leon Blvd., Coral Gables.

This time, the complaint says, Honaker’s note confused the teller.

The teller “glanced at the note and, without realizing its true meaning, asked (Honaker) to fill out a withdrawal slip first because she needed an account number.”

So, Honaker did. On the withdrawal slip, he wrote, “read the note.” The note asked for all $100s, $50s and $20s.

The teller told Honaker, the complaint said, “The bank kept its cash in counting machines” so she couldn’t give him what he wanted.

He left.

Honaker’s Florida Bar says he’s a senior associate at Martinez Morales, a business and real estate litigation firm. Per the [Daily Business Review](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2020/10/21/fbi-arrests-ex-big-law-attorney-over-florida-bank-robberies), partner Raul Morales says Honaker hasn’t worked at the firm for at least two years. “He disappeared. He was one day here, one day gone. I had no idea where he went,” Morales said.

Honaker is represented by a federal public defender and had his first court appearance on Wednesday. He currently remains in custody, and his bond hearing is scheduled for Friday.

# Big Law Boiz Brings The Hilarious Memes All Lawyers Need On Instagram
## It's not billable, but every lawyer needs to laugh.

‘Big Law Boiz, so hot right now. Big Law Boiz.’

Thanks to the pandemic, Biglaw associates across the country are stuck at home, billing their lives away, minute by minute, hour by hour. The monotony is enough to drive lawyers completely insane, but thankfully, an Instagram account exists whose creator feels your pain. You see, he’s a Biglaw associate too, and he understands just how badly his colleagues need to be entertained.

Meet [BigLawBoiz](https://www.instagram.com/biglawboiz/) (BLB). He’s a midlevel litigation associate in New York, and he’s keeping himself anonymous because Biglaw firms don’t take too kindly to being openly mocked by their employees. BLB says being anonymous is part of the fun of running the account. “It lends some credence to the fact that we’re all in this together,” he told me in a direct message. “We generally all feel and think in a somewhat similar way, and BLB could be you, could be me. It’s just someone there to give you a laugh and some perspective.”

(For what it’s worth, BLB isn’t the only Biglaw attorney who’s gotten into the IG meme game. Check out [@nonequitypartner](https://www.instagram.com/nonequitypartner/) for some corporate law comedy.)

BLB has 89.6K adoring followers, and his memes are pure gold. Take this, for example, from the day of the insurrection at the Capitol.


The fall of democracy is compelling and all, but my boss said he needed this right away. ([BigLawBoiz / Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJuED7CAUb04Q4tvbMkjn2_YW9OoUqZ6JhHlzw0/))

I recently got to chat with BLB. Here’s a write-up of our conversation.

SZ: Why did you decide to start this account?

BLB: When I was a junior associate, I didn’t feel like I had the ability to be terribly creative in my work. A lot of being a junior associate in Biglaw is doing what you are told (going above and beyond, of course) and coloring within the lines. I needed to flex some creative muscles, and I always considered myself a “funny” person. This was a good way to do that. I don’t know if I have the ability to be a story-teller like a stand-up comedian, but I am certainly situationally funny, and memes were the perfect avenue for that. I’ve tried some longer format writing and comedy in my blog. Whether people like it or not I don’t know, but I really enjoy the process. And I crack myself up.

SZ: How many hours a day do you dedicate to memes?

BLB: It’s hard to really put a specific amount of time to it. Ideas just pop into my head. Sometimes it’s the format that inspires the meme, or the joke that I find a format for. If I try too hard to come up with something funny, then it usually ends up as a flop. The proper process is quite natural, and truly beautiful. Some people dream in sound, I dream in memes (literally, sometimes).

SZ: What’s it like to have a cult following as an anonymous Instagram persona?

BLB: It was really strange at first. People always wanted to know who I was, or if I would do a face reveal. At first the anonymity was 100% about protecting my identity from public ridicule. As I started to realize it really wouldn’t matter at all who I was, the anonymity became more fun. I’m like your friendly neighborhood troll. I could be anyone, the guy two desks down, you, me. It doesn’t matter. Just someone here to make you laugh.

Although, it is fun when someone sends me or shows me one of my own memes. “This guy is hilarious!!!!” I’m certain I have made a meme about that.

SZ: Can people submit things to you that they think are worthy of being posted on your account?

BLB: I take submissions all the time. Sometimes it’s humor related, but more often it’s a cool picture (a pls fix), or some piece of news, or someone asking for advice and I pose it to the following. It’s definitely a community. Some have definitely started to figure out what makes me laugh, and that will get a re-post for sure. Sometimes the joke is just for me and my other meme account friends.

Here are some of BLB’s greatest hits. Don’t tell me you don’t feel seen.

# The Elite Law Schools Whose Graduates Contribute The Most To Climate Change
## If there's a ranking that a law school doesn't want to come out on top in, it's this one.

Students who graduate from our nation’s top law schools are too often faced with a choice between morality and prestige when making decisions about their career paths. When the best law schools facilitate a job search that feeds into the “Biglaw or bust” mentality, success is measured by the number of graduates who have secured positions at firms that may represent clients that represent the worst of the worst when it comes to our planet’s ongoing climate crisis.

A new report from Law Students for Climate Accountability set out to answer a simple question: which top 20 law schools, as ranked by U.S. News, have produced the most fossil fuel lawyers?

Before we get to that, we’ll remind our readers that the LSCA’s latest [Law Firm Climate Change Scorecard](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f53fa556b708446acb4dcb5/t/62ebf932b8d98868c9d2a882/1659631928519/2022+LSCA+Law+Firm+Climate+Scorecard.pdf) showed that major corporate law firms are a “hotbed of fossil fuel activity.” Here’s a breakdown of what that means: per LSCA, Vault 100 firms conducted 420 representations in cases exacerbating climate change, facilitated $1.62 trillion of fossil fuel transactions, and received $36.6 million in compensation for fossil fuel lobbying between 2017 and 2021. It’s worth noting here that each T-20 law school sends more than 41% of its graduates to Vault 100 firms, and many of those graduates go on to exacerbate the climate crisis through their legal work.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Thanks to LSCA’s “Fueling the Climate Crisis” report, the following facts have been revealed about the top 20 law schools:

- T-20 schools have produced fossil fuel lawyers at over three times the rate of the average U.S. law school.
- Nearly half of U.S. fossil fuel lawyers attended a T-20 law school.
It’s time for law schools to get with the times and do more to stop propelling students into careers where they may be doing more harm than good.

“Legal education—and particularly ‘elite’ law schools—have been captured by corporate interests that profit from, among other things, rendering the planet uninhabitable,” says Jon Hanson, the Alan A. Stone Professor of Law and the Director of the Systemic Justice Project at Harvard Law School. “The time is long overdue for those law schools and their BigLaw benefactors to be judged not according to their lofty justice claims or their astronomical wealth but according to their actual consequences here on Earth.”

# Back In The Race: Will The $180K Biglaw Starting Salaries Attract A New Group Of Law School Lemmings?

The media is continuing to cover the [Biglaw salary increases](http://bit.ly/2016salaryincreasePromo). They will continue to do so for some time as other firms play “me too” and commentators [discuss its impact](http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000523896) on the future of law and legal employment.

And you know who else has been reading this continuous coverage? Law school applicants.

[Cravath’s salary announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) was made on the day of the June LSAT examination. June is a crucial month for many law school applicants. They are thinking about which law school to attend or even whether they should attend at all. But there is not much time left to negotiate down tuition or to explore other options as they will soon have to pay tuition deposits, finalize financial aid, and set up housing arrangements on or near campus. Those who are on the fence about attending might decide to go based on this news.

If left unchecked, law school applications will likely rise in the future. While some applicants will have solid GPAs and LSAT scores, many will have marginal credentials and will likely attend low-ranked law schools with no discounts. Their chances of getting hired at a major law firm will be slim to none, which means they will have to struggle with student loan payments for the rest of their lives.

I understand that some of people with mediocre grades make up for it with passion and a track record of overcoming adversity. They spent most of their lives trying to prove themselves to everyone.

Some might think that the salary increases are a sign that the legal job market is improving. They think that if the large law firms are doing it, then midsize and small firms will follow suit by the time they graduate. They also think that if firms have money to pay raises, they must also have money to hire. Of course, historically this has not been true as small firms are generally not interested in keeping up with the Cravathians.

Noah Scheiber of the New York Times tried to put things into perspective and warn others in his [recent article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/business/dealbook/an-expensive-law-degree-and-no-place-to-use-it.html?_r=0) featuring an in-depth look at a lower-ranked law school with atrocious employment and bar passage rates. One person Scheiber profiled was an ex-cop who ended up setting up his own private practice with a partner. It is unclear whether he did this because he had no other options. The piece also featured another recent grad who now works at a convenience store but with a very inconvenient law school debt.

Also, most law school applicants don’t know the first thing about how a law firm operates. Some of these so-called elite firms cannot sustain the salary increases for long. A few people here have [suggested](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/) that some large law firms will have to cut bonuses, reduce future hiring, and even resort to layoffs if the salary boost makes the firm unprofitable. So it is possible that the salary increase will only make it more difficult to obtain an entry-level job at a major law firm.

Finally, will things remain the same in three years? The last salary increase happened in 2007. In 2008, there was a recession, and offers were either cancelled or deferred. And of course, everyone at ATL tried to turn lemons into lemonade by shaming the firms that laid off associates. Remember being Lathamed?

So in sum, news of the Biglaw salary increases is likely to attract a few people who would not have considered law school in the past. And their decision may be based in part by misinformation and optimistic idealism. These people are always going to be around. The only thing we can do is to help them make an informed decision.

One thing elite law firms and influencers can do is to announce associate raises between August to October. In other words, make the announcement soon after law schools start the semester. I have heard that firms now conduct on-campus interviews (OCIs) from July to August and extend offer letters to 3Ls the following fall. If this is true, then I don’t see how announcing the raises during those months will negatively affect the firms’ recruiting efforts. Also, it will give law school applicants about a year to observe how the market and commentators react to the salary increases. Within that time frame, applicants should be able to determine whether they have a fair shot at obtaining a job at a major law firm.

# Dropping A Bomb On The Legal Monopoly
## The Golden State’s bar mulls a monumental change to law firm ownership rules.

In 1942, in a secret lab built inside a squash court underneath a stadium at the University of Chicago, scientists from the Manhattan Project succeeded in generating the first controlled nuclear reaction. The resulting energy [wasn’t powerful enough to even power a light bulb](https://www.uchicago.edu/features/how_the_first_chain_reaction_changed_science/), but their success changed the world forever. More than anything else, the promise and threat of nuclear power defined the back half of the 20th century, for good and for ill.

Forgive me if it seems like hyperbole, but the legal industry may have taken its own first steps down a historic path a couple of months back. Earlier this year, California’s State Bar commissioned a report on online legal service delivery models to determine if there were ways to change its regulations that would both help increase access to the legal system and further the goal of public protection. They sent Professor [William Henderson](https://www.law.indiana.edu/about/people/bio.php?name=henderson-william-d) of Indiana University off to prepare a report, possibly expecting he would come back with a boilerplate bromide that read “online access is good, but also bad, so let’s make a minor change to a minor regulation and call it a day.”

If that was what the Bar expected, Professor Henderson had other ideas.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The Henderson Report was published in July, and you can [read it for yourself here](http://board.calbar.ca.gov/docs/agendaItem/Public/agendaitem1000022382.pdf). It advocates a sea change in the ethical rules governing attorneys.  Henderson breaks down the law into two segments, one serving ordinary individuals (“PeopleLaw”), and the other serving organizational clients. As most any private attorney can tell you, organizational clients are typically the easiest to build a career off of. They need more representation, they keep coming back once the relationship is established, and they tend to be more reliable paying their bills. Individuals, especially middle- and lower-class individuals, are harder to charge substantial rates to, and trickier to collect. Lawyers have therefore increasingly been competing for organizational clients, while the needs of PeopleLaw have gone increasingly unserved. PeopleLaw has been in a steady decline for the past 40 years. In just the five-year period from 2007-2012, the PeopleLaw sector shrank over 10 percent, meaning fewer attorneys are servicing those clients, and those attorneys are making less money.

That’s not to say things are rosy for the legal industry focused on organizational clients. Here, Henderson notes many of the same challenges I’ve discussed in this space [at length](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/biglaws-blockbuster-moment/), and the [systemic changes](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/king-kong-is-coming-to-crush-your-practice-with-a-calculator/) [our profession](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/in-defense-of-more-sizzle-less-steak/) [is undergoing](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/amazon-etsy-and-biglaw/). In short, alternative legal service providers and non-traditional law firm models are taking bigger and bigger bites out of the mid-tier and lower-tier law firm markets, while the upper-tier work is consolidating further and further into the few mega-firms at the top. Meanwhile, corporate clients are keeping more work in house to avoid ever-increasing law firm rates. Competition is fiercer than it’s ever been, and many firms aren’t demonstrating the capability or desire to change with the times and face these incoming challenges. Given that historical indicators suggest our economy is headed for a correction, and many firms aren’t even back to the shape they were in before 2008, the legal industry may be headed for deeply difficult times.

While I’ve been focused on these indicators as indicating trouble for law firms, Professor Henderson sees those same indicators as deeply troubling for the public at large. Professor Henderson’s research suggests that these market forces are making it more and more expensive for ordinary citizens to afford legal services, and there are few substitutes available to them. More and more people are choosing to go without legal representation, be it in court appearances or in transactional matters like estate planning or contract drafting. Some of the slack is being picked up by legal start-ups like [Docracy](https://www.docracy.com/) or [LawTrades](https://www.lawtrades.com/), but overall the population of people who can’t get served by the legal profession is only growing.

Typically, an underserved market is a tremendous opportunity for the first person to figure out how to serve that market successfully. There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of industries that successfully cater to the public at large. So why can’t lawyers figure out how to crack this nut? The problem, according to Henderson, is chiefly one of managerial skill and industrial competence. Small-time practitioners just don’t have the resources or managerial training to implement systems to handle the kinds of low-stakes, high-volume work that PeopleLaw comprises. We’re trained to be attorneys, not business managers, and small operations don’t have the cash in pocket at any given time they would need to staff up, buy new software, and hope to generate a bunch of new business. In an ideal world, most attorneys need people with leadership skills and expertise to run their firms efficiently while the attorney spends their time out generating work and practicing law. In almost every other industry, management manages the company, and frees the talent up to produce the revenue.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The legal industry has denied itself the key component of these types of relationships with non-lawyers: equity. Most companies looking to grow can give management a piece of the company itself in lieu of a salary. The company preserves its cash for its expansion, while the management gets to bet on its own success and participate in the upside of growth. Law firms can’t do that. Every single bar in the United States (save the District of Columbia) prohibits the ownership of law firms by non-lawyers. Our management class has to be 100% composed of attorneys, who typically have zero training in institutional management, and we typically expect those attorneys to also practice law and bring in their own book of business. We’ve cut ourselves off from the pool of managers that could be leading our firms into the future, and as a result we’re also leaving more and more ordinary individuals without any legal representation at all. This we should not abide.

Henderson’s proposed solution follows elegantly from his premises: let’s stop cutting our own legs out from under us. Relax the rules regarding law firm ownership, like the UK and Australia have done before us, and open the market up to innovation and investment from outside the legal industry. Doing so would mean law firms servicing organizational clients could upgrade their profitability and fight back against the alternative legal service providers on equal footing, while their organizational clients get better service than ever before. Attorneys in the PeopleLaw industry could get access to resources and expertise that would allow them to serve more people, more efficiently, for better results both to the public good and their private pockets.

Professor Henderson was sent to catch a fish and came back with a whale. Although there are plenty of [skeptics](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/yet-another-access-to-justice-debate-has-the-legal-profession-reached-an-inflection-point/), I think he’s onto something. I’ve long said the legal industry badly needs innovation and fresh ideas. Now, based on Henderson’s Report, I agree that that innovation won’t just help lawyers like me; it will help the kinds of ordinary citizens that need legal protection the most. For our own good, and for the public’s, we need to take the Henderson Report, and its recommendations, seriously.

And to the State Bar of California: the ball’s in your squash court now.

# Powerhouse Compensation Leader Raises Salaries For All U.S. Associates
## The firm that started the salary raise movement is making history, again.

Back in 1999, one incredibly daring law firm laid the groundwork for associate salaries to soar. This firm made huge waves when it offered new associates a starting salary of $125,000 — significantly higher than the $100,000 that was standard at the time. The pay raise soon spread to firms across the country, and nothing has ever been the same since.

The firm we’re speaking about is Silicon Valley powerhouse Gunderson Dettmer, a gutsy institution that could very well be referred to as the O.G. of Biglaw salary raises. Today, the Silicon Valley-based firm is matching the Cravath base salary raise across all of its offices. With other offices in Ann Arbor, Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and San Diego, Gunderson will improve associates’ wealth across the country.

Here’s an excerpt from Gunderson’s salary raise memo, sent by chairman and founding partner [Robert V. Gunderson Jr.](http://www.gunder.com/people/robert-v.-gunderson,-jr):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As most of you know, the firm has long been a leader in the area of Associate compensation. On behalf of the Partners, we are delighted to announce these increases and we thank you for your extraordinary efforts in providing clients with outstanding service as well as in helping us build the pre-eminent firm in the markets in which we operate.

Gunderson’s salary raise is being applied to summer associates currently working at the firm, while compensation for more senior associates will be communicated separately. As we mentioned previously, we will be discussing compensation for senior associates and counsel in a future post. (It should also be noted that the firm’s Ann Arbor office was not included in the firmwide email to associates announcing the salary raise. Perhaps this was a clerical error, or perhaps since the office was [opened in September 2015](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150924006534/en/Gunderson-Dettmer-Opens-Midwest-Office), there aren’t any associates working there yet to take advantage of these salary raises.)

Congratulations to everyone at Gunderson Dettmer! You’re joining three large firms and three boutiques who’ve already made history. It’s time to celebrate!

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

Elon Musk (Photo by Diego Donamaria/Getty Images for SXSW)

I know the headline seems like a weird Mad Libs moment [Biglaw Firm] Quotes [Musician] Representing [Controversial Billionaire] — but it’s true. [Alex Spiro](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/spiro-alex), partner in the New York office of Quinn Emanuel where he co-chairs the Investigations, Government Enforcement & White Collar Defense practice, decided to [spice up his briefing](https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/03/business/elon-musk-eminem-lawyer-sec/index.html) in Elon Musk’s legal battle with the Securities Exchange Commission. He quoted Eminem, subbing out the rapper’s beef with the FCC with Musk’s issues with the SEC, from the 2002 hit, Without Me.

“The (SEC) won’t let me be or let me be me so let me see; They tried to shut me down,” he wrote.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  

Musk is trying to have his 2018 consent decree with the SEC, which requires preapproval from the agency before tweeting, thrown out. His saltiness over the issue [is legendary in Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-firm-chooses-associate-over-elon-musk/), and Spiro focused on the First Amendment issue in his brief:

“First Amendment requires that agencies proceed with caution when constitutional rights are at stake, not seek to pursue any and all novel theories that broaden their authority at the cost of individual freedom.”

[Spiro is a white collar star, known for](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/quinn-emanuel-pulls-off-coup-with-big-time-criminal-defense-hire/) taking on high profile celebrity clients like [Jay-Z](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/jay-z-declares-war-against-the-lack-of-diversity-in-the-arbitration-world/), NBA player Thabo Sefolosha, rapper Bobby Shmurda, Aaron Hernandez and more. So perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised that his writing can really capture an audience’s attention.

# What Font Should You Use For Your Résumé? Apparently This Matters To People.

Ed. note: The original version of this article first appeared in 2015. But you’re still writing résumés so let’s revisit this subject.

Over the last few weeks, there’s been not one, not two, but at least six mainstream media articles about what font you “absolutely must use” on your résumé. [Business News Daily](http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5331-best-resume-fonts.html), [Bloomberg Business](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-27/the-best-and-worst-fonts-to-use-on-your-r-sum-), [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/28/times-new-roman-resume-best-worst-fonts_n_7167390.html), [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/videos/money/business/2015/04/29/26570385/), [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2015/04/28/402736024/for-a-resume-type-font-matters), even [The Onion](http://www.theonion.com/americanvoices/typography-expert-times-new-roman-bad-choice-resum-50320) got in on this action. And it’s not like everyone suddenly had a typographic epiphany: each of these articles piggybacks off the one before it. It’s a frigging style-piece tsunami out there.

Why not get swept up in it too? Let the waves of modern journalism wash over us.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Do you think the font you choose for your résumé really matters? Meh, it probably does. Somewhere less than “having a T14 degree” and more than “the brand of your leather folio,” but it still probably matters a little — especially if you envision some sap pouring over thousands of résumés at once. But is that really how law firm hiring decisions get made? Even at on-campus interviewing I only ever had 10 or 11 meetings in a day. And when I stopped going on campus, I never looked at more than 2 or 3 at a time.

Ultimately, I can’t help but think The Onion’s coverage of this probably hits the nail on the head:

“Nothing says ‘I’m currently unemployed’ like a painstakingly selected font.”

But let’s indulge this call to adventure and check out some of the fonts recommended in these articles by using them in action by converting select sentences from an actual cover letter from a current candidate looking for a job — a former mid-level Biglaw associate, laid off during the recession:

Times New Roman — Hurray! You have Microsoft Word! Good for you. Hell, even Microsoft Word stopped using Times New Roman as the default, that’s how much it sucks. And yet here it is on the recommended list. Actually, this was the most controversial selection to come out of these articles. Some of the experts polled for the litany of articles described the venerable standby as a safe option. Others described it as lazy. Indeed, one creative director said, “It’s like putting on sweatpants.” This [isn’t a new opinion in these pages](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/small-firms-big-lawyers-the-perfect-font-to-show-you-don%E2%80%99t-care/).

On the other hand, the legal industry isn’t filled with people who respect rocking the boat. While it’s not true that every court expects submissions in boring, old Times New Roman, most still put it on a very limited list of acceptable options. So when you’re writing up your résumé, do you want to convey to your future Biglaw masters that you’re “boring/traditional” or “bold/rebellious”? Because it’s going to be hard to thread that needle. Thankfully, some fonts exist that get you there.

Trebuchet — Like this one, if you’re not into the whole “flowery serifs” thing. Personally, I like a mild serif because it makes it look like something’s actually happening on the page. If letters get too minimalist, the document starts to look more like some utilitarian sign pointing you to the nearest dog run than a document with a human face behind it. Trebuchet is just about as minimalist as one can get before some funky effects start infecting your résumé.

Helvetica — Like with this font. Bloomberg Business chose Helvetica as the best possible font for job-seekers. I call bulls**t. Not that it didn’t [make for an interesting movie](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VWEFP8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000VWEFP8&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkId=JQHVWL2HQ24DI7QH) (affiliate link), but the point of the documentary was how much everyone hates the ubiquitous, blocky, space-guzzling typeface. At one point in the film, it’s described as “fascist.” How a font that attracts that much ire ever made it onto any list of recommendations boggles the mind. If you’re writing a subway sign, use Helvetica. That said, this is the same reporter who published the [Five Charts That Show You Should Apply To Law School This Year](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-22/five-charts-that-show-you-should-apply-to-law-school-this-year), so she may be suffering through a concussion.

If you’re writing a résumé — or God help you a brief — use something else.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Arial — Business News Daily suggested Arial, which is just a knockoff of Helvetica. The lesson here is that Business News Daily is too cheap to have the original Helvetica on their computers.

Calibri — Finally, a suggestion that won’t chew up the entire page. It’s clear and legible. A little boring though. It’s almost too minimalist, which can bite you in the ass when you try to describe your work experience and it barely fills a line and a half. There’s definitely a Goldilocks effect here: Helvetica looks like you’re trying to snowball them by padding out every word, while Calibri looks like you sketched your first draft on a Post-It note.

Garamond — For my money, this is the Baby Bear’s porridge. There are serifs that make it look like something interesting is actually happening on the page, but it’s not as flourished and played out as Times New Roman. This was the choice of The Onion too:

“Garamond it is. Glad I never have to think about this ever again.”

Comic Sans — Everyone agreed that unless you’re [expressing your frustration with LeBron James](http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/07/09/comic.sans.cavs.james/), you don’t use Comic Sans.

And once again, Wingdings is overlooked.

# Biglaw Firm Offering Employees Paid Time Off To Vote
## Biglaw firm is making sure their employees have the time to vote.

In a move believed to be a first amongst Biglaw firms, yesterday[ Steptoe & Johnson announced](https://www.steptoe.com/en/news-publications/steptoe-encourages-employees-to-vote-with-flexible-leave-policy.html) its participation in get-out-the-vote initiatives. The firm has joined the non-partisan [ElectionDay.org](http://electionday.org/) and [MakeTimetoVote.org](http://maketimetovote.org/), and they’ll be providing all employees with two hours of paid time off so they can vote.

To make it easier to vote in the 2018 midterm elections on Tuesday, November 6, Steptoe is providing two hours of paid leave to those who choose to vote at the beginning or end of their workday to allow for unexpected delays at polling stations, including long lines. The firm is also allowing additional flexibility during the work day for those needing more time to vote.

This is a great move that should be widely applauded and followed by other firms. Obviously, this is a great boon to employees who are paid hourly or have specific hours requirements. But this also speaks volumes about the culture the firm is trying to create. While most associates probably aren’t super worried about the paid part of the paid time off — their total billable hours aren’t going to take a big hit after all, and most firms provide associates with generous time-off policies (not that associates usually take full advantage of them) — but this sends the message that voting is an important thing that everyone should make time for. You don’t need to stealthily creep into your office if you walk in a little late on November 6th, not when the firm is publicly supporting get out the vote efforts.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Cooley To Defer Incoming Associates Again, But This Time The Firm Is Offering A Six-Figure Paycheck
## We're beginning to wonder if any other Biglaw firms will be deferring incoming first-years.

It’s turning out to be a hot deferral summer in Biglaw.

Back in April, following a [round of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/), Cooley kicked off the race to shrink incoming associate classes by [deferring its first-years](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/after-layoffs-last-year-cooley-delays-start-date-for-first-year-associates/) to January 2024. Then, Fenwick [jumped on the bandwagon](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/fenwick-deferral-associates-corporate-technology/), deferring only its incoming corporate and technology transactions first-years to January 2024. Now Cooley is back, and this time the firm means business — but only for its entry-level corporate associates.

According to a report by [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/cooley-to-delay-some-first-year-associate-start-dates-by-year), soon-to-be first-years in the firm’s corporate practice group have options: delaying their start dates by a year, or starting in January 2024 and switching to a busier practice group. For those who decide to take the year-long deferral, there’s a $100,000 stipend to be had (less than half of their projected first-year salaries).

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Cooley offered the following statement to [Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/cooley-to-delay-some-first-year-associate-start-dates-by-year):

“We can confirm that due to current market conditions we will be reassigning a limited number of incoming corporate associates to alternate practice areas.

We are also offering a voluntary full year deferral to this same limited group of incoming associates along with a stipend to compensate for their deferral. We continue to be focused on ensuring that all our associates have the opportunity to receive meaningful development opportunities throughout their tenure with us.”

Will Cooley’s incoming corporate first-years choose to take the money and run? Only time will tell.

Is your firm planning to start making major deferral offers to associates? If you have any intel, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Best of luck to all affected incoming associates at Cooley.

# Biglaw Staff Subject To Layoffs May Be SOL When It Comes To Finding New Jobs

During this time, if positions or jobs are being eliminated, I would not anticipate that there would be a complete recovery or restoration to what things were like pre-COVID. I think that it’s going to be very stiff competition in that realm of the job market. So, I would say their chances [at getting another job in the legal industry] are half now than they were before.

— Nakia Bradley-Lawson, president of legal professionals association NALS Inc. and director of operations and facilities at Gevurtz Menashe Larson & Howe PC, commenting on the [post-layoff job prospects, or lack thereof](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/1313977/as-furloughs-become-layoffs-what-s-next-for-firm-staff-), for Biglaw administrative staff whose furloughs later turned into permanent job losses thanks to the adoption of automation and outsourcing.

# It's Raining In December! Salary Money, That Is
## Today's bonuses are brought to you by the rainmakers!

Though it may feel like all we cover at ATL are New York firms and [racist judges](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/on-this-weeks-episode-of-judicial-misconduct-percocet-slurs/), we are always happy to get a tip about how different markets are doing their legal thing. And today is one of those happy days. Raking in $372,959,000 gross revenue in 2020 and placed 100th in the 2021 Am Law 200 ranking, Baker Donelson has some money coming down the pipeline for its employees. Speaking of gross income, first year associates in some markets will notice that their salaries have been raised to $185,000; seventh years will be seeing up to $285,000!

That’s what the scale will look like in Atlanta, Baltimore, Ft. Lauderdale, Houston, Nashville, and DC. Birmingham, Memphis, Orlando, and Raleigh will now start at $150K. Associates in Baton Rouge, Chattanooga, Columbia, Jackson, Johnson City, Knoxville, Macon, Mandeville, New Orleans, and Tallahassee will go to a $135K scale.

Now that is some money. Do you know how many cans of Arizona iced tea you could buy with that? At least fifteen — give or take. Trust, they should be well prepared for Dollar Tree’s [price bump](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2021/11/24/dollar-tree-prices-increase/8750000002/).

But wait, there’s more!

The firm will also be giving additional payouts based on the amount of hours worked.

1900: 5000
2000: 10% of salary
2100: 15% of salary
2200: 20% of salary

I know you’ve been waiting on Netflix to release the second half of Stone Ocean, but you’d probably be better off logging those hours instead of watching episodes anyway.

# Well, That's Just A Bad Law

As lawyers, we’re obliged to uphold the law…. but that doesn’t always mean you agree with it. Attorneys are in a unique position to know the underbelly of the system of laws that govern our society.

So, we want to know, what is *the* worst law?

Perhaps it’s the fact that qualified immunity — the doctrine that lets police get away with pretty much everything — was a [goddamn scrivener’s error](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/police-can-legally-set-you-on-fire-because-someone-in-the-1800s-made-a-copying-error/). And what about the [immunity of the gun industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/the-law-the-needs-to-be-repealed-immediately-to-bring-gun-makers-to-heel/)? That only makes the American gun problem worse. Maybe it’s the[ injustice of the felony murder](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/it-looks-like-sotomayor-is-1-of-3-supreme-court-justices-who-actually-believes-the-whole-do-the-crime-do-the-time-thing/) rule? Speaking of injustice, maybe [mandatory minimums](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/scotus-plays-hell-with-congressional-intent-in-mandatory-minimums-case/) infuriate you. Let’s not get started on the [dumb immigration laws](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-does-the-doj-prosecute-20000-people-a-year-for-immigration-crimes/). We’ve all witnessed the wild results the [electoral college yields](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/why-is-the-electoral-college-constitutional/). Or maybe you’re annoyed by the simple power grabs like towns putting an [age limit on trick or treating](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/you-are-too-old-to-trick-or-treat-like-by-law/).

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Associate Raises Aren't Finished -- Another Biglaw Firm Ups Base Compensation
## Raises but no special summer bonuses for these associates.

July may be in its death throes but that doesn’t mean Biglaw firms don’t have cash to throw around.

Just today, Bracewell announced in the firm’s Monday meeting they were getting on board with the top-of-the-line associate pay scale, and even though the announced them at the end of the month they are retroactive to July 1. The raises will go to all U.S. associates except those in Seattle and San Antonio (those locales are left to the murky waters of individualized compensation).

In case you don’t have the latest and greatest Biglaw pay scale memorized just yet, here it is:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Class of 2017: $190,000
Class of 2016: $200,000
Class of 2015: $220,000
Class of 2014: $255,000
Class of 2013: $280,000
Class of 2012: $305,000
Class of 2011: $325,000
Class of 2010: $340,000

The bad news is that the firm has declined to provide their associates with special summer bonuses, as many competitor firms are doing this year.

So far, the reaction seems to be lukewarm, but happy with the raises:

We had known for weeks that something along these lines was coming and that it would apply back to July 1, so people weren’t getting too nervous. I can’t speak for Seattle and San Antonio associates, but others are generally happy with this announcement. It seems like a reasonable approach for our firm.

For the most part, no summer bonus was expected. For high billers, year end bonus are already above mkt (1.3x), so the firm makes it up on the back end

Though a tipster says those bonuses come at a hefty hours requirement:

Bonuses here are horrible, 25% at 2k hours, generally need 2300 for full ny

# California Bar Exam Cut From Three Days To Two
## Major reform for one of the most idiosyncratic -- and toughest -- bar exams in the nation.

Rejoice, future California lawyers! The CA State Bar Board of Trustees just voted to scale back the state’s onerous three-day exam, said by some to be the [hardest bar exam in the country](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/04/which-state-has-the-most-difficult-bar-exam/), to a more comfortable two-day affair.

This isn’t an entirely unexpected development. Back in March, Excess of Democracy [reported that](http://excessofdemocracy.com/blog/2015/3/california-poised-to-cut-bar-exam-from-three-days-to-two) that California was weighing a proposal to alter the test format to include one day of essays (5 one-hour essays and a 90-minute performance test) and one day of the MBE, with both days weighed equally. As noted in that post, this scales back the performance test from its previous 3-hour length. This may not make the test “easier” — indeed, California will probably shift the scoring around to maintain their famously high standards — but the process of sitting for the exam will definitely become a lot more pleasant. It also raises the possibility of California bar candidates taking a second state’s test.

News of the vote spread throughout the Twittersphere over the last hour, with the State Bar Law Practice Management and Technology Committee tweeting about the unanimous vote:

The State Bar of [#California](https://twitter.com/hashtag/California?src=hash) Board of Trustees vote unanimously to shorten bar exam to two days from three, beginning July 2017. [#calbar](https://twitter.com/hashtag/calbar?src=hash)

— LPMT Section (@calbarlpmt) [July 27, 2015](https://twitter.com/calbarlpmt/status/625752307796348928)

The change will take place effective July 2017, so condolences to all the rising 3Ls out there who have to sweat out another marathon session next July (and, God forbid, the following February).

We reached out to the California State Bar earlier, but they did not have anyone available to comment on such short notice. We will edit this story to include any statement they may offer.

Meanwhile, every California lawyer should start working on their “in my day…” stories about how newly minted lawyers are soft. Those should keep everyone entertained for a few decades.

As law firms prepare for whatever new normal may emerge, it’s becoming increasingly clear that technology adoption is the key to maintaining a competitive advantage.

In the 2021 Biglaw Decision-Makers Survey — conducted with our friends at Wolters Kluwer — we sought to gain the views of those guiding the industry’s biggest players on the role of technology.

We asked about the importance of technology to varied aspects of a lawyer’s professional life, the industry’s performance in delivering optimal client service, and the risks of falling behind.

Cyndie Chang, delivering her president’s address at the 2016 NAPABA Convention.

“Hey yo, I’m just like my country / I’m young, scrappy, and hungry / And I’m not throwing away my shot!” — Lin-Manual Miranda, “My Shot,” Hamilton

Last weekend, the [National Asian Pacific American Bar Association](http://www.napaba.org/) (NAPABA) hosted their 28th National Convention in San Diego, California.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Nearly 2,000 members attended this year’s convention, making it the most popular NAPABA meeting to date. With fourteen Article III Judges, numerous state judges, senior partners, law professors, and trailblazers in attendance, it was one of the most impressive conventions to date as well. Even though [George Takei](https://twitter.com/navdeepsinghjd/status/795118418911318016) was the recipient of NABAPA’s 2016 Inspire Award, he said that it was attorneys who inspire him to be civically engaged.

There was a feeling amongst the younger lawyers and law students that we were standing on the shoulders of giants. We felt blessed to have the opportunity to meet so many luminaries in one place. There was also a sense in the room that many veteran lawyers were excited to pass the torch of community building, pro-bono involvement, and trailblazing to greener lawyers. Lawyers are at their best when they are serving, and NAPABA is a community testament to this.

During a lunch panel, Judge [Sri Srinivasan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/03/14/three-reasons-that-nominating-sri-srinivasan-for-the-supreme-court-could-change-u-s-elections/) of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stressed how important it is to generations before us that we do our part to ensure progress, but it is even more important to generations after us that we do our part to advance progress.

In her inaugural address, [Cyndie Chang](http://www.duanemorris.com/attorneys/cyndiemchang.html), NAPABA President and managing partner of the Los Angeles office of Duane Morris, discussed how important NAPABA, family, and community are to her. Her family’s legacy of helping to build our nation’s infrastructure, rebuild the Japanese-American sense of community in Los Angeles, and pass down immigrant values to her left an indelible impression on me. I believe her story will resonate with you as well. On Sunday, I had the opportunity to catch up with Chang.

Here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:


Cyndie Chang (by Bradford Rogne Photography)

RC: What does NAPABA mean to you? And why is it important for you to be a leader in this organization?

CC: NAPABA is my family. This sentiment arose from attending a NAPABA convention well over a decade ago where I was embraced in the NAPABA community with a sense of welcome, belonging, and collaboration.

RC: Why should lawyers join and become involved in bar associations?

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
CC: I know I wouldn’t have had the legal opportunities and leadership experience were it not for the connections I made through the bar associations and the opportunities to lead through active involvement in the bar association. I have been and continue to be guided by many bar leaders and mentors, who have spent a great deal of time in paving the way for minorities and women in the profession. Bar associations provide a great affinity network and community.

We all feed off each other, and we all succeed together. Bar associations that are successful are those that encourage their members to work together and to give to each other and the organization, which includes volunteerism, leadership, pro bono, mentorship, sponsorship, and referrals.

RC: You were told by a partner, very early in your career, that you wouldn’t make it as a trial lawyer. How were you able to rebound from this, and how have you used this as motivation throughout your life?

CC: As a junior associate, a major partner of my law firm told me I’d never be a trial lawyer because I was too quiet and meek. Maybe I was, or maybe I was painted with the brush of implicit bias because I’m an Asian-American woman.

I am grateful for that comment because that lit a fire under me to become a trial lawyer and an office managing partner of an Am Law 100 firm, the first Asian-American in that role in its over 100-year history. What helped me overcome the doubt that was directed to me as a young lawyer was to find and eventually stay at a place that valued my contribution to the firm. My current firm had faith in me and my leadership, and it made such a difference to work in a positive environment and a place that believed in me.

RC: Currently, minority attorneys are struggling to make the transition from associates to partners. Why do you think this is, and what are some possible ways we could address this struggle?

CC: I would first encourage minority attorneys to have excellence in their work product, as that is a baseline to build your legal career. In addition, it is important to own and value your reputation in the community where you treat others with respect.

I will not say that the path to partnership is easy. We still unfortunately face overt or implicit bias in our profession, and many of us have our own respective war stories where we have had to go above and beyond just to demonstrate our competency and to garner respect and trust.

As we strive for partnership or leadership, I encourage readers to anticipate that there will be challenging times, and during those times, please don’t doubt yourselves. I almost did and it could have derailed my career. That’s part of having grit. We’ve all had to have grit and to find our own voice, and that will be further developed as we encounter each new challenge.

Renwei Chung (RC): Many of us in the audience were inspired by the remarks about your family in your inaugural speech. For those who weren’t able to attend this year’s NAPABA Convention, could you briefly share your family’s role in rebuilding and restoring many Japanese Americans’ sense of community in Los Angeles?

Cyndie Chang (CC): My President’s speech at the NAPABA convention detailed my personal and family story that is rooted in immigration and assimilation to the U.S., and it emphasized our community’s strength during hard times and overcoming adversity. One of the stories I shared involved my grandfather and his partners’ humble little Chinese restaurant. The restaurant, the Far East Café, opened in 1935, serving the Japanese-American community in what is now called Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. The remnants of the restaurant still stand today, with its neon sign that says “Chop Suey.”

After WWII and the internment camps, many Japanese Americans came back home to nothing, but they returned to the Far East Cafe that continued to serve families needing to rebuild. Apparently the Far East Cafe was popular to generations of Japanese Americans who wanted to celebrate weddings, birthday parties, and other milestones there. If one didn’t have enough money to pay for a meal, that was OK there because you could just wash dishes or you’d make it up next time because there was an understanding that we all had to stick together and look out for each other in hard times.

While the restaurant had great Chinese food, its greater significance was it being an informal hub of the Japanese-American community after the camps. And, the building is now designated a national historic landmark.

RC: What life and lawyerly advice do you have for law school students and recent graduates?

CC: I think many of us experienced incidents of unfairness and missed opportunities as a result of unconscious bias, whether it is because of the color of our skin, our age, our sex, or background. And, on top of that, many of us are juggling other balls in the air, like staying active in the community or maintaining roles as a parent, spouse, or caregiver.

There is a lot to balance, with the backdrop of the pressures and stress, in our profession. I can say from personal experience that it’s exhausting, but also fulfilling, especially if you are involved in the community and passionate about causes important to you.

Please remember to take of yourself as you are not alone in times of stress, anxiety, and pressure, and we all need to take a deep breath and be cognizant of the present, so we can enjoy this journey of a long and fulfilling legal career.

RC: On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Cyndie Chang for sharing her experience and wisdom with our audience. We wish her continued success in her career.

Spring is in the air, and bonus season is here once again. We don’t usually see many bonuses in March, but like 2020, 2021 is turning out to be an odd year.

Since we broke the news of the special bonus scale for associates and counsel at large law firms in the United States — a trend that was [started by Willkie](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) on Friday, March 19, 2021 (offering between $7,500 and $40,000), and quickly [one-upped by Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) on Monday, March 22, 2021 (offering between $12,000 and $64,000) — many firms quickly fell in line and matched the generous scale. When will your firm announce its special bonuses?

As usual, we are compiling a table of all the firms that have already matched the special bonus scale, the minimum hours required to receive those bonuses (if available), and the date those bonuses will be paid. Today, we unveil that table for your viewing pleasure. We will be updating this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as news on bonuses is announced. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs clarification, [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Special%20Bonus%20Scorecard%20Correction).

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Help us help you now (and if/when you decide to make a lateral move in the future). Let us know what your firm’s minimum billable hours targets are for special bonus eligibility and when your firm will pay those bonuses. You generally must remain at your firm until the payout date to receive them, as stated in most memos, which could make it all the more difficult for you to leave your job.

As a little reminder, we love covering Biglaw bonuses, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you’re worried about metadata in a PDF/Word file.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on motherhood in the legal profession, in partnership with our friends at [MothersEsquire](https://www.mothersesquire.com/). Welcome Amanda M. Fisher to our pages.

Prior to COVID-19, women entered law school at [equal or higher](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/women/current_glance_2019.pdf) rates than men but did not achieve the same level of professional success as men. Women constitute [38% of the profession and earn salaries that are 76% of male](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2018/05/women-lawyers.html) attorneys’ salaries. Male equity partners still make [27% more](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/women/current_glance_2019.pdf) than female equity partners. These numbers are telling, but the day-to-day experiences of women in the profession are staggering. Imagine being financially penalized for taking maternity leave as allowed by firm policy despite meeting every obligation before and after your leave, or being told by an employer that you do not need a raise because you got married and now have two incomes. But we actually don’t have to imagine because these stories are real and they are recent.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Why do women lag behind men in the profession? The simplest answer is that the legal profession is resistant to change. A greedy institution is an institution that requires total commitment by its members. A common example is the military — by joining, you give up individual freedoms. Law is also a [greedy institution](https://books.google.com/books/about/Greedy_Institutions_Patterns_of_Undivide.html?id=FxhBAAAAIAAJ). Not surprisingly, so is family, particularly for women because of [traditional social expectations](https://books.google.com/books/about/Greedy_Institutions_Patterns_of_Undivide.html?id=FxhBAAAAIAAJ). For women in law, this often translates into a tug-of-war between [family and career.](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Part_time_Paradox/SJdIAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Epstein,+Seron,+Oglensky+%26+Saute,+1999&printsec=frontcover)

Law is steeped in tradition, but COVID-19 ravaged several pillars to which the legal profession was moored. For example, time at the office was the highest currency before the pandemic, despite many lawyers, often parents — usually mothers — requesting flexible schedules and remote options. Yet during COVID-19, employers were forced to reassess whether time in the office is worth more than the safety of their employees. So, if we can make changes to keep the profession running during a pandemic, we can also reimagine the profession in a less-gendered way. Here are five ideas to advance gender equity in the profession:

(1) Show compassion. Be flexible with schedules when you can, both in person and remotely. Understand that even when working from home parents may need to turn off cameras during meetings particularly when children are present. If there is a way to accommodate caretakers that does not affect their work performance, just allow it. Most people are working very hard to keep up with professional and personal obligations.

(2) Commiserate. Be vocal about your struggles with juggling everything during these strange times. Others who may not be dealing with the same struggles may be able to benefit from seeing what working parents handle. We can all develop more empathy for one another. When all of this began, I did my best to pretend that my son was not home with me. This meant I never turned on my camera for meetings because I was afraid he would come into the frame. I rarely spoke up about anything because I was afraid he would be heard in the background and my colleagues would be annoyed. I tried to schedule meetings during his nap-time or when he would be occupied by my spouse during his lunch break. This was unrealistic. Once I let the curtain fall, I found support from colleagues who have children, and empathy from those who do not, about what life looks like for me right now.

(3) Be creative. Encourage your employees to come to you with problems so you can work together to forge a solution. I was recently interviewing a male firm partner for my dissertation. We were discussing why women seem to be behind in the profession, and he surmised that women miss out on experience when they are out of the workforce for caretaking obligations. I pressed him on this slightly, asking about whether women cultivate skills while on leave that would be beneficial in a firm environment. After a moment of reflection and some creative thinking, he then decided that yes, that was true. He told me about how his wife developed marketable skills from her time at home with their children, and if a potential employee cited those skills on a resume or in an interview, he would consider that to be more favorable than an unexplained gap. Allowing space to consider new ideas will help form creative solutions to complex problems, such as gender equality in the profession.

(4) Continue to challenge the status quo. I am not sure anyone believes we will “go back to normal” in the future, but we will settle into a new normal. Everyone, particularly people in positions of power and authority, should consistently reassess how their work environment can be improved.

(5) Put it in writing. Commit to your employees by putting policies in writing. For example, if your firm does not have a policy on parental leave and on how annual billable hours requirements, raises, and bonuses will be affected by an employee taking parental leave, then it is a perfect time to brainstorm the best fit for your workplace.

COVID-19 destroyed the profession’s cognitive scaffolding — truths we once knew are no longer valid. Now it is up to us to rebuild by shifting expectations out of tradition and into a more equal reality for current and future attorneys.

In late October, Alec Baldwin fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, 42, with a prop gun on the movie set of the film “Rust.” As we [previously noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/cinematographer-shot-by-alec-baldwin-was-wife-of-latham-watkins-associate/), Matt Hutchins, Halyna’s husband, is a corporate associate in the Los Angeles office of Latham & Watkins, and now it looks like the widower has lawyered up.

According to the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-11-03/halyna-hutchins-wrongful-death-rust-movie), Hutchins has hired [Panish Shea Boyle Ravipudi](https://www.psblaw.com/), an L.A.-based plaintiffs’ firm specializing in wrongful-death litigation. [Brian Panish](https://www.psblaw.com/panish.html) will act as lead counsel.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
A spokesman for the law firm confirmed that it had been retained by the Hutchins family but declined to comment on any plans to file suit.

“Respecting Mr. Hutchins’ request for privacy as the family grieves the loss of Halyna Hutchins, the firm will not be making any statements at this time,” the firm said.

A family spokesperson noted that Hutchins “remains focused on taking care of his son and processing his grief.” For those who wish to honor Halyna, a rising star in her industry, the American Film Institute has established a scholarship in her memory. Please click [here](https://www.afi.com/halyna-hutchins-scholarship-fund/?form=FUNYUNXCHMH) to make a donation.

We at Above the Law continue to extend our condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of Halyna and Matt Hutchins during this especially difficult time.

# Quinn Emanuel Hit With Racial Discrimination Suit
## The plaintiff alleges the firm didn't adequately protect him after he complained about the discrimination.

A new lawsuit filed against litigation powerhouse Quinn Emanuel claims the firm participated in racial discrimination, failed to adequately protect the alleged victim, and then fired him.

The plaintiff is Nicholas Mondelo, a Hispanic-American of Spanish origin, who in 2015 served as Quinn Emanuel’s IT director for its East Coast and Midwest operations and was later demoted to overseeing only the firm’s New York office. Mondelo claims he one of the only Hispanics in the firm’s IT department, and that he was allegedly “subjected to a constant stream of harassment, ridicule, and abuse” from defendant David Eskanos, the firm’s former chief information officer. According to the complaint, Eskanos referred to Mondelo using a racist slur related to his Spanish heritage. Mondelo then reported Eskanos to human resources, and two partners who are both named as defendants — Peter Calamari, the then-managing partner of Quinn Emanuel’s New York office, and Richard Schirtzer, the then-managing partner of Quinn Emanuel’s Los Angeles office — were assigned to act as a “buffer” between him and Eskanos. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/03/23/ex-it-manager-sues-quinn-emanuel-for-racial-discrimination/) has more details:

That arrangement allegedly continued until March 2018, when Calamari stepped down from his role leading the New York office and allegedly told Mondelo he would no longer be serving as a buffer. Around the same time, the firm hired a new East Coast IT leader and stripped Mondelo of his authority over the firm’s Chicago and Washington, D.C., offices, leaving just New York under his purview.

While working under the new intermediary, Mondelo felt that he was being set up by Eskanos to botch the rollout of a new software system in New York, according to the complaint. He ultimately had a breakdown and was committed to the Jersey City Medical Center in May 2019, after which he was fired by the firm.

Mondelo claims he was involuntarily committed a second time on the same day he lost his job with the firm, and was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder. According to the complaint, Mondelo has been unable to secure new job since the time of his firing and was hospitalized in January 2020 after attempting suicide.

A Quinn Emanuel spokesperson said of the lawsuit: “We are disappointed that Mr. Mondelo has chosen to take this action. His claims are without merit.”

LeClairRyan, once a 400-attorney firm with offices across the country, has [filed for bankruptcy](http://www.virginiabusiness.com/news/article/leclairryan-files-for-bankruptcy). The filing has been expected ever since the firm’s dramatic, highly public meltdown began in July with the departure of its founding partner, Gary LeClair, which I’ve been tracing in this column for the past month.

For this last of three pieces about LeClairRyan, I spoke with former firm partners who were there for a key transitional point in the firm’s management culture. The portrait they painted was one of a firm culture that shifted from openness to secrecy, and from meritocracy to patronage, and from smart growth to a desperate search for cash to cover for past mistakes. But more than anything, the story that starts to emerge is one that reads more like that of a would-be emperor imperceptibly and unwittingly transforming into an ersatz Bernie Madoff. Gary LeClair aggressively pursued growth for his firm, at first for its own sake, but later because that growth may have been all that was keeping the firm afloat. When that unsustainable growth stopped, the wheels came off, and the knives came out.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Business was booming throughout the legal industry in the mid-1990s, and LeClairRyan was taking advantage. According to former partner David Nagle, Gary LeClair was successfully growing his firm by luring over young business generating partners from throughout Virginia with his mantra of “mutual trust and respect.” A primary selling point was a transparent, open compensation system. “It had one of the most appealing and novel approaches to compensation, called the ‘consensus exercise,’ where all of the equity partners essentially took the total compensation budget, calculated by Gary, and submitted their own charts as to how it should be divided amongst the various partners.” While not binding, this open forum for discussion made sure every equity partner felt heard, and understood why final compensation decisions were made.

Another former partner, John Fitzpatrick, referred to the LeClairRyan of the 90s as a “true meritocracy,” one where the people who produced got rewarded for their effort, far better than they would have at older firms that were more interested in maintaining the older partners’ salaries.

The tech bubble collapse of 2001 was what first put those ideals to the test. Both Gary LeClair and the firm he built relied heavily on servicing entrepreneurial tech companies. LeClair’s book was reportedly decimated, seemingly overnight, and the firm’s financial bedrock was shaken. Firm lawyers, including LeClair, who once commanded top-tier compensation, faced a far more uncertain future.

In response, the old open-compensation system was progressively closed, and compensation decisions were increasingly vested in the hands of LeClair and his compensation committee. Per Nagle, “we went from a real meritocracy, where compensation was based on full disclosure of numbers, to a system that, by the time I left, had evolved where there was very little input from anyone beyond the core leadership group, and there was very little tolerance for dissent or desire for disclosure.”

With decisions now made behind closed doors, the mutual trust LeClairRyan was built on started to erode. A perception began to arise that LeClair and his favored lieutenants were keeping their salaries buoyed by the profits of more productive partners. Not only did the move toward a functionally closed system make lawyers, who are skeptical by nature, concerned about what was happening with compensation, but it seems that it contributed to driving away lawyers and practices that were profit centers for the firm. When rainmakers don’t see the benefits of their own hard work and growth, they become poised to leave for a new firm more willing to pay them what they’re worth. LeClairRyan found itself vulnerable to the same poaching of profitable attorneys it had been so successful at just a few years earlier.

The Band-Aid of Growth

Rather than make the hard choices such as cutting unproductive partners’ salaries (or his own), LeClair instead made a play for growth. In the short term, the plan was to take in existing practices, bringing in new profit centers to shore up declining profits elsewhere. In the long term, the hope was to expand the firm’s national footprint and top-line numbers to entice a fat corporate buyout once state bars began to allow non-attorney ownership of law firms.

The long-term plan fizzled when the predicted sea change in legal ethics rules [never came to pass](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/leclairryan-mistiming-the-end-of-the-legal-monopoly/). But the short-term effects of this rapid expansion were also more detrimental than helpful. LeClairRyan expanded aggressively, bringing in small practices with questionable profitability on guaranteed, multi-year salary contracts. Small offices are notoriously expensive, and rarely benefit from the economies of scale that larger law firm satellites enjoy. LeClairRyan’s top line kept expanding, as did Gary LeClair’s empire, but expenses kept pace, and in some cases exceeded the new revenue brought in.

In the last few years, it appears LeClairRyan found itself chasing endless cash infusions to cover the losses its prior decisions had wrought. The ill-fated preferred stock plan, discussed in my [last column](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/leclairryan-mistiming-the-end-of-the-legal-monopoly/), kept funds flowing for a while on the promise of a big payout once the firm was bought out. LeClairRyan received a $20M cash injection when it announced its partnership with alternative legal services provider UnitedLex, [which I profiled previously](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/unitedlex-luthor/). That partnership is now listed as being owed $8M plus interest in LeClairRyan’s bankruptcy schedules.

I don’t believe Gary LeClair set out with anything but the best of intentions in mind. But by the end of the road, LeClairRyan stumbled into being both the perpetrator and the victim of an inadvertent Ponzi scheme. It made bad decisions that cut into its profits, and so made more bad decisions to bring in new sources of funding to cover the shortfall. Then it needed more funding to replace the new funding it brought in, and on, and on, until the company had grown itself into a sudden and thunderous collapse.

Why This Matters

These past few pieces have been close to my heart. I manage a law firm that, up until a few weeks ago, I would have considered a peer of LeClairRyan. I needed to understand why and how such a seemingly forward-thinking firm, one that in some respects seemed to be a model of the forward thinking and experimentation that I champion, could go so wrong so quickly.

While we’ve only gotten a glimpse of the problems LeClairRyan faced, it’s apparent now that their biggest enemy was ignoring an unsustainable present by hoping for a possible future. A firm that doesn’t compensate and retain its dollar-producing partners isn’t going to last. Accurately valuing and pricing the contributions, both monetary and intangible, of each partner is more crucial than ever in a legal market poised for further contraction and more ruthless competition. Similarly, a firm needs confidence in the good faith of its leadership, and leaders need to earn that over time. A partnership needs to know that its leaders will make the tough choices — even when those choices are unpopular or difficult. Some decisions have to be made behind closed doors. When those decisions spawn fear and skepticism, rather than trust, nothing good can or will follow.

LeClairRyan forgot the lessons it built itself on, and died as a result. The only question remaining is how many of us left behind will learn from this collapse, and how many will continue marching proudly toward catastrophe.

Huzzah! It’s that time of year when attention is finally paid to how mid-level associates (defined as 3rd, 4th and 5th years) are feeling about their Biglaw firms. That’s right, it’s time for the results of the latest Am Law Mid-Level Survey.

The survey was completed by more than 5,000 associates at Am Law 200 and Global 100 firms. They rank their firms from 1-5 (1 being very dissatisfied, 5 being very satisfied) in the areas of: interest and satisfaction; levels of work; benefits and compensation; relations between associates and between partners and associates; training and guidance; management openness about firm strategies and partnership chances; the firm’s attitude toward pro bono work; its billable hours policy; and the likelihood of the associate being at the firm in two years.

So without any further ado, here at the Top 10 Biglaw firms in associate satisfaction:

- Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft
- Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy
- Akin Gump
- Gibson Dunn
- Blank Rome
- Sherman & Sterling
One of the biggest stories behind the numbers is that the new #1 firm, Schulte, has had a meteoric rise — it placed 78th in mid-level satisfaction just two years ago. Leadership at the firm saw that dismal 78th ranking and [decided to do something about it](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2018/08/26/how-schulte-roth-gave-associate-life-an-extreme-makeover/):

“It was a big billboard saying, ‘You should look and see if you can do this better,’” says partner Dan Kusnetz, who co-leads the firm’s associate committee. “We had let the gardens go unpruned and untended because of the crush of work and the financial crisis.”

The firm focused on seven areas according to Kusnetz: mentoring; caregiver leave; business development resources; training; informal networking; technology; and general “things that make life easier.” And the firm put its money where its mouth is — according to Alissa Golden, director of professional development and recruiting, saying “a great deal of financial resources have been dedicated to this.”

For those that are less than satisfied at their firm, a big problem at several firms is the lack of transparency, as anonymous comments from the survey reveal:

“Transparency goes a long way toward quelling associate anxiety.”

“It seems that the junior and midlevel associates often don’t know what is truly expected of them, whether they are meeting expectations, and how well they are performing at the firm.”

“Trust that your associates can handle the sausage-making process of the firm and be forthcoming with details about decisions and transparent with the reasons behind policies and firm actions.”

And of course that [age-old Biglaw dilemma](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/biglaw-firm-makes-big-joke-out-of-worklife-balance/) — work/life balance — also received some biting commentary:

“Saying that Big Law might not be a good fit for an individual who desires true work-life balance just won’t cut it anymore… Individuals who have self-respect and self-love tend to quit as a result of lack of work-life balance and eventually depart the firm.”

But it should be noted, very few associates surveyed were [actively considering](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/08/26/midlevel-associates-are-content-but-curious-about-their-futures/) leaving their firms:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Only 5.1 percent of midlevels said they are currently seeking a new job. Another 49 percent said while they are not actively looking, they would consider an optimal opportunity. Asked why they might consider leaving their current firm, work-life balance was the overwhelming leader, with more than half of respondents saying that was their main motivator. Other popular reasons for a potential departure were: making a geographic change; not making partner; pursuing higher earnings; and entering public service.

That said, the survey was completed before the [wave of Biglaw raises this summer](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2018-associate-salary-increase/), which left[ some associates out in the cold.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/if-firms-dont-think-recruiters-will-go-after-them-for-not-raising-salaries-theyre-wrong-this-email-proves-it/&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1535570250867000&usg=AFQjCNHYY0S7ei_WEC4V_5v8oZz6tvxCLA)

With each new day comes another Biglaw firm that’s trying to tread water amid the coronavirus crisis that threatens to drown the legal industry as we know it.

Today, we have news on yet another Biglaw firm that’s taking steps to make sure it doesn’t have to resort to furloughs and layoffs further down the line. Fragomen, with $637,286,000 in gross revenue in 2018, found itself at #62 in the latest Am Law 100 rankings, but that isn’t stopping the firm from instituting numerous cost-cutting measures.

In a memo sent yesterday that was addressed to employees worldwide (available in full on the next page), the firm’s executive committee noted that there will be salary reductions for all partners and senior, C-suite corporate leaders, effective May 1. The extent of those cuts was not published. In addition to the firm’s partner pay decision, employees discovered that they will not receive bonuses or salary increases in 2020. Decisions on pay raises and bonuses will be deferred until the end of the year, and any raises will not be effective until 2021. The firm has suspended its 401(k) matching program. The members of Fragomen’s executive committee say they’re taking these steps to avoid widespread furloughs and layoffs — but don’t get too comfortable, because furloughs and layoffs may still be necessary in the future.

We reached out to Fragomen for comment, but have yet to hear back.

(Flip to the next page to read Fragomen’s memo in full.)

If you’re a Biglaw associate in the fall of 2022, two things are probably true: (i) you’re hearing rumors of stealth layoffs (yikes!) and hoping you’re not going to be out of a job soon, and (ii) you’re eagerly awaiting news of your bonus, which may be right around the corner.

To kick off our coverage, we’re asking you to take this (always) confidential, (always) brief survey to share your thoughts on the upcoming bonus season. And if you’d like to stay on top of any changes this bonus season, enter your email below to sign up for our free bonus alerts.

[](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bmvMVz9iEuwghpA)

And as a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish — including, of course, the first such announcement.

[Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/) is a senior editor at Above the Law, where she’s worked since 2011. She’d love to hear from you, so please feel free to [email](mailto:staci@abovethelaw.com) her with any tips, questions, comments, or critiques. You can follow her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stacizaretsky) or connect with her on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/staci-zaretsky).

# It's Like Jones Day Doesn't Even Understand The Concept Of Optics

Jones Day (Photo by David Lat)

They are attacking two highly accomplished lawyers; it’s hard to believe that they aren’t excellent lawyers. It takes courage to bring this kind of lawsuit… To me, it’s clear that Jones Day has an illegal policy, and it’s a straightforward legal question….

I was surprised that they would be that aggressive. I sue a lot of companies and most are sensitive to optics….

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This is on the higher scale of personal attacks, and it’s pretty rare. Most firms don’t do this kind of vitriolic attack on their former all-stars. Most would handle it discreetly because it can hurt recruiting.

I’d think twice about joining this kind of law firm.

— Peter Romer-Friedman, counsel at Outten & Golden, [speaking to Vivia Chen of the Careerist](https://www.law.com/2019/08/26/jones-day-smears-its-prized-hires-smart-tactic/) about Jones Day’s PR tactics following the latest associate lawsuit against the firm. In [the lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/lawsuit-alleges-jones-day-doctored-firm-picture-to-make-attorney-look-more-caucasian/?rf=1) former associates Julia Sheketoff and Mark Savignac allege the firm’s non-gender neutral parental leave policy is discriminatory, the firm’s black box compensation system results in unequal pay, and the firm has a practice of altering firm photos to make their women attorneys more “attractive,” which manifests itself in making them look more white. The firm’s [response to the suit](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/new-discrimination-lawsuit-against-jones-day-is-already-getting-messy/) has been a full out attack of Sheketoff and Savignac, who were highly sought after Supreme Court clerks when they joined the firm. No word — yet — on how/if this strategy will impact the firm’s ability to lure more prestigious SCOTUS clerks to their ranks.

“And blame postmodern things I can’t relate / Like summer camp in coastal states / Like alcohol and coffee beans / Dance floors and magazines / I think it’s safe to say I’ve only got myself to blame.” — [The Format](https://genius.com/3906757)

This week, I had the opportunity to catch up with [Helen Wan ](http://helenwan.com/)— an author, lawyer, and speaker on DEI and women in the workplace.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Wan is a graduate of [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu/alumni/learn/bookclub/pastfeatures/2013-features/november2013/review) and [The University of Virginia School of Law](https://www.law.virginia.edu/uvalawyer/article/change-agents-5-best-selling-authors). Wan’s novel, “[The Partner Track](http://www.helenwan.com/the-book/),” follows idealistic young lawyer Ingrid (played in the series by [Arden Cho](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/partner-track-arden-cho-interview)) as she competes to climb the partner track at a New York law firm, premiered as an original Netflix series [last month](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/partner-track-book-vs-show).

I’ve covered the lack of diversity in the media time and time again (see [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/framing-the-grammys-education-and-biglaw-with-a-racial-equity-lens/), [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/what-do-the-oscars-and-the-legal-profession-have-in-common/), and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/without-significant-changes-diversity-in-the-legal-profession-will-remain-on-life-support/)), so I won’t digress on how critical [representation](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/started-from-the-bottom-now-were-here-minorities-in-the-legal-profession/) is to our [industry specifically](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/the-case-for-crazy-rich-asians-and-aapi-representation-in-the-legal-profession/) and [society as a whole](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/one-year-after-the-atlanta-aapi-shooting-aapi-women-are-being-hunted-in-the-streets/).

Wan’s story from the launch of her book to the landing of an original Netflix series is a testament to her hard work, grit, and the realization of dreaming big. It was incredible to learn about the rocket ship and roller coaster (rocket-coaster) trajectory of “The Partnership Track” as well as the trials and tribulations she’s faced throughout her career.

After speaking with Wan, I couldn’t help but want to write my own story. And I believe you will too after hearing more about her journey of bringing her novel to our television screens. Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Renwei Chung: You started writing “The Partner Track” 23 years ago, it was published in September 2013, and premiered on Netflix as an original TV series last month. Can you believe it?

Helen Wan: This has been a thrilling roller coaster ride. To be honest, I still wake up some mornings not quite believing any of it. It’s very much a Cinderella-at-the-ball feeling.

RC: Can you discuss the process of bringing the book to life on our living room screens?

HW: Sure, how much time ya got? Ha. It only took me 23 years from the day I originally took pen to paper, on my subway commute to and from work, to seeing these Parsons Valentine lawyers live and breathe on my TV. There were so many stops and starts along the way.

Even when an author is lucky enough to have a work published, let alone optioned, all the stars must align to end up with a TV series! And they didn’t, at least not for a long time.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
By the morning I received the astounding news from my agent: “Hi! Are you sitting down? I believe Netflix wants to make a show out of your book!” I had honestly almost written off the possibility. I’d never truly imagined all of the stars aligning the way they did, for this to happen.

So when I finally curled up and binge-watched all 10 episodes of the show one recent weekend, it was magical. It was the kind of smart, sexy, savvy show that, if I’d just randomly stumbled upon it one night while looking for something new to watch, I would honestly have loved it then, too. And that was a happy thing to find out.

RC: What was your inspiration for the epigraph by Ruth Bader Ginsburg: “I would not like to be the only woman on the Court.”

HW: Oh, I’ve always loved that quote from the Notorious RBG. Her life and legal career already made her a role model. But that epigraph is meaningful to me for another reason.

I dedicated “The Partner Track” in memory of my grandmother, An Ching Chun, who was 14 years older than RBG. Both of them were amazing, incredibly intelligent, resilient women who inspired me.

Through circumstance, one of them fled the Chinese Communist Revolution as a very young mother and ultimately landed as a stranger in Mei Guo (literally translated: the “Beautiful Country”) and the other ultimately became a Supreme Court Justice of the United States. I like to write a lot about timing and circumstance, and how they impact life outcomes.

RC: It is still so rare to see an AAPI woman protagonist on television or at the movies. How can we ensure more of these stories are told in Hollywood and the media in general?

HW: That one’s easy. One must walk the walk AND talk the talk. Meaning, if you really love something, and you believe it’s a story worth telling, and you wish there were more stories like it out there, getting in front of eyeballs, then you gotta put your money where your mouth is.

Watch the show. Buy the book. Go see the play or movie. And tell all your friends and neighbors! I know it’s not popular to say this, but the truth is, making art IS also a business.

RC: You mentioned the 1988 film “[Working Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_Girl)” as a strong influence on some of the themes in “The Partner Track.” Can you elaborate?

HW: Oh, I could go on all day about that brilliant movie! Talk about a dream team of director Mike Nichols (who also directed another of my favorite films, ‘The Graduate”), Melanie Griffith, Sigourney Weaver, Harrison Ford, Joan Cusack, and the list goes on. Actually, I just rewatched it recently. Almost 35 years later, it still strikes such a cultural chord.

I think everyone loves a great Cinderella story, especially when our hero is so believably flawed and vulnerable, and underestimated. I mean, who wants to read (or write!) about a perfect person, who never makes mistakes? Boring!

That end scene, when Tess meets her new assistant, goes into her new office, takes a giddy first spin in her swivel chair, and that gorgeous Carly Simon song swells and the camera breezes out to a view of the whole city, still gets me. Every single time. That movie is also a cinematic valentine to New York City, which I love.

RC: You read a snippet of the summer outing scene during [your interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7HnYlYFlaw) with [Sunni Yuen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunni-yuen-25018511/), a member of Google’s Legal Department back in January 2014. It is featured in [Episode 5 “Out of Office”](https://www.thereviewgeek.com/partnertrack-s1e5review/) — how did it feel to witness this scene on the television screen?

HW: The firm retreat was my favorite chapter to write, and now it’s my favorite episode of the show (Episode 5: “Out of Office”). I watched it and, literally, I laughed, I cried, it was better than “Cats.” I picked up the remote and rewatched it immediately. Then I called Georgia (Lee) to tell her how much I loved it.

I still find myself humming that beautiful Lake Scene song when Rachel and Justin are stranded on the water. It’s called [“Around Here,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx3Eznj7P8U) by a really talented singer-songwriter named Matt Holubowski, and I think his music adds perfect context to that setting.

RC: I noted three references to Above the Law in your book, as well as three references to Audrey Hepburn. How well do you think the Netflix series captures the book’s legal culture and fashion influences and references?

HW: I was impressed with the way this show takes a book about a law firm and makes it an entertaining “TV SHOW!!!” Yet it still captures the thornier themes and topics I tried to address with my novel. I think it’s a fairly successful combination of “Hollywood entertainment” and verisimilitude.

It is, after all, a TV series that seeks to entertain and enlighten. And who wants to watch a “100% authentic” show about, say, me drafting an asset purchase agreement at 2 A.M. at my desk, eating takeout in my gray college sweats? I mean, I personally think that would be a really, really boring TV show. Haha.

RC: I’ve heard many law schools and professors leverage last month’s series premiere of “[The Partner Track](https://www.netflix.com/title/81140282),” based on a book published almost a decade ago, to teach current lessons to this year’s 1Ls and other legal cohorts. Why do you think “The Partner Track” has struck such a chord in the legal community?

HW: Yes, I’m hearing from a lot of law profs and law partners and just people in general who tell me my novel may have been a bit “ahead of its time.”

I think what they mean is, we’re clearly at a different cultural moment right now, a critical moment when many more people are willing to both read and listen to and talk about stories like Ingrid’s. And Tyler’s. And even Murph’s. And I hope we’ll get a chance to continue telling these stories! There’s a lot more story to tell.

RC: Of course, I must bring up the [A.1. Sauce scene](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/3-summer-books-for-incoming-law-students/)! Are you getting as much response to it nowadays as you did when the book was published?

HW: Yes, I definitely hear from a lot of readers, and now TV viewers, for whom that A.1. Sauce scene resonates. And I don’t just mean lawyers and law students.

I think everyone has their own A.1. Sauce Moment at some point in their lives, right? I don’t know anyone who hasn’t felt like the “Outsider” in one way or another. Not even, dare I say it, Dan Fallon!

RC: Any advice for someone wanting to balance a legal career with a creative side hustle?

HW: Never assume it’s impossible. If you truly believe in the project, don’t give up. I’m glad I didn’t.

# Biglaw Partner Runs Face First Into Contempt Order
## Fun fact: The judge wasn't pleased.

The facts here are pretty straightforward. Baker Donelson partner Jon Seawright and senior public policy advisor Brent Alexander set themselves up a little investment fund. Then they invested in a hundred-million-dollar Ponzi scheme because, well, accidents happen. As judges are wont to do in these situations, the judge put a hold on any individual victim trying to carve back money in lieu of allowing a receiver to get the maximum recovery for all victims.

Then Seawright and Alexander went out and tried to recover some money. You can imagine where it goes from here.

Judge Carlton W. Reeves felt that ignoring his order was a bit contemptuous and benchslapped the pair. The remedy is still to be determined in subsequent hearings.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
While one might have expected an audience of attorneys — especially attorneys sophisticated enough to be invested in a hundred-million-dollar Ponzi scheme — to understand the concept of a receivership, Judge Reeves decided he needed to put the law in the simplest possible terms for even the dullest tools in the shed. And, in so doing, pretty much guarantees he’ll be the go-to citation in at least one filing in every receivership matter from now on:

In the simplest terms, the Order positions the Receiver as if she was the first person in line to board a Southwest Airlines flight, where there is limited capacity and there are no reserved seats. If someone cuts in front of the Receiver, her choices become more limited. The Order also prevents victims from jostling for a position closer to the front of the line.

This isn’t the first time Judge Reeves has offered a [devastatingly blunt rebuke](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/no-that-is-not-how-religious-freedom-works-at-all/). Maybe one of these days, people will stop going out of their way to annoy him.

In an increasingly digital world, cybersecurity for the information and data that law firms and other counsel are entrusted with is more important than ever. Complex passwords, multi-factor authentication, and firewalls are essential defense mechanisms, but they often fail to address a significant risk vector: the employee, an insider. Optiv defines insider risk as “the potential for an employee or other person with legitimate system and data access to negatively impact an organization’s people, data, or resources” ([Insider Risk | Optiv](https://www.optiv.com/cybersecurity-dictionary/insider-risk)). 

Ponemon Institute’s 2023 Cost of Insider Risks Global Report ([Ponemon Cost of Insider Risks Global Report – DTEX Systems Inc](https://www.dtexsystems.com/resource-ponemon-insider-risks-global-report/?&utm_campaign=Insider%20Threat-PS-Google-Q124-2023%20Ponemon%20Cost%20of%20Insider%20R&utm_medium=Paid%20Search&utm_source=bing&Latest_Campaign=701Ql000000pYJ8&Latest_Campaign_Status=Converted&Last_Touch_Campaign_ID=7013a000002hmSr&Last_Touch_Campaign_Status=Clicked&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=na_search_ponomen&utm_keyword=ponemon%20institute%20report&msclkid=9baabe82e060135722a2d89e6ab034a4)) notes that the costs of insider risk are at an unprecedented high. In 2023, the average annual cost of a data breach from insider risk was $16.2 million per organization, up from $15.4 million in 2022. Typically, these data breaches take about three months to contain. Moreover, the 2023 report revealed that the most significant costs of insider-related data breaches are accrued after the incident occurs due to containment and remediation efforts. 

While insider risk can never be eliminated, it can be reduced through technical and non-technical controls and by leveraging employee engagement.

Insider Risk Explained 

When exploring how to reduce insider risk, it is vital to understand the differences between unintentional insider risk and intentional insider risk. Organizations experience harm from unintentional insider risk when an employee or another person closely associated with the organization is negligent or becomes complacent when handling data. Careless insiders can compromise data security by losing a laptop with unencrypted data, sharing a password with an unauthorized individual, clicking links in a suspicious email, or any other negligent act where due regard for data security is not observed. Complacency can also contribute to unintended data loss when insiders fail to follow proper security protocols, such as not updating applications and operating systems, dating applications and operating systems, using or reusing weak passwords, or not following data deletion best practices. In 2023, these non-malicious insiders accounted for 75% of all insider risk incidents ([Ponemon Cost of Insider Risks Global Report – DTEX Systems Inc,](https://www.dtexsystems.com/resource-ponemon-insider-risks-global-report/?&utm_campaign=Insider%20Threat-PS-Google-Q124-2023%20Ponemon%20Cost%20of%20Insider%20R&utm_medium=Paid%20Search&utm_source=bing&Latest_Campaign=701Ql000000pYJ8&Latest_Campaign_Status=Converted&Last_Touch_Campaign_ID=7013a000002hmSr&Last_Touch_Campaign_Status=Clicked&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=na_search_ponomen&utm_keyword=ponemon%20cost%20of%20insider%20risk&msclkid=f2d826536b0c19626f794075afa6b86c) p. 5). 

Intentional or malicious insider risk incidents involve individuals who work in an organization and deliberately seek to cause financial or reputational harm to that organization. These events can be organized into several categories: espionage or intellectual property theft, intentional unauthorized disclosure, sabotage, fraud, and workplace violence ([Insider Types | MITRE Insider Threat Research & Solutions](https://insiderthreat.mitre.org/insider-types/)). Of these, one of the most concerning and one that must be addressed and hopefully prevented with employee engagement is insider workplace violence. The UK National Protective Security Authority defines this to include “any action or threat of physical violence, harassment, sexual harassment, intimidation, bullying or other threatening behavior by a co-worker in the workplace.” As one could imagine, an intentional breach by an insider would be the costliest. While less frequent, the average cost per incident topped $700,000 in 2023 ([Ponemon Cost of Insider Risks Global Report – DTEX Systems Inc, p. 9)](https://www.dtexsystems.com/resource-ponemon-insider-risks-global-report/?&utm_campaign=Insider%20Threat-PS-Google-Q124-2023%20Ponemon%20Cost%20of%20Insider%20R&utm_medium=Paid%20Search&utm_source=bing&Latest_Campaign=701Ql000000pYJ8&Latest_Campaign_Status=Converted&Last_Touch_Campaign_ID=7013a000002hmSr&Last_Touch_Campaign_Status=Clicked&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=na_search_ponomen&utm_keyword=ponemon%20cost%20of%20insider%20risk&msclkid=f2d826536b0c19626f794075afa6b86c).

Technical controls are one mitigating step an organization can take to reduce the risk of insider threats. Detective controls, like auditing, provide accountability for privileged and regular users alike while offering the ability to monitor for unusual behavior of users that may indicate attempts at data exfiltration, data smuggling, and unwanted system modification. Preventative controls work together with detective controls to reduce the load on analysts and disrupt known malicious behaviors. These controls include proper account provisioning and de-provisioning, minding least-privilege access management best practices, separating duties for critical system changes, and having strict remote access controls. Finally, if a malicious act is performed, corrective controls, such as data backups, can restore systems to functioning and allow the organization to return to normal operations. 

Detective controls are an essential type of control that organizations can use to alert an organization of the first signs of suspicious activity and be used as evidence when a suspicious activity occurs. Auditing and alerting network logs allow organizations to detect anomalies in user data upload and download rates; compared with regular user activity, these anomalies can indicate data exfiltration outside the company network or data smuggling. CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) notes explicitly that User Behavior Analytics (UBA) software can be used to help identify these anomalies and quickly alert analysts of unusual user behavior ([Insider Threat Mitigation Guide (cisa.gov)](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Insider%20Threat%20Mitigation%20Guide_Final_508.pdf), p.39). Host-based actions should also be logged and reviewed regularly, especially for mission-critical systems, as not all illicit actions are conducted via network communications ([Common Sense Guide to Mitigating Insider Threats, Seventh Edition (cmu.edu)](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/library/common-sense-guide-to-mitigating-insider-threats-seventh-edition/), p. 83-4). 

Logs outside of business hours should also be investigated to determine the actions taken, purpose, and validity of the events, as a user may be attempting to hide malicious activity during minimally reviewed times. Preventative controls assist in auditing and mitigating insider threats by preventing malicious actions from taking place. When provisioning user accounts, least privilege permissions should be utilized to ensure that users only have access to systems and applications required for their job duties. Consequently, a thorough and reliable user de-provisioning process should be established to ensure that when a user departs from the organization, access to previous systems and account passwords are removed or changed so that the user can no longer access company resources. While minimal privileges can prevent significant, organization-wide changes, logical controls that require multiple users to authorize mission-critical system changes should also be used where possible ([Common Sense Guide to Mitigating Insider Threats, Seventh Edition (cmu.edu),](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/library/common-sense-guide-to-mitigating-insider-threats-seventh-edition/) p. 79[).](https://www.dtexsystems.com/resource-ponemon-insider-risks-global-report/?&utm_campaign=Insider%20Threat-PS-Google-Q124-2023%20Ponemon%20Cost%20of%20Insider%20R&utm_medium=Paid%20Search&utm_source=bing&Latest_Campaign=701Ql000000pYJ8&Latest_Campaign_Status=Converted&Last_Touch_Campaign_ID=7013a000002hmSr&Last_Touch_Campaign_Status=Clicked&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=na_search_ponomen&utm_keyword=ponemon%20cost%20of%20insider%20risk&msclkid=f2d826536b0c19626f794075afa6b86c) 

Finally, although mitigations may be in place to reduce risk, in the event of a threat actor causing damage to an organization’s systems, corrective controls such as data backups, configuration backups, and rollback plans should be utilized to return systems to normal operations. These backups and rollback plans should be tested regularly, as a backup plan should be considered not yet implemented until testing of the plan has been completed, noting mean time to recovery and mean time to resolve.

While technical measures are essential for safeguarding against insider threats, nontechnical approaches also play a crucial role in mitigating these risks within legal firms and corporate legal departments. Non-technical strategies can reduce insider risk by increasing positive reinforcement and incentives and reducing negative environmental factors. 

Creating a positive work environment is paramount in reducing insider risk. Employees who feel valued, respected, and satisfied in their roles are more invested in the organization’s success and less likely to engage in risky behavior that could compromise security. By fostering a culture of trust, transparency, and collaboration, organizations cultivate a sense of loyalty and commitment among employees and a culture of shared responsibility for information security. 

A sense of belonging and camaraderie among employees strengthens their commitment to upholding ethical standards and protecting sensitive information. Resentment and discontent can significantly increase the risk of insider threats. Organizations must address any underlying issues promptly and effectively. Addressing these issues may involve implementing conflict resolution mechanisms, providing channels for employees to voice their concerns, and addressing grievances fairly and transparently. By promoting a culture of fairness and respect, organizations can reduce the risk of insider threats from internal dissatisfaction or disgruntlement. 

Employees who feel valued and see a future with the company are less likely to engage in risky behavior that could jeopardize their careers. Organizations should provide opportunities for career advancement and invest in employees’ professional development. Continuous education and training are essential to any effective insider risk mitigation strategy. Organizations should provide regular security awareness training to all employees, highlighting the importance of confidentiality, data protection, and best practices for safeguarding sensitive information. By keeping employees informed about emerging threats and reinforcing security protocols, organizations empower them to be vigilant and proactive in identifying and mitigating insider risks. Employees should be educated on the potential consequences of their actions and the value of protecting proprietary information. 

Regular communication reinforces the importance of information security and keeps it at the forefront of employees’ minds. Organizations should ensure employees understand what constitutes acceptable behavior regarding handling sensitive data and proprietary information and that information security policies and procedures are clearly communicated to all employees. Employees should be informed about security updates, best practices, and any changes in policies or procedures ([SP 800-53 Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations | CSRC (nist.gov)](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final), PS-1, Policies and Procedures). 

Creating a culture where employees feel comfortable reporting suspicious activities or security concerns without fear of retaliation is essential. Such a culture can be developed by acknowledging and rewarding employees who demonstrate a commitment to information security, recognizing individuals who report security incidents or implement security best practices in their daily work, and implementing anonymous reporting mechanisms to provide employees with a safe way to voice their concerns. 

One of the best ways to reduce insider risk is to eliminate the risk before it can materialize. Implementing thorough background checks and vetting procedures during hiring should be standard practice for most organizations. Organizations can identify potential red flags early on by conducting comprehensive screenings, including criminal background checks, reference verifications, and employment history checks. Verifying educational and professional credentials helps ensure that employees possess the qualifications and integrity for handling sensitive legal matters. Similarly, exit interviews and offboarding procedures offer a last chance to prevent data loss. Organizations should conduct thorough exit interviews and ask departing employees to sign, confirming no company files are being taken. Additionally, offboarding procedures should ensure that all access to sensitive information is revoked promptly. This process helps to mitigate the risk that former employees may still have access to company systems or data after their employment has concluded ([SP 800-53 Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations | CSRC (nist.gov),](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final) Personnel Screening and Personnel Termination). 

Conclusion 

Both technical and non-technical measures are vital for reducing insider risk in the legal industry and play a crucial role in fostering a culture of security awareness to minimize the likelihood of security breaches. Law firms and corporate legal departments can effectively mitigate insider risk and safeguard sensitive information by implementing adequate technical controls, promoting a positive work environment, addressing resentment and discontent, and strengthening employee engagement.

# Being A Summer Associate Is The Best Job You'll Have In The Legal Industry
## It's basically like sleepaway camp, but you get paid insanely well and the food is a lot better.

Ah, the end of a semester (again, for those of you who are experiencing/have experienced a quarters system . . . surely those have to end at some point too, right?).  Student traffic into my office slows to a trickle, as, for that matter, does foot traffic in the hallways of the law school as those studying for exams seemingly beam themselves directly into and out of the library for 12-hour rotations.  While many of you are focused on your upcoming exams, a good number likely have one eye looking forward to this summer.  This is especially true for those finishing off 2L.  My first column here at Above the Law dealt with 1L summer, and while that was only a month ago, with the speed of the news cycles in 2018, that column might as well have been 15 years ago.  So let us talk about the summer once again, this time from the perspective of those of you about to embark on perhaps the best part of the law school experience, the 2L summer.  Regardless of whether you spend the summer after your second year in Biglaw, a small firm, government, a non-profit, or elsewhere, there are some things to consider.

First, try a bit of everything. Even if you’ve wanted to be a litigator since grade school, influenced by reruns of Law & Order or Night Court ([RIP Judge Harry Stone](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/obituaries/harry-anderson-dead-night-court.html)), do not spend the entire summer merely writing motions.  Dip your toe into the transactional pool and see what it is like.  I am not saying that one deal will make the most ardent litigator-to-be want to suddenly become a master M&A practitioner, but just because you have always thought you wanted to be the next member of the SCOTUS bar does not mean that is where your innate talents lie, or even what you truly want to do once you have experienced the wide array of practice areas available.  Now, some Biglaw firms might assign you to a particular group, and some smaller firms/employers might only deal with a certain subset of the law, but even if you cannot work on an array of topics over the course of the summer, use the opportunity to at least familiarize yourself with other areas, either by talking to attorneys at your firm and getting a sense of what their practice is like or even arranging to chat with some attorneys outside of your employer.

How can you talk to attorneys who are not working in your office?  Once again, it is all about [networking](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/you-gotta-network-to-get-work-baby/).  While this is less important if you are in a job that will likely lead to a post-graduation offer, even in those circumstances it cannot hurt to have a few surreptitious conversations, just in case you find yourself at the end of a summer with an offer you have no intention of taking (yes, that can happen).  And if your summer position is unlikely to lead to an offer of permanent employment, networking over the summer is vital, especially if you will be working in the city where you would like to start your practice.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Next, do good work.  Look, I get it.  The paychecks (especially if you are in the $180K Biglaw salary bracket), the interesting cases, the opulent meals, it can be hard to treat your 2L summer like a job.  Believe me, it is.  While your employer clearly thinks you can excel there (if they did not, you would not have been hired in the first place), to say nothing of having invested a significant amount of money in you, the summer is still tantamount to one long job interview.  And while a Biglaw firm might be loathe to spend $30,000 on a student and then not give them an offer, they REALLY want to avoid investing $200,000 in a junior associate, only to determine the attorney cannot do the work.  One of the easy ways for an employer to determine your ability to stick with them for the long term is to look at your work product.  Put your best foot forward.  Do not submit drafts.  Everything you hand in, regardless of what you determine to be the import of the assignment, should be your best work.  I remember as a summer associate, I turned in a brief for a small appellate matter.  While it was not a bad brief, it was not A+ work.  What I thought would be a collaborative process with the supervising attorney to get a polished final brief was anything but.  The marked-up copy I got back was covered in more red than Jimmy saw on his tour of the slaughterhouse with Troy McClure.



But while you need to work hard, the final piece of advice for your 2L summer is to have fun. Being a summer associate is the best job you will likely have in the legal industry (trust me, I have had most of the jobs in this industry). Interesting assignments, partners and associates putting on their best face, no one caring about how many hours you are billing.  It is basically like sleepaway camp, but you get paid insanely well and the food is a lot better.  Friends you make that summer can last a lifetime.  The best man at my wedding was someone I met when we were summer associates.  When one of our fellow summers found themselves in the middle of a recent national news bonfire, stories flew back and forth via a group text among a handful of my summer associate colleagues, despite the fact that we haven’t worked together in nearly a decade.  This isn’t to say that you should not observe some limits.  The last thing you want to be is this year’s [Aquagirl](https://abovethelaw.com/aquagirl/) (and for every well-publicized story, there are dozens more than never go viral but are almost as bad and result in the same no offer; pro tip: DO NOT repeatedly slam a partner’s golf club on the fairway if you hit an errant shot).  And always be mindful of what the regular associates have to sacrifice to ensure you are having a good time.  While you might not have to keep track of your hours, those taking you out to lunch do and there is only so much “professional development” one can bill in a month, so try to keep the meal closer to 60 minutes than three hours.

So for those of you currently buried in the library, or if you just have memories of when you were, rest assured that there is a light at the proverbial tunnel, and it is not just the familiar glow of your laptop.  Power through your exams, celebrate, and then pack your bags for a great summer.

# Litigation Powerhouse Sends Associate Salaries To The Moon
## Salaries are soaring at this firm.

With Cravath officially on board, a gaggle of West Coast firms decided it was high time to join the 2021 compensation wars yesterday afternoon, and rushed to raise salaries. Quinn Emanuel was one of them. The litigation powerhouse brought home $1,301,077,000 gross revenue in 2020, and now the firm’s associates and of counsel will be able to share in that wealth through a Davis Polk match.

Here’s what the new salary scale looks like at the firm:

- 2021: $202,500
- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013: $365,000

# 2 Key Issues In COVID-19 Insurance Litigation So Far
## Understanding what the courts have ruled so far is key to formulating case strategies going forward.

As major catastrophic events always do, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major source of litigation. In fact, it’s already one of the largest waves of insurance coverage litigation in our nation’s history, and it’s only just getting started.

Since the pandemic fully set in and shut everything down in March 2020, the amount of litigation that has been filed is staggering. Over 2,100 lawsuits seeking coverage for pandemic-related business interruption have been filed in at least 44 states. This has generated more than 800 trial court decisions and nearly 20 appellate court decisions so far.

This is just the beginning.

The legal landscape surrounding COVID-19 insurance litigation will continue to be written for years to come. Thus far, however, two key issues have emerged that practitioners in this area need to understand:

- Insurers are asserting a number of exclusions to bar coverage for COVID-19 claims under all-risk policies, with varying degrees of success. Some of the most common that courts have been considering include virus exclusions, contamination exclusions, pollution exclusions, and more.
- Policy coverage for communicable disease might have much broader implications. Already courts have been tasked with deciding whether affirmative coverage for communicable disease is a recognition that communicable diseases can also cause physical loss or damage and whether claims for communicable disease are limited to the policies’ sublimits for communicable disease coverages or if they can unlock the policies’ larger limits for business interruption, among other things.
As COVID-19 insurance lawsuits continue to be filed at a notable pace, understanding what the courts have ruled so far is key to formulating case strategies going forward. 

To help you understand the current legal landscape in this area, PLI is offering a one-hour program, [COVID-19 Insurance Litigation: Key Exclusions and Communicable Disease Coverage](https://www.pli.edu/programs/covid-19-insurance-litigation--key-exclusions-and-communicable-disease-coverage?t=live?tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), which will provide valuable insight into the major trends in this area of litigation so far, and what those trends might mean for future lawsuits. Register today to stay ahead of the curve in this burgeoning area of law.

# Is This Really A Summer Associate Scandal?

[Summer associateships](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-is-it-like-to-practice-biglaw-in-the-summer/) are fraught with both opportunities to prove yourself and chances to royally screw up. You give law students a big salary, add in top-flight events and a healthy amount of alcohol, and just about anything can happen. And here at Above the Law we love a good summer associate scandal. Whether it is [slapping an associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/did-a-biglaw-lawyer-just-get-slapped-by-a-summer-associate/) or [jumping in the river](https://abovethelaw.com/2006/11/an-update-on-aquagirl-things-are-going-swimmingly/), we get all the gossip on the risqué goings-on.

Take, for example, a recent rumor making the rounds. We won’t name the firm or any of the parties, but it is a doozy. A Biglaw summer associate allegedly flashed folks at a summer event:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Though details are still few, I have to wonder if this is even really a scandal. Did this summer lift a shirt like it was Mardi Gras and cheap plastic beads are the only form of currency? That seems like a bold move, even assuming a generous amount of alcohol and an absence of f*cks to give.

The more one wonders about the way this all went down, the more questions there are. Perhaps it was less “Girls Gone Wild” and more about policing what a woman wears. For a woman, there are tons of hidden land mines in “dressing professionally.” Perhaps it was a shirt cut too low or a button that came undone; in the awkward “partying with your co-workers” environment, things can be misinterpreted. In the law firm equivalent of summer camp, rumors spread like wildfire and things get blown out of proportion.

Maybe a “talking to” is really the best move. Because even if they are messed-up, the impressions you make as a SA can follow you your whole career. Learning that lesson late is better than never.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firm Institutes Mandatory Work-From-Home Policy To Protect Personnel From Coronavirus
## When will other firms come to their senses and offer work-from-home solutions like this?

As America steps up its offense in the war against the coronavirus pandemic, Biglaw firms are now taking the threat of infection more seriously, offering employees a way to stay safe from harm through work-from-home policies. First came Quinn Emanuel, which [shuttered its New York office](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/quinn-emanuel-new-york-coronavirus/) after one of the firm’s partners tested positive for coronavirus, implementing a work-from-home period for all personnel. A day later, Faegre Drinker [closed its offices worldwide](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/faegre-drinker-worldwide-office-closure-coronavirus/), offering remote work access, if only for a short time, due to a coronavirus scare. Next, Weil Gotshal informed all of its employees that the firm had enacted [mandatory work-from-home sessions](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/prestigious-biglaw-firm-enacts-global-work-from-home-policy-over-coronavirus-concerns/) on alternating weeks.

Now, we’ve received word about a firm that’s gone all in when it comes to protecting its lawyers and staff. Which firm truly cares about employee health and safety?

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Reed Smith has instituted a mandatory work-from-home plan for all personnel in its U.S. and Europe & Middle East offices. Here’s an excerpt from the memo:

The Senior Management Team is directing that lawyers and professional staff across all of our US and EME offices work remotely starting Friday, March 13, 2020, and until further updates. Personnel are not to be in the office absent compelling and essential business need. If you believe such a need exists, please contact your Office Managing Partner, or his or her designee, to seek approval and to schedule and plan for that need. We will have in each location a team of essential employees available to assist with key business needs.

Obviously, containment is a critical component in stopping the spread of the virus, and this preventative step is intended for that purposes. This is a rapidly changing environment, and we anticipate that we will be operating under this remote-work policy for at least the next several weeks – and perhaps longer.

Kudos to Reed Smith for taking real steps to protect each and every one of its employees during these uncertain times. If only more firms were willing to offer absolute work-from-home accommodations, lawyers and staff wouldn’t have to worry about potentially getting infected with COVID-19.

# Where Can Associates Get The Biggest Bang For Their Biglaw Buck?
## Say goodbye to New York and a big howdy to Texas.

Cravath [raised associate pay](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) to great heights back in February 2022, with first- through eighth-year associates taking home healthy salaries ranging from $215,000 to $415,000. After more than a year of taking home these generous paychecks, you may be wondering how associates are doing when it comes to living their best lives. As it turns out, some associates are living much larger than others — and it’s all because of where they live.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/19/where-do-big-law-associates-live-the-largest/) recently compared the cost of living in 30 U.S. cities with the self-reported salaries of more than 1,500 third-year associates to determine where Biglaw associates can get the best bang for their buck. Here’s their methodology:

Using the nation’s highest cost-of-living region as our baseline—Manhattan, New York—we calculated the average base compensation reported by associates in 30 other U.S. cities. Then, we used Bankrate’s Cost of Living Comparison Calculator (which queries C2ER data) to find out how much an associate would need to make in those cities to maintain the lifestyle of someone making the current market rate of $250,000 as a third-year associate in Manhattan. The cost of living index factors in data points like housing, food, utilities, transportation, health care, and other goods and services.

Subtracting the latter figure from the average salaries, we arrived at an approximate surplus figure for each city—the money you’d have left over if you lived approximately the same lifestyle as a Manhattan associate, but in another city on that city’s average Big Law salary.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So, which cities are the best for Biglaw associates based on this calculation? Where can associates get the best combination of high compensation with a low cost of living?

Without further ado, these are the 10 cities where associates can stretch their salaries the furthest:

- Houston, TX: $143,256 surplus
- Charlotte, NC: $136,909 surplus
- Austin, TX: $136,683 surplus
- Hartford, CT: $133,826 surplus
- Baltimore, MD: $132,061 surplus
- Tampa, FL: $130,225 surplus
- Dallas, TX: $128,036 surplus
- Pittsburgh, PA: $127,004 surplus
- Atlanta, GA: $126,587 surplus
- Philadelphia, PA: $124,035 surplus

And what about the worst cities for Biglaw associates in terms of making their money work for them? Here’s more from [Am Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/19/where-do-big-law-associates-live-the-largest/):

Unsurprisingly, the West Coast and Northeast were the most expensive markets for cost of living—San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle followed Manhattan for cost of living and offered roughly the same compensation as cheaper cities like Philadelphia and Dallas.

Say sayonara to big East and West Coast cities and pack your bags, associates, because it looks like it may be time to move to Texas, the Southeast, or the Rust Belt to truly enjoy your bountiful Biglaw salaries.

# Associate Raises: A General Counsel And Managing Partner Webcast

2016 is the year of the great salary increase, in both Biglaw and leading boutiques. After nearly a decade of salary stagnation, Cravath set the new MoneyLaw standard in early June, and we’ve been keeping pace with the developments ever since then.

Most of the coverage at Above the Law has focused on the associates already ensconced in law firms’ warm (read: smothering) embrace. They want paper proof their firms respect them as much as Cravath does, otherwise they’ll be on the phone with recruiters.

But what do law firm leaders and their clients think about the pay raises? We previously discussed the salary increases with Professor Bill Henderson, one of the most astute observers of Biglaw in legal education. Now it’s time for the managing partner and general counsel perspective.

I will be moderating a panel featuring the following distinguished speakers:

- John Hueston, Partner at Hueston Hennigan LLP
- Arash Mostafavipour, EVP, General Counsel & Chief Compliance Officer at Xome
- Michael Allen, Founder and Managing Principal at Lateral Link
Please [join us](http://bit.ly/2b5UQRZ) this Thursday at 1:30 p.m. EST in this enlightening webcast, and follow along using the #MoneyLaw hashtag on Twitter.

You can [register](http://bit.ly/2b5UQRZ) [here](http://bit.ly/2b5UQRZ) for a reminder, but email is not required to watch live.

Thank you to [Lateral Link](http://bit.ly/2b4rW3j) for sponsoring what should be a fascinating discussion!

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Demand Justice Argues No Biglaw Attorneys Should Be Nominated To The Courts
## Reshaping the courts means promoting different kinds of experiences to the bench.

One of the advantages Republicans and the Federalist Society have when it comes to judicial appointments is that they have managed to turn their agenda-driven support of white supremacy into a guiding legal ideology. Originalism does a lot of work: it’s a form of indoctrination, it’s a purity test, it’s a euphemism, it’s a trap, and it’s a judicial outcome masquerading as a theory of mere interpretation. If Republicans were honest about the agenda behind originalism, people would reject it. If the Federalist Society admitted it was choosing judges solely on their willingness to retard the rights and equality of nonwhite people and women, they wouldn’t be treated as legitimate. But originalism functions like a long garment under which conservatives can smuggle in all sorts of nightmares.

The left has no counterpart. The left’s preference for viewing each case as an individual controversy, instead of some kind of ongoing ideological battle of Constitutional supremacy, defies the promotion of straight ideologues to the bench. Even when Democrats are in favor of pushing a specific ideology, the Democrats operate within a much wider ideological spectrum: a liberal ideologically committed to regulatory authority of the administrative state will fight a liberal ideologically committed to the advancement of civil rights, when those regulations are racist. There is no organizational fealty a progressive must pledge in order to be considered for a judicial opening. Democrats want to nominate “good” judges, whatever the hell that means. They don’t have to have a specific background, they don’t have to be indoctrinated by a specific group, they don’t have to have served their time in preferred positions, nobody cares about their race, color, or creed — they don’t even have to be particularly young.

Which is why Democrats fail. Conservatives strike the same racist and misogynist note, over and over again, while liberals are enamored by the diversity of the keyboard. Conservatives have a conniption when one of “theirs,” like John Roberts, doesn’t rule their way all the time, while liberals make excuses for Stephen Breyer. Republicans who do this work already know not only the next 10 people they want on the Supreme Court, but the next 10 people they want on every circuit court. Democrats… I mean if you asked the people running for the Democratic nomination right now who the next Democratic nominee should be to the Supreme Court, half of them would say “Merrick Garland,” and be surprised when progressive court watchers asked those candidates for their money back.

There is no liberal answer to the Federalist Society, there is no liberal answer to the Judicial Crisis Network; wealthy conservatives pour money into groups meant to win the courts for conservatives, while wealthy liberals pour money into their own presidential campaigns. There is no answer.

There have been lots of attempts to correct this losing asymmetry by groups of the left. Democratic politicians might be frustratingly unwilling to battle Republicans for the control of the courts, but groups like the American Constitution Society and Alliance for Justice have been trying to school politicians and the voting public about what a “good” judge should look like from the left. Today, [Demand Justice](https://www.demandjustice.org/) — a group started by former Clinton campaign national press secretary [Brian Fallon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fallon_(press_secretary)) — is out with a new proposal that offers an alternative way to pick liberal judicial nominees. Their guiding principle? No Biglaw partners.

From Fallon and Demand Justice’s co-founder, [Chris Kang](https://www.acslaw.org/person/christopher-kang/), in their op-ed in [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/no-more-corporate-judges/596383/):

Today the federal bench is wildly unrepresentative of the legal profession as a whole. Our organization—Demand Justice—has analyzed the professional backgrounds of all 175 circuit-court judges, who serve at the level just below the Supreme Court. It found that nearly 60 percent were once corporate-law partners.

This dynamic has created perverse professional incentives for young, progressive lawyers who possess even the slightest political ambitions. A career at a corporate firm already confers advantages in the form of wealth and social capital, but it has also become a politically safe way station for anyone nurturing hopes of a judicial appointment.

The next Democratic administration should make upending these professional incentives a priority. A career representing indigent defendants or working as a civil-rights lawyer at a public-interest organization should be an asset in progressive circles, not a liability. Republicans aggressively promote judicial nominees who have worked at right-wing advocacy organizations or who have advanced conservative causes, while Democrats unilaterally eschew the political fights that come with such picks. The next Democratic president must break this mold.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Focusing on a lawyer’s training is one way to do it, when imposing a universal ideology is not available. It is unquestionable that the Roberts’ Court has been the most “pro-business” Court of all time, with disastrous effects for worker’s rights and women’s rights. If you can’t say “we’re only going to support judges who support the rights of the underrepresented,” saying “we’re only going to support judges who haven’t made their careers by promoting the rights of the rich and powerful” feels like the next best thing.

I like this idea, way more than I would have a few years ago. Longtime readers of this blog know that somewhere deep inside of me lurks an unabashedly elitist prick. Prep school –> Ivy law school –> Biglaw –> circuit court appointment is a pathway that seemed not just standard, but more or less preferred to me, just a couple of years ago.

But… the Brett Kavanaugh fiasco did something to me. They hurt me. They changed me. They opened my eyes to a reality I was all too willing to overlook while ogling the gold-plated résumés of my peers. The reality is that legal elites will protect their own, no matter what, no matter the cost in blood and treasure to those who look to the courts as the first, last, and only chance at justice.

Long before Brett Kavanaugh was accused of attempted rape, [his defense of sexual harasser Alex Kozinski was known](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/did-brett-kavanaugh-know-about-alex-kozinski/). His argument that he didn’t know anything about Kozinski was a lie, and the legal elites were in the best possible position to call him out on that lie. In addition, he was a known political hack — his time working with Ken Starr alone proved that. And he perjured himself in front of Congress.

But elites from Ivy law professors to Biglaw attorneys defended him. Liberal elites. Oh sure, progressive elites “worried” about this absolute antipathy towards women and their reproductive rights, but they consistently told us that Kavanaugh was a “good guy.” Why? Because they went to an event with him and he didn’t shotgun a beer while playing a game of grab-ass? You didn’t need to believe that he tried to rape somebody (which I believe he did) to know that he was entirely unfit for the federal bench, much less the Supreme Court. The inability of powerful elites to see that is an indictment of the whole lot of them.

The entire culture of Biglaw and Ivy League education is how a guy like Brett Kavanaugh is allowed to happen. Telling all of these people that they have to sit on the sidelines for a term or two while we nominate judges who have not been doused by that culture seems like a fine start towards remaking the federal bench.

Now, there are some obvious problems with this approach. [NYU Law professor Melissa Murray](https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.overview&personid=40825) (who people should really listen to about all things), puts the obvious problem plainly:

Agree that we should be nominating PDs, public interest lawyers, etc. But an across the board prohibition on BigLaw partners/lawyers might limit the number of POC nominated. Off the top of my head, a number of judges of color who are currently on the bench [https://t.co/fPrXIPtxho](https://t.co/fPrXIPtxho)

— Melissa Murray (@ProfMMurray) [August 21, 2019](https://twitter.com/ProfMMurray/status/1164176127193206784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Professor Murray goes on to point out that right now, students of color are fielding Biglaw offers, high-paying jobs that they’ve worked their butts off for that are also the only way that they can pay off their huge debts from law school. Many of these people will be accused of “selling out” by their own community, when the reality is that law school is so expensive, the government does so little to help offset the costs, and people of color so rarely have “Mommy and Daddy” pay off their education, that Biglaw is not just the best offer, but the only reasonable one.

Trust me, I’ve been there. It would be hypocritical of me to tell students of color to do anything other than “take the money,” just because I figured out five seconds ago that the culture of elitism kind of sucks.

But, I think there are aspects of this Demand Justice proposal that answer some of Professor Murray’s entirely legitimate criticisms. For starters, Demand Justice is defining “corporate lawyers” as Biglaw partners, not associates. I do think that there is a legitimate distinction that can be drawn between young people who hop in to make some cash and pay some debts, versus established lawyers who use Biglaw as a piggy-bank every time their party is out of favor in Washington. It is the people who are always trying to keep themselves in the good graces of corporate law, in case they ever want to cash in their chips, that are the problem Demand Justice is trying to solve for.

As a second point, encouraging ambitious people who have the financial stability to not go into Biglaw, to not go into Biglaw, isn’t the worst thing in the world. You should be able to spend your entire career as a public defender, and still be considered for a judicial appointment. You shouldn’t feel like if you don’t get your Biglaw stamp that your career is permanently hobbled. Remember, we have a whole generation of potentially brilliant lawyers who were not able to get into Biglaw, because they came out of school during the last recession. And, not for nothing, but we’re on the cusp of having another one. Making sure we value these alternative professional experiences is an important goal.

I reached out to Professor Murrary for some non-Twitter thoughts about these issues. She said:

I do not disagree with the premise of this proposal: that we need a broader understanding of the experiences that make for a federal judge. But this seems less like a temporal re-calibration, and more of a categorical exclusion of a particular group of people from federal judicial service. While I would be delighted to see more public defenders and union lawyers on the judiciary, I would worry about a proposal that excludes from the judicial pipeline the appointment of women and people of color who happen to be partners at law firms.

She added: “People of color are not Biglaw partners because we all love the Chamber of Commerce.”

These critiques track with my own experience in Biglaw. I didn’t love my clients, I loved being able to afford to help my mother out with her rent. But, as I read it, nothing that Demand Justice is saying suggests that Biglaw produces inherently bad judges, they’re saying that Biglaw is inherently overrepresented on the judiciary. That’s something I do think should be fixed. The next Democratic president is going to have a wealth of potential judges to choose from (IF. WE. TAKE BACK. THE SENATE!!!!). Telling Democrats to look at non-corporate types, as opposed to picking people who have been “vetted” by Cravath, strikes me as a good thing. It’s one way to fight back against [the Republican effort to reshape the courts](https://www.thenation.com/article/trump-mcconnel-court-judges-plot/) as a place for only white men with arch-conservative views.

Of course, if it were me, I’d have a slightly different unfair categorical ban for my judicial appointments: No career prosecutors. But that’s a battle for another day.

# The Candidate Coup: Are Associates Seizing Control Of The Market?

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

The proliferation of new information, tools, and digital media has made the lateral market more transparent than ever. Associates have been transitioning to informed consumers, empowered to discern previously inscrutable differences between firms. They are able leverage their new market positions and information in order to secure better offers at better firms.

In the past, the blue-chip firms – mainstays of the Am Law 50 – were able to entice lateral associates on prestige alone. While prestige is still a significant factor in associate lateral decisions, the associates we hear from now are more concerned with compensation and future prospects.

An Asymmetrical Market

As the internet evolved, so did the resources available to attorneys. News sites such as Above the Law, forums such as JD Underground, and information databases such as Lateral Link’s were built and launched in the later half of the decade, giving attorneys an inside look and perspective on law firm life, compensation, benefits, and more.

This also had another unintended effect: certain unethical recruiters who previously operated behind smoke and mirrors became subject to fact-checking and could be branded as untrustworthy.

The evolution of the internet was the impetus behind shifting the market from an asymmetric to a symmetrical one. Armed with information, attorneys could leverage this knowledge to secure better positions and compensation packages, including benefits that they did not know previously existed.

However, it was not yet an associate-driven market.

Shifting Market Realities

Thanks to rising law school tuition costs, largely static salaries, and increased costs of living, the new salary standard Cravath set earlier this summer does not quite match the perks of being a Biglaw attorney in the early 2000s. As [we’ve noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/is-ny-to-180k-hurting-the-new-york-market/) in the past, these new raises are not really raises at all when adjusted for inflation. In fact, for most locksteps, they track lower than their adjusted rate from 2007, when Biglaw last raised associate salaries. Meanwhile, associates are arguably the most profitable employees at law firms, and the clamor for raises over the last few years is indicative of this increased awareness.

Compounding this unfavorable climate, law school debt in 2015 averaged $140,000 per student – 86% greater than it was in 2004. In 2006, Congress extended the Federal Direct Plus Loan Program to fully cover graduate and professional students. This allowed students to borrow the entirety of their tuition and cost of living allowances. Another unintended consequence was that law schools saw themselves taking advantage of monies available to students and increased tuition costs. It is now 25% more expensive to go to law school today than it was in 2006.

Consequently, law school attendance has dropped significantly since the early 2000s — and, unsurprisingly, bar passage rates have also plummeted. Fewer and fewer Biglaw-caliber associates are entering the market ever year. In tandem, firms are increasing to unparalleled sizes through mergers and general accretive lateral and law school hiring.

The Fallout

Conjecture is an entertaining exercise, but any decent conjecture requires some proof to substantiate it. To test these theories, we queried a random sample of 30 associate placements from our internal candidate tracking system to see how the hiring process for associates has changed in the last three years as firms have prioritized growth.

Overall, the average time from submission to receiving an offer was down 11%. However, this is far from the most interesting statistic. The average time from an offer received to an offer accepted has more than doubled. Why? Associates are asking questions, in addition to being presented with more offers than ever.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Lateral-Link-Candidate-Coup-2.png)

As supply decreases and demand increases, firms are fighting over the same scarce resources. In the past, an associate could largely count on a handful of firms that fit their requisite needs and whose requirements they met as well. Variables like specialty, location, and conflicts already greatly limit the pool of possible firms. However, with increased competition, this “handful” of possible firms has greatly increased.

Now, firms are gearing up for the continually dwindling supply of associates. Cravath’s new round of raises might be seen as a preventive measure that both entices laterals from other firms who do not have the flexibility to match, and rights the market enough to coax promising undergraduates to apply to law school.

The Bottom Line

There has never been a better time for an associate to make a lateral move. Because of Cravath’s raises, the small uptick in law school applications may start growing again. Associates are taking advantage of these unique conditions to test the market and see if there is a firm out there that offers more compensation, a better office culture, and tangible opportunities to grow in their chosen practice area – and most oftentimes there is.

We’ve all done it. Playing dumb is a vital part of any petty person’s repertoire. [Diplomatic strategies](https://www.inc.com/kimberly-weisul/seven-smart-ways-to-play-dumb-literally.html) like saying, “Sorry, I didn’t catch that,” to something you definitely caught to force the other person to hear how stupid what they just said was or only responding to the parts of an email or text that you feel like entertaining have their places. The courtroom may not be one of them. If they read it earlier, these two cents could have saved Gibson Dunn and Meta about a million dollars. From Law360:

Facebook and its counsel [Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP](https://www.law360.com/firms/gibson-dunn) must pay $925,000 to social media users in multidistrict litigation over the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, a California federal judge ruled Thursday, citing their “unusually egregious and persistent” misconduct delaying discovery and gaslighting of opponents in seeking to extract a lower-priced settlement.

Gibson knew [Gatekeep, Gaslight, Girlboss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUpiqB5lf0k) was just supposed to be a meme, right?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in a scathing [order](https://assets.law360news.com/1574000/1574896/https-ecf-cand-uscourts-gov-doc1-035122820656.pdf)partially granted the Facebook users’ [$2 million sanctions bid](https://www.law360.com/articles/1551590), finding that the [Meta Platforms Inc](https://www.law360.com/companies/meta-platforms-inc). unit and its counsel at Gibson Dunn used “delay, misdirection and frivolous arguments to make litigation unfairly difficult and expensive for their opponents.”

While this kind of litigation conduct isn’t uncommon, the judge said in this case it was “unusually egregious and persistent.”

“Sometimes lawyers and their clients engage in conduct of this sort because they are incompetent. Facebook and Gibson Dunn are not incompetent,” Judge Chhabria said.

I love a good competency is culpability compliment. What response do Meta and Gibson have? “No your honor, you don’t understand. We are total clown shoes and had no idea that egregious and persistent strategies were inconveniencing opposing counsel. The Ivy League degrees we’re all decked out in are just because our parents are rich.” [And while that last part may actually be true](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/antitrust-suit-sets-stage-to-see-if-yale-columbia-and-others-are-institutes-of-higher-learning-or-higher-income/), Gibson can’t openly admit that if they want to continue billing their clients $600 an hour for doc review.

“[T]he court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Facebook and Gibson Dunn’s conduct reflected a sustained, concerted, bad-faith effort to throw obstacle after obstacle in front of the plaintiffs — all in an attempt to push the plaintiffs into settling the case for less than they would have gotten otherwise,” he said.

…

Facebook’s witnesses and lawyers also deliberately prevented the users from getting probative information during depositions, the order states. For instance, during the deposition of a Facebook employee who was testifying about the company’s information-sharing practices, a Gibson Dunn attorney told the witness not to answer “at least 22 times,” according to the order.

The behavior exhibited was in bad form to opposing counsel, but here’s whey they messed up. They went so far as to annoy the court too!

“All the while, Facebook and Gibson Dunn had the [audacity to accuse](https://www.law360.com/articles/1483408) the plaintiffs’ lawyers of delaying the case, and to assert that the plaintiffs’ reasonable efforts to obtain obviously relevant discovery were frivolous,” Judge Chhabria said. “It’s almost as if Facebook and Gibson Dunn spent the better part of three years trying to gaslight their opponents, not to mention the court.”

Word to the wise, it is really hard to [DARVO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muh_rO_0xtc) when there is a paper trail that shows what you’re doing. When people can see what you’re doing, act like it. You’d think Meta would know a thing or two about surveillance. Meta and Gibson are jointly liable to pay up for $925k within 21 days. If billable rates or advertisement costs go up in the near future, this may be why.

# Biglaw Firms Stink At Serving Smaller Clients
## The high rates charged by larger law firms can prevent them from sufficiently serving smaller clients.

‘Your firm is too big for me.’

Biglaw firms are great at handling bigger cases and transactional matters.  Indeed, Biglaw firms can devote many attorneys to a particular case, and can deploy other resources to assist corporate clients successfully manage complicated matters.  The services Biglaw firms provide do not come cheap, and this is why Biglaw firms typically serve massive companies and individuals with deep pockets.

Sometimes, however, Biglaw firms decide to work for smaller clients.  In certain instances, Biglaw firms take on smaller clients as a favor to their existing clients, and other times, [this is because low-performing partners want to earn origination points](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/extra-money-main-job/).  In any case, from my own experience, Biglaw firms usually have a number of issues handling smaller matters.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
One of the main reasons why Biglaw firms are inefficient when serving smaller clients is because of the insane hourly rates charged by many large law firms.  Sometimes, Biglaw firms give smaller clients a break, and charge smaller clients lower fees than usual.  However, the fees typically charged by large law firms still greatly exceed the hourly rates of smaller firms.  While large corporate clients might not bat an eye at a huge legal bill, smaller clients are much more likely to protest the fees charged by a Biglaw firm.

In order to charge less money to smaller clients, many partners at Biglaw firms typically task more junior attorneys with working on smaller matters.  More junior lawyers usually have a lower billable-hour rate, although this amount is still typically much higher than the rate charged by even seasoned partners at smaller firms.  In any case, junior attorneys in Biglaw can do more work at a lower cost to the client than a more senior attorney.  In addition, partners may think that working on smaller matters can be a great experience for associates, [and as I mentioned last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/partners-could-hurt-clients-if-they-dont-let-associates-argue-motions/), it can of course be a good idea to let associates handle matters.

However, sometimes Biglaw partners can [greatly restrict the number of hours an associate has to work on smaller matters](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/time-side-hustles/), since smaller clients cannot afford to pay larger bills.  When I was working in Biglaw, I felt extremely rushed when only given a few hours to conduct some research projects for smaller clients.  [I definitely did not do my best work due to these time limitations](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/balance-side-hustles-main-job/), and time restrictions were almost never set for our larger clients.

Some partners would even force me to use a non-billable number for some of the time I worked on smaller matters.  In other instances, I could not record this time at all, since some Biglaw firms penalize partners if they have to write off time worked by a more junior attorney.  Associates hated this practice, since we were all trying to meet billable-hour requirements, and writing off time could impede associates from hitting billable-hour goals.  Due to these billing practices, smaller clients sometimes only received the attention of junior attorneys who did not have sufficient time to adequately work on a particular matter.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
When I was in Biglaw, there was a time when a fellow junior associate was tasked with working on a smaller matter for a friend of a partner.  Since the partner was trying to keep costs down, the partner was hardly involved in the case, and the junior attorney had a limited amount of time to work on the matter.  My colleague did not know that you had to attach certain exhibits to a motion, and the partner never bothered to check the papers before they were filed, since the partner was more concerned with larger matters.  This resulted in a huge mess-up that had to be corrected by devoting a substantial amount of time that couldn’t be billed to the client.  Of course, this situation would have likely not occurred with a larger client, since the partner would be more involved in the matter, and the associate would have had additional time to get things right the first time.

It can also be more difficult for a Biglaw firm to provide concierge service to smaller clients.  Many Biglaw practice groups only have several huge clients for which they work.  Indeed, when I worked in Biglaw, we only had three or four clients that accounted for nearly all of the work billed by myself and my colleagues.  As a result, we used specialized reporting formats at the request of these large clients, and we used billing narratives, billing guidelines, and even some abbreviations that were tailored to the clients’ needs.

Whenever we did work for a few smaller clients, we usually just conducted ourselves as we did when we were working for larger clients.  We usually did not make changes to how we operated for smaller clients, and I remember one occasion when a smaller client was upset at not being informed about a certain development in a case.  We would never inform our larger clients of this development, and the inertia of working for large clients can sometimes limit the services Biglaw firms can provide to smaller clients.

All told, Biglaw firms are great at serving larger clients and working on bigger matters.  However, Biglaw firms can really stink at handling smaller clients and cases.  The high rates charged by larger law firms can prevent them from sufficiently serving smaller clients, since this limits the amount of time and attention Biglaw attorneys have to work on smaller matters.

Love on the rocks! The [contemplated merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/can-a-merger-move-improve-morale-at-reed-smith/) between Reed Smith and Pepper Hamilton was not meant to be. According to [The Legal Intelligencer](http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202755774312/Pepper-Hamilton-and-Reed-Smith-End-Merger-Discussions), the talks were called off late Friday.

Predictably, both public statements were polite, cordial, and totally devoid of any real details about the merger talks:

According to a statement late Friday from Pepper Hamilton confirming that talks were ending, the firm said, “Today, Pepper Hamilton decided to end our discussions with Reed Smith. While we were intrigued when Reed Smith approached us, we determined that moving forward is not in the best interest of Pepper. Pepper prides itself on talented people providing premier legal services to our clients. These core Pepper values are what we do best, and it is why our firm is held in such high regard by our clients and the entire legal community.”

In a statement Friday, Reed Smith said that “in order to better serve our global clients,” the firm “periodically has discussions with other firms regarding joining forces.” Reed Smith said it had “preliminary” discussions with Pepper Hamilton, a firm it said it knows well and respects.

“While our conversations with Pepper Hamilton were positive and informative, both firms have concluded that for a variety of reasons those discussions should end,” Reed Smith said in a statement.

The Legal Intelligencer also got a hold of an internal Pepper Hamilton email from Chairman Thomas M. Gallagher explaining Pepper Hamilton was the dumper in this potential merger:

“Consistent with our strategy, our primary focus has always been on our people and our clients, and we believe it is appropriate to end our discussions with Reed Smith, a highly-respected firm. We will continue to be faithful to our strategy.”

If Reed Smith wants to merge, it looks like it will have to look somewhere else.

# Two Biglaw Attorneys Have Made Their Way Onto The Trump Hush Money Jury
## Legal industry insiders are on the case.

If I had a nickel for every time a Biglaw attorney wound up on the Trump hush money jury, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice. Like, I know New York City is very much the epicenter of the Biglaw world, but it still wows me that not one, but two Biglaw attorneys are on the Trump jury.

In the first two days of jury selection, 7 members of the jury were chosen and [anonymized sketches](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/04/trump-trial-what-we-know-first-seven-jurors.html) of who will determine the fate of the former president are making the rounds. But, for legal industry insiders, the attorneys that litter the jury are the most fascinating aspect. There was a time when being a lawyer all but guaranteed a strike, but with the hyper specialization of the legal field, prosecutors and defense attorneys are much more willing to take a chance on a juror with a JD.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So, what *do* we know about these Biglaw attorneys? [According to ](https://www.law360.com/articles/1826147)Law360, one is a civil litigator at Hunton Andrews Kurth, the other a corporate attorney at Gunderson Dettmer.

[T]he Hunton Andrews attorney described his political views about the Trump presidency as a mixed bag. He said he had no opinions about Trump personally.

The juror said he’d have no trouble reconciling his job as a lawyer and serving in a criminal case.

“I’m a civil litigator, which means I know virtually nothing about criminal,” he said. “I don’t know anything about election or finance law either.”

To the extent that he has any knowledge of those areas of law, the attorney said he believes he can put it aside while serving as a juror.

The corporate attorney is juror No. 3. He [reportedly](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/04/trump-trial-what-we-know-first-seven-jurors.html) told prosecutors you “don’t need to read somebody’s mind” to reach a conclusion on criminal intent.” As to the other charges pending against Trump on other venues, he said, “I’m not super familiar with the other charges.” He continued, “I don’t really follow the news that closely, unfortunately.” Probably too busy billing.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Phased Transition Back To Work That's Sure To Please Associates
## This plan will be a hit because employees are being gently eased back into office life.

Spring has officially sprung across the country, and plans for safe office reopenings at Biglaw firms are slowly but surely budding up and coming to life. Today, we have news from an Am Law firm whose return-to-work plan will gently ease attorneys and staff back to work through various transition phases leading up to a full return after Labor Day.

According to our sources, Lowenstein Sandler — a firm that brought in gross revenue of $350.1 million in 2020 — has announced a reopening plan that will help all employees reacquaint themselves with office life before a full September return. The firm launched a soft reopening on July 22, 2020, and has been providing free lunches for anyone working from any of their offices since then, and will continue to do so this summer. These are the three return phases that will be occurring at Lowenstein, as detailed in an email sent on April 30 (available on the next page):

- Between now and July 4, we welcome you to try out the office to get reacquainted with working in person again and to test out some of our new technology. In June, we’ll have some scheduled open house days to see your colleagues and, of course, offer food and prizes. Our offices (other than Palo Alto) remain open and you can continue to work from the office as often as you prefer.
- July and August will be a transition period. Beginning July 6, we welcome and encourage you to return to the office on a voluntary basis a day or two each week, or more if you prefer. Many of our practice groups and BSG [Business Service Group] teams will be scheduling regular days when people on those teams who are comfortable doing so will be in the office and can collaborate in person. You should not feel obligated to work from the office during this transition period, but we believe it is beneficial to give everyone the opportunity to transition back in a coordinated way before September. Lunch will continue to be “on the firm” through the summer.
- After Labor Day and through the end of the year, our general expectation is that you are going to be regularly working in one of our offices most of the time – which means typically around 3 or more days per week, unless you obtain approval from your Practice Group Leader or Senior BSG Manager for some other schedule. This expectation might be modified based on client, practice group, or BSG team requirements or if you have job responsibilities or career development opportunities that require you to be in the office more often. As we get closer to September, we’ll provide further guidance on how this will work.

Note that employees are expected to be in the office “most of the time” (i.e., three or more days each week), meaning that some work-from-home flexibility is on the table. Lowenstein is “strongly encourag[ing]” employees to get vaccinated, but will not require vaccination for anyone to return to the office (although this policy may change). The firm will be limiting the number of people in its offices to no more than 50 percent of capacity, until the CDC revises its guidelines for indoor gatherings. All employees who come to the office must complete an online health questionnaire each day, and safety protocols like social distancing and mask wearing must be adhered to at all times.

Congratulations to Lowenstein Sandler on creating what looks like a well-planned and safe reopening plan for all employees. We suspect that this may be one that other firms may wish to model due to its flexibility.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please email us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Say Something, Biglaw
## We should know better than most that Black Lives Matter.

Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch in ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’

The tragic, inexcusable death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has sparked protests, community building, and dialogue. It’s also restarted a national conversation about systemic racism. While rooted in terrible loss, these past few weeks seem to be leading to a long-overdue awakening in parts of the public.

I’ve been heartened to see how many businesses have been out front and vocal in their support of racial equality in the wake of George Floyd’s death. Millions have been donated to a wide variety of causes that support social and racial justice. Only a month ago, tagging a corporate post #BLM would have been “too controversial” for most PR departments to sign off on. Now, billion-dollar companies, CEOs, and leaders on both sides of the aisle are issuing press releases, making statements, and filling our Twitter feeds with full-throated endorsements of the Black Lives Matter movement. Even Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner who previously sided against Colin Kaepernick and banned his players from taking a knee in protest of a society they see as largely stacked against black people, has [admitted publicly that Black Lives Matter](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1269034074552721408?s=20).

Why Is This So Hard For Biglaw To Say?

Yet, for all the many national companies and voices pledging to listen and act better, our own segment of the market remains quiet. Above The Law has been [tracking and compiling](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/?rf=1) the statements and actions of Biglaw firms in support of racial equality. As of this writing, they’ve compiled around 60 statements, many coupled with concrete pledges of action or resources.

While 60 Biglaw allies are better than none, it still means roughly 70% of the Am Law 200 has evidently remained publicly silent in this moment — not even acknowledging what’s happening in the country or speaking out against racism.

Law firms get a lot of flak for being behind the curve. We’ve historically lagged on issues like technology adoption, management practice, embracing distributed workplaces, and other topics where the price of falling behind isn’t ultimately that huge. We leave money on the table and cede market share to our competitors at our peril, but that’s one of the challenges of an industry centered around people trained in risk aversion and issue spotting. Lawyers tend to have a professionally instilled preference for stability and calm.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But on the topic of racism, we have no excuse for remaining behind the times. Justice is literally our business. We are too well trained in reviewing evidence and weighing equities not to see what is right in front of us. We swear an oath to serve justice as a condition of our admission to the bar. This kind of issue is right in our wheelhouse. We have no excuse to not be on the cutting edge.

The fear, of course, is that taking a side on an issue can be bad for business. Like it or not, Biglaw serves powerful, wealthy clients, some of whom may have differing views on the issues the country is facing. A diminishing — but still distressing — percentage of Americans remain steadfastly opposed to acknowledging systemic oppression or discrimination. For fear of driving away that business, of losing some of our livelihood, many choose to remain silent.

But how can we be advocates for justice and not speak out?

Our Profession’s Mutual Client

The story of Atticus Finch is built into the foundation of American lawyerdom. To Kill A Mockingbird, both the 1960 novel and the 1962 film, contain some of the most heroic depictions of the American attorney in literature or film. In it, Finch argues eloquently and compassionately for a higher form of justice than his small Southern town is ultimately willing to give. Though he unjustly loses the case, his integrity and fair-mindedness have been an inspiration to legions of real-life attorneys who have cited him as the model for their own careers.

What’s often forgotten in the story of Atticus Finch, however, is the man he defended. Tom Robinson, a black man, is wrongfully convicted of raping a white woman. Overt racial overtones permeate the book’s pages. Fast forward to today, and we can see that the plea to end systemic oppression referred to as the Black Lives Matter movement is not new. Black Americans have been screaming for justice for generations. Lawyers, more than most, have a responsibility to listen to and amplify those voices. We need to live up to our own founding myth.

For my part and that of many industry colleagues, we unequivocally agree that Black Lives Matter. This statement is not about supporting the agenda of any particular organization, calls to defund law enforcement, or anything of the sort. Instead, it’s a broader call to racial equality in all of society. It’s about being better, listening to the voices and stories of those affected by racism and inequality, and taking whatever steps forward we can toward a more just world. To those of my profession who have yet to speak out about racism and the need to improve diversity and inclusion, it’s not too late. Our industry, our communities, and our country need your help.

# 2023 Am Law 100 Rankings: A Comprehensive Breakdown
## Discover the latest Am Law 100 rankings as they reveal the shift in financial metrics, unveiling which firms triumphed and which faced challenges in 2022.

For top Biglaw firms, [2021 was an incredible year](https://laterallink.com/a-detailed-breakdown-of-the-2022-am-law-100-rankings%EF%BF%BC/): gross revenue rose nearly 15%, while profits per equity partner grew almost 20%. Those growth rates were obviously unsustainable, so there is no great surprise that the financial metrics reported in the just-released [2023 edition of the Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/am-law-100/) indicate a return to earth. 2022 was a roughly flat—for many firms, somewhat down—year. But considering the lofty heights reached in 2021, that actually isn’t so bad.

Collectively, in 2022, [the AmLaw 100 attained](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/18/the-2023-am-law-100-by-the-numbers/):

- Total revenue: $130.8 billion, up by 2.7%.
- Average revenue per lawyer: $1.16 million, down by 1.9%.
- Profits per equity partner: $2.56 million, down by 3.7%.
For context, let’s compare the 2022 growth rates to the remarkably strong growth of 2021 and 2020, as well as the more typical rates of 2019:



Positive revenue growth paired with declining RPL implies that increases in headcount played a material role. Indeed, total Am Law 100 headcount rose 4.7% (approximately 5,000 additional lawyers), with equity partnerships expanding by 1% (+207 equity partners) and the nonequity partner pool growing by 6.4% (+1,175 nonequity partners). This is consistent with our observations of the 2022 lateral market: even as deal work took a hit, 2022 was a reasonably strong year for lateral hiring.

Let’s now take a closer look at the three most important metrics — gross revenue, revenue per lawyer, and profits per partner — and the top 10 firms in each category.

Gross Revenue

Here are the top 10 firms in the 2023 Am Law 100 rankings, ranked by their gross revenue in 2022. You can access the full list [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/18/the-2023-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/).



Kirkland & Ellis once again led the pack, widening its lead over Latham & Watkins, which maintained its second-place position despite a decline in revenue. There was little change to the top group, with Gibson Dunn entering the top 10 and Hogan Lovells dropping down to the 12th slot.

Most of the top 10 firms achieved revenue gains, but this was not representative of the broader Am Law 100. Although overall Am Law 100 revenue increased in 2022, 59 of the 100 firms suffered a revenue decline. This was a marked reversal from 2021, when every Am Law 100 firm increased revenue year-over-year.

Revenue Per Lawyer

Here are the top 10 firms in the 2023 Am Law 100 rankings based on revenue per lawyer. You can access the full list [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/18/the-2023-am-law-100-ranked-by-revenue-per-lawyer/).



It was not a great year for revenue per lawyer among the Am Law elite, highlighted by the 12% declines for Davis Polk and Simpson Thacher. Wachtell, Sullivan & Cromwell, Cravath, and Kirkland maintained their positions at the top of the table despite RPL decreases. Proskauer was the only new entrant into the top 10, with Quinn Emanuel falling to the 13th slot due to a 13% RPL decline—a notable hit in a relatively strong year for litigation.

Profits Per Equity Partner

And finally, the ranking we’ve all been waiting for: the top 10 firms by profits per equity partner. You can access the full list [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/18/the-2023-am-law-100-ranked-by-profits-per-equity-partner/).



The big news is that Kirkland has overtaken perennial champion Wachtell as leader of the PPEP ranking. Wachtell made history in 2021 as the first firm to exceed the $8 million PPEP mark. But a 13% drop in 2022—in the face of Kirkland’s 2% increase—has dislodged Wachtell from the top spot.

Wachtell’s percentage decline is not the highest among the top 10: that title goes to Davis Polk, which suffered a whopping 21% drop in PPEP. In the process, Davis Polk fell from the third slot to the fifth. New entrants into the top 10 were Skadden and Gibson Dunn. They displaced Cravath, which fell to 13th thanks to a 19% PPEP decline, and Cahill, which fell out of the Am Law 100 entirely.

In 2022, 9 Am Law 100 firms achieved profits per equity partner above $5 million (compared to 14 in 2021 and 6 in 2020). It wasn’t the year some firms might have hoped for, but even so, being an Am Law 100 equity partner in 2022 was still substantially more lucrative than prior to the pandemic.
